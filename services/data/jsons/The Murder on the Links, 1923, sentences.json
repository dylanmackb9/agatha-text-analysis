    "\nThe Murder on the Links\n\n\n\nby Agatha Christie\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\nTO MY HUSBAND\n\nA fellow enthusiast for detective stories and to whom I am indebted for much helpful advice and criticism.",
    "1\n\nA Fellow Traveller\n\n\nI believe that a wellknown anecdote exists to the effect that a young writer determined to make the commencement of his story forcible and original enough to catch and rivet the attention of the most blas\u00e9 of editors penned the following sentence\n\n\u201c\u200a\u2018Hell\u2019 said the Duchess.\u201d\n\nStrangely enough this tale of mine opens in much the same fashion.",
    "Only the lady who gave utterance to the exclamation was not a Duchess\n\nIt was a day in early June.",
    "I had been transacting some business in Paris and was returning by the morning service to London where I was still sharing rooms with my old friend the Belgian exdetective Hercule Poirot.",
    "The Calais express was singularly empty\u2014in fact my own compartment held only one other traveller.",
    "I had made a somewhat hurried departure from the hotel and was busy assuring myself that I had duly collected all my traps when the train started.",
    "Up till then I had hardly noticed my companion but I was now violently recalled to the fact of her existence.",
    "Jumping up from her seat she let down the window and stuck her head out withdrawing it a moment later with the brief and forcible ejaculation \u201cHell\u201d\n\nNow I am oldfashioned.",
    "A woman I consider should be womanly.",
    "I have no patience with the modern neurotic girl who jazzes from morning to night smokes like a chimney and uses language which would make a Billingsgate fishwoman blush\n\nI looked up now frowning slightly into a pretty impudent face surmounted by a rakish little red hat.",
    "A thick cluster of black curls hid each ear.",
    "I judged that she was little more than seventeen but her face was covered with powder and her lips were quite impossibly scarlet.",
    "Nothing abashed she returned my glance and executed an expressive grimace.",
    "\u201cDear me we\u2019ve shocked the kind gentleman\u201d she observed to an imaginary audience.",
    "\u201cI apologize for my language Most unladylike and all that but Oh Lord there\u2019s reason enough for it Do you know I\u2019ve lost my only sister\u201d\n\n\u201cReally\u201d I said politely.",
    "\u201cHow unfortunate.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe disapproves\u201d remarked the lady.",
    "\u201cHe disapproves utterly\u2014of me and my sister\u2014which last is unfair because he hasn\u2019t seen her\u201d\n\nI opened my mouth but she forestalled me.",
    "\u201cSay no more Nobody loves me I shall go into the garden and eat worms Boohoo I am crushed\u201d\n\nShe buried herself behind a large comic French paper.",
    "In a minute or two I saw her eyes stealthily peeping at me over the top.",
    "In spite of myself I could not help smiling and in a minute she had tossed the paper aside and had burst into a merry peal of laughter.",
    "\u201cI knew you weren\u2019t such a mutt as you looked\u201d she cried.",
    "Her laughter was so infectious that I could not help joining in though I hardly cared for the word \u201cmutt.\u201d The girl was certainly all that I most disliked but that was no reason why I should make myself ridiculous by my attitude.",
    "I prepared to unbend.",
    "After all she was decidedly pretty.",
    "\u2026\n\n\u201cThere Now we\u2019re friends\u201d declared the minx.",
    "\u201cSay you\u2019re sorry about my sister\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI am desolated\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a good boy\u201d\n\n\u201cLet me finish.",
    "I was going to add that although I am desolated I can manage to put up with her absence very well.\u201d I made a little bow.",
    "But this most unaccountable of damsels frowned and shook her head.",
    "\u201cCut it out.",
    "I prefer the \u2018dignified disapproval\u2019 stunt.",
    "Oh your face \u2018Not one of us\u2019 it said.",
    "And you were right there\u2014though mind you it\u2019s pretty hard to tell nowadays.",
    "It\u2019s not every one who can distinguish between a demi and a duchess.",
    "There now I believe I\u2019ve shocked you again You\u2019ve been dug out of the backwoods you have.",
    "Not that I mind that.",
    "We could do with a few more of your sort.",
    "I just hate a fellow who gets fresh.",
    "It makes me mad.\u201d\n\nShe shook her head vigorously.",
    "\u201cWhat are you like when you\u2019re mad\u201d I inquired with a smile.",
    "\u201cA regular little devil Don\u2019t care what I say or what I do either I nearly did a chap in once.",
    "Yes really.",
    "He\u2019d have deserved it too.",
    "Italian blood I\u2019ve got.",
    "I shall get into trouble one of these days.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell\u201d I begged \u201cdon\u2019t get mad with me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI shan\u2019t.",
    "I like you\u2014did the first moment I set eyes on you.",
    "But you looked so disapproving that I never thought we should make friends.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell we have.",
    "Tell me something about yourself.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m an actress.",
    "No\u2014not the kind you\u2019re thinking of lunching at the Savoy covered with jewellery and with their photograph in every paper saying how much they love Madame So and So\u2019s face cream.",
    "I\u2019ve been on the boards since I was a kid of six\u2014tumbling.\u201d\n\n\u201cI beg your pardon\u201d I said puzzled.",
    "\u201cHaven\u2019t you seen child acrobats\u201d\n\n\u201cOh I understand.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m American born but I\u2019ve spent most of my life in England.",
    "We got a new show now\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u201d\n\n\u201cMy sister and I.",
    "Sort of song and dance and a bit of patter and a dash of the old business thrown in.",
    "It\u2019s quite a new idea and it hits them every time.",
    "There\u2019s to be money in it\u2014\u201d\n\nMy new acquaintance leaned forward and discoursed volubly a great many of her terms being quite unintelligible to me.",
    "Yet I found myself evincing an increasing interest in her.",
    "She seemed such a curious mixture of child and woman.",
    "Though perfectly worldlywise and able as she expressed it to take care of herself there was yet something curiously ingenuous in her singleminded attitude towards life and her wholehearted determination to \u201cmake good.\u201d This glimpse of a world unknown to me was not without its charm and I enjoyed seeing her vivid little face light up as she talked.",
    "We passed through Amiens.",
    "The name awakened many memories.",
    "My companion seemed to have an intuitive knowledge of what was in my mind.",
    "\u201cThinking of the War\u201d\n\nI nodded.",
    "\u201cYou were through it I suppose\u201d\n\n\u201cPretty well.",
    "I was wounded once and after the Somme they invalided me out altogether.",
    "I had a half fledged Army job for a bit.",
    "I\u2019m a sort of private secretary now to an M. P.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy That\u2019s brainy\u201d\n\n\u201cNo it isn\u2019t.",
    "There\u2019s really awfully little to do.",
    "Usually a couple of hours every day sees me through.",
    "It\u2019s dull work too.",
    "In fact I don\u2019t know what I should do if I hadn\u2019t got something to fall back upon.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t say you collect bugs\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.",
    "I share rooms with a very interesting man.",
    "He\u2019s a Belgian\u2014an exdetective.",
    "He\u2019s set up as a private detective in London and he\u2019s doing extraordinarily well.",
    "He\u2019s really a very marvellous little man.",
    "Time and again he has proved to be right where the official police have failed.\u201d\n\nMy companion listened with widening eyes.",
    "\u201cIsn\u2019t that interesting now I just adore crime.",
    "I go to all the mysteries on the movies.",
    "And when there\u2019s a murder on I just devour the papers.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you remember the Styles Case\u201d I asked.",
    "\u201cLet me see was that the old lady who was poisoned Somewhere down in Essex\u201d\n\nI nodded.",
    "\u201cThat was Poirot\u2019s first big case.",
    "Undoubtedly but for him the murderer would have escaped scotfree.",
    "It was a most wonderful bit of detective work.\u201d\n\nWarming to my subject I ran over the heads of the affair working up to the triumphant and unexpected d\u00e9nouement.",
    "The girl listened spellbound.",
    "In fact we were so absorbed that the train drew into Calais station before we realized it.",
    "\u201cMy goodness gracious me\u201d cried my companion.",
    "\u201cWhere\u2019s my powderpuff\u201d\n\nShe proceeded to bedaub her face liberally and then applied a stick of lip salve to her lips observing the effect in a small pocket glass and betraying not the faintest sign of selfconsciousness.",
    "\u201cI say\u201d I hesitated.",
    "\u201cI dare say it\u2019s cheek on my part but why do all that sort of thing\u201d\n\nThe girl paused in her operations and stared at me with undisguised surprise.",
    "\u201cIt isn\u2019t as though you weren\u2019t so pretty that you can afford to do without it\u201d I said stammeringly.",
    "\u201cMy dear boy I\u2019ve got to do it.",
    "All the girls do.",
    "Think I want to look like a little frump up from the country\u201d She took one last look in the mirror smiled approval and put it and her vanitybox away in her bag.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s better.",
    "Keeping up appearances is a bit of a fag I grant but if a girl respects herself it\u2019s up to her not to let herself get slack.\u201d\n\nTo this essentially moral sentiment I had no reply.",
    "A point of view makes a great difference.",
    "I secured a couple of porters and we alighted on the platform.",
    "My companion held out her hand.",
    "\u201cGoodbye and I\u2019ll mind my language better in future.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh but surely you\u2019ll let me look after you on the boat\u201d\n\n\u201cMayn\u2019t be on the boat.",
    "I\u2019ve got to see whether that sister of mine got aboard after all anywhere.",
    "But thanks all the same.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh but we\u2019re going to meet again surely I\u2014\u201d I hesitated.",
    "\u201cI want to meet your sister.\u201d\n\nWe both laughed.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s real nice of you.",
    "I\u2019ll tell her what you say.",
    "But I don\u2019t fancy we\u2019ll meet again.",
    "You\u2019ve been very good to me on the journey especially after I cheeked you as I did.",
    "But what your face expressed first thing is quite true.",
    "I\u2019m not your kind.",
    "And that brings trouble\u2014I know that well enough.",
    "\u2026\u201d\n\nHer face changed.",
    "For the moment all the lighthearted gaiety died out of it.",
    "It looked angry\u2014revengeful.",
    "\u2026\n\n\u201cSo goodbye\u201d she finished in a lighter tone.",
    "\u201cAren\u2019t you even going to tell me your name\u201d I cried as she turned away.",
    "She looked over her shoulder.",
    "A dimple appeared in each cheek.",
    "She was like a lovely picture by Greuze.",
    "\u201cCinderella\u201d she said and laughed.",
    "But little did I think when and how I should see Cinderella again.",
    "2\n\nAn Appeal for Help\n\n\nIt was five minutes past nine when I entered our joint sittingroom for breakfast on the following morning.",
    "My friend Poirot exact to the minute as usual was just tapping the shell of his second egg.",
    "He beamed upon me as I entered.",
    "\u201cYou have slept well yes You have recovered from the crossing so terrible It is a marvel almost you are exact this morning.",
    "Pardon but your tie is not symmetrical.",
    "Permit that I rearrange him.\u201d\n\nElsewhere I have described Hercule Poirot.",
    "An extraordinary little man Height five feet four inches eggshaped head carried a little to one side eyes that shone green when he was excited stiff military moustache air of dignity immense He was neat and dandified in appearance.",
    "For neatness of any kind he had an absolute passion.",
    "To see an ornament set crooked or a speck of dust or a slight disarray in one\u2019s attire was torture to the little man until he could ease his feelings by remedying the matter.",
    "\u201cOrder\u201d and \u201cMethod\u201d were his gods.",
    "He had a certain disdain for tangible evidence such as footprints and cigarette ash and would maintain that taken by themselves they would never enable a detective to solve a problem.",
    "Then he would tap his eggshaped head with absurd complacency and remark with great satisfaction \u201cThe true work it is done from within.",
    "The little grey cells\u2014remember always the little grey cells mon ami\u201d\n\nI slipped into my seat and remarked idly in answer to Poirot\u2019s greeting that an hour\u2019s sea passage from Calais to Dover could hardly be dignified by the epithet \u201cterrible.\u201d\n\nPoirot waved his eggspoon in vigorous refutation of my remark.",
    "\u201cDu tout If for an hour one experiences sensations and emotions of the most terrible one has lived many hours Does not one of your English poets say that time is counted not by hours but by heartbeats\u201d\n\n\u201cI fancy Browning was referring to something more romantic than sea sickness though.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause he was an Englishman an Islander to whom la Manche was nothing.",
    "Oh you English With nous autres it is different.",
    "Figure to yourself that a lady of my acquaintance at the beginning of the war fled to Ostend.",
    "There she had a terrible crisis of the nerves.",
    "Impossible to escape further except by crossing the sea And she had a horror\u2014mais une horreur\u2014of the sea What was she to do Daily les Boches were drawing nearer.",
    "Imagine to yourself the terrible situation\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat did she do\u201d I inquired curiously.",
    "\u201cFortunately her husband was homme pratique.",
    "He was also very calm the crises of the nerves they affected him not.",
    "Il l\u2019a emport\u00e9e simplement Naturally when she reached England she was prostrate but she still breathed.\u201d\n\nPoirot shook his head seriously.",
    "I composed my face as best I could.",
    "Suddenly he stiffened and pointed a dramatic finger at the toast rack.",
    "\u201cAh par exemple c\u2019est trop fort\u201d he cried.",
    "\u201cWhat is it\u201d\n\n\u201cThis piece of toast.",
    "You remark him not\u201d He whipped the offender out of the rack and held it up for me to examine.",
    "\u201cIs it square No.",
    "Is it a triangle Again no.",
    "Is it even round No.",
    "Is it of any shape remotely pleasing to the eye What symmetry have we here None.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s cut from a cottage loaf\u201d I explained soothingly.",
    "Poirot threw me a withering glance.",
    "\u201cWhat an intelligence has my friend Hastings\u201d he exclaimed sarcastically.",
    "\u201cComprehend you not that I have forbidden such a loaf\u2014a loaf haphazard and shapeless that no baker should permit himself to bake\u201d\n\nI endeavoured to distract his mind.",
    "\u201cAnything interesting come by the post\u201d\n\nPoirot shook his head with a dissatisfied air.",
    "\u201cI have not yet examined my letters but nothing of interest arrives nowadays.",
    "The great criminals the criminals of method they do not exist.",
    "The cases I have been employed upon lately were banal to the last degree.",
    "In verity I am reduced to recovering lost lapdogs for fashionable ladies The last problem that presented any interest was that intricate little affair of the Yardly diamond and that was\u2014how many months ago my friend\u201d\n\nHe shook his head despondently and I roared with laughter.",
    "\u201cCheer up Poirot the luck will change.",
    "Open your letters.",
    "For all you know there may be a great Case looming on the horizon.\u201d\n\nPoirot smiled and taking up the neat little letter opener with which he opened his correspondence he slit the tops of the several envelopes that lay by his plate.",
    "\u201cA bill.",
    "Another bill.",
    "It is that I grow extravagant in my old age.",
    "Aha a note from Japp.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes\u201d pricked up my ears.",
    "The Scotland Yard Inspector had more than once introduced us to an interesting case.",
    "\u201cHe merely thanks me in his fashion for a little point in the Aberystwyth Case on which I was able to set him right.",
    "I am delighted to have been of service to him.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow does he thank you\u201d I asked curiously for I knew my Japp.",
    "\u201cHe is kind enough to say that I am a wonderful sport for my age and that he was glad to have had the chance of letting me in on the case.\u201d\n\nThis was so typical of Japp that I could not forbear a chuckle.",
    "Poirot continued to read his correspondence placidly.",
    "\u201cA suggestion that I should give a lecture to our local boy scouts.",
    "The Countess of Forfanock will be obliged if I will call and see her.",
    "Another lapdog without doubt And now for the last.",
    "Ah\u2014\u201d\n\nI looked up quick to notice the change of tone.",
    "Poirot was reading attentively.",
    "In a minute he tossed the sheet over to me.",
    "\u201cThis is out of the ordinary mon ami.",
    "Read for yourself.\u201d\n\nThe letter was written on a foreign type of paper in a bold characteristic hand\n\n\u201cVilla Genevi\u00e8ve\n\nMerlinvillesurMer\n\nFrance\n\n\u201cDear Sir\n\n\u201cI am in need of the services of a detective and for reasons which I will give you later do not wish to call in the official police.",
    "I have heard of you from several quarters and all reports go to show that you are not only a man of decided ability but one who also knows how to be discreet.",
    "I do not wish to trust details to the post but on account of a secret I possess I go in daily fear of my life.",
    "I am convinced that the danger is imminent and therefore I beg that you will lose no time in crossing to France.",
    "I will send a car to meet you at Calais if you will wire me when you are arriving.",
    "I shall be obliged if you will drop all cases you have on hand and devote yourself solely to my interests.",
    "I am prepared to pay any compensation necessary.",
    "I shall probably need your services for a considerable period of time as it may be necessary for you to go out to Santiago where I spent several years of my life.",
    "I shall be content for you to name your own fee.",
    "\u201cAssuring you once more that the matter is urgent\n\n\u201cYours faithfully\n\n\u201cP.",
    "T. RENAULD.\u201d\n\nBelow the signature was a hastily scrawled line almost illegible \u201cFor God\u2019s sake come\u201d\n\nI handed the letter back with quickened pulses.",
    "\u201cAt last\u201d I said.",
    "\u201cHere is something distinctly out of the ordinary.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes indeed\u201d said Poirot meditatively.",
    "\u201cYou will go of course\u201d I continued.",
    "Poirot nodded.",
    "He was thinking deeply.",
    "Finally he seemed to make up his mind and glanced up at the clock.",
    "His face was very grave.",
    "\u201cSee you my friend there is no time to lose.",
    "The Continental express leaves Victoria at 11 o\u2019clock.",
    "Do not agitate yourself.",
    "There is plenty of time.",
    "We can allow ten minutes for discussion.",
    "You accompany me n\u2019estce pas\u201d\n\n\u201cWell\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou told me yourself that your employer needed you not for the next few weeks.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh that\u2019s all right.",
    "But this Mr. Renauld hints strongly that his business is private.\u201d\n\n\u201cTatata.",
    "I will manage M. Renauld.",
    "By the way I seem to know the name\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a wellknown South American millionaire fellow.",
    "His name\u2019s Renauld.",
    "I don\u2019t know whether it could be the same.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut without doubt.",
    "That explains the mention of Santiago.",
    "Santiago is in Chile and Chile it is in South America Ah but we progress finely.\u201d\n\n\u201cDear me Poirot\u201d I said my excitement rising \u201cI smell some goodly shekels in this.",
    "If we succeed we shall make our fortunes\u201d\n\n\u201cDo not be too sure of that my friend.",
    "A rich man and his money are not so easily parted.",
    "Me I have seen a wellknown millionaire turn out a tramful of people to seek for a dropped halfpenny.\u201d\n\nI acknowledged the wisdom of this.",
    "\u201cIn any case\u201d continued Poirot \u201cit is not the money which attracts me here.",
    "Certainly it will be pleasant to have carte blanche in our investigations one can be sure that way of wasting no time but it is something a little bizarre in this problem which arouses my interest.",
    "You remarked the postscript How did it strike you\u201d\n\nI considered.",
    "\u201cClearly he wrote the letter keeping himself well in hand but at the end his selfcontrol snapped and on the impulse of the moment he scrawled those four desperate words.\u201d\n\nBut my friend shook his head energetically.",
    "\u201cYou are in error.",
    "See you not that while the ink of the signature is nearly black that of the postscript is quite pale\u201d\n\n\u201cWell\u201d I said puzzled.",
    "\u201cMon Dieu mon ami but use your little grey cells Is it not obvious M. Renauld wrote his letter.",
    "Without blotting it he reread it carefully.",
    "Then not on impulse but deliberately he added those last words and blotted the sheet.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut why\u201d\n\n\u201cParbleu so that it should produce the effect upon me that it has upon you.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u201d\n\n\u201cMais oui\u2014to make sure of my coming He reread the letter and was dissatisfied.",
    "It was not strong enough\u201d\n\nHe paused and then added softly his eyes shining with that green light that always betokened inward excitement \u201cAnd so mon ami since that postscript was added not on impulse but soberly in cold blood the urgency is very great and we must reach him as soon as possible.\u201d\n\n\u201cMerlinville\u201d I murmured thoughtfully.",
    "\u201cI\u2019ve heard of it I think.\u201d\n\nPoirot nodded.",
    "\u201cIt is a quiet little place\u2014but chic It lies about midway between Bolougne and Calais.",
    "It is rapidly becoming the fashion.",
    "Rich English people who wish to be quiet are taking it up.",
    "M. Renauld has a house in England I suppose\u201d\n\n\u201cYes in Rutland Gate as far as I remember.",
    "Also a big place in the country somewhere in Hertfordshire.",
    "But I really know very little about him he doesn\u2019t do much in a social way.",
    "I believe he has large South American interests in the City and has spent most of his life out in Chile and the Argentino.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell we shall hear all details from the man himself.",
    "Come let us pack.",
    "A small suitcase each and then a taxi to Victoria.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the Countess\u201d I inquired with a smile.",
    "\u201cAh je m\u2019en fiche Her case was certainly not interesting.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy so sure of that\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause in that case she would have come not written.",
    "A woman cannot wait\u2014always remember that Hastings.\u201d\n\nEleven o\u2019clock saw our departure from Victoria on our way to Dover.",
    "Before starting Poirot had despatched a telegram to Mr. Renauld giving the time of our arrival at Calais.",

    "My friend who was anxiously scanning the weather turned a reproachful face upon me.",
    "\u201cIs it that you have forgotten the method most excellent of Laverguier His system I practise it always.",
    "One balances oneself if you remember turning the head from left to right breathing in and out counting six between each breath.\u201d\n\n\u201cH\u2019m\u201d I demurred.",

    "Renauld suggests it in his letter.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe did not know the methods of Hercule Poirot.",
    "I do not run to and fro making journeys and agitating myself.",
    "My work is done from within\u2014here\u2014\u201d he tapped his forehead significantly.",
    "As usual this remark roused my argumentative faculty.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s all very well Poirot but I think you are falling into the habit of despising certain things too much.",
    "A fingerprint has led sometimes to the arrest and conviction of a murderer.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd has without doubt hanged more than one innocent man\u201d remarked Poirot dryly.",
    "\u201cBut surely the study of fingerprints and footprints cigarette ash different kinds of mud and other clues that comprise the minute observation of details\u2014all these are of vital importance\u201d\n\n\u201cBut certainly.",
    "I have never said otherwise.",
    "The trained observer the expert without doubt he is useful But the others the Hercules Poirots they are above the experts To them the experts bring the facts their business is the method of the crime its logical deduction the proper sequence and order of the facts above all the true psychology of the case.",
    "You have hunted the fox yes\u201d\n\n\u201cI have hunted a bit now and again\u201d I said rather bewildered by this abrupt change of subject.",
    "\u201cWhy\u201d\n\n\u201cEh bien this hunting of the fox you need the dogs no\u201d\n\n\u201cHounds\u201d I corrected gently.",
    "\u201cYes of course.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut yet\u201d Poirot wagged his finger at me.",
    "\u201cYou did not descend from your horse and run along the ground smelling with your nose and uttering loud Ow Ows\u201d\n\nIn spite of myself I laughed immoderately.",
    "Poirot nodded in a satisfied manner.",
    "\u201cSo.",
    "You leave the work of the d\u2014 hounds to the hounds.",
    "Yet you demand that I Hercule Poirot should make myself ridiculous by lying down possibly on damp grass to study hypothetical footprints and should scoop up cigarette ash when I do not know one kind from the other.",
    "Remember the Plymouth Express mystery.",
    "The good Japp departed to make a survey of the railway line.",
    "When he returned I without having moved from my apartments was able to tell him exactly what he had found.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo you are of the opinion that Japp wasted his time.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot at all since his evidence confirmed my theory.",
    "But I should have wasted my time if I had gone.",
    "It is the same with so called \u2018experts.\u2019 Remember the handwriting testimony in the Cavendish Case.",
    "One counsel\u2019s questioning brings out testimony as to the resemblances the defence brings evidence to show dissimilarity.",
    "All the language is very technical.",
    "And the result What we all knew in the first place.",
    "The writing was very like that of John Cavendish.",
    "And the psychological mind is faced with the question \u2018Why\u2019 Because it was actually his Or because some one wished us to think it was his I answered that question mon ami and answered it correctly.\u201d\n\nAnd Poirot having effectually silenced if not convinced me leaned back with a satisfied air.",
    "On the boat I knew better than to disturb my friend\u2019s solitude.",
    "The weather was gorgeous and the sea as smooth as the proverbial millpond so I was hardly surprised to hear that Laverguier\u2019s method had once more justified itself when a smiling Poirot joined me on disembarking at Calais.",
    "A disappointment was in store for us as no car had been sent to meet us but Poirot put this down to his telegram having been delayed in transit.",
    "\u201cSince it is carte blanche we will hire a car\u201d he said cheerfully.",
    "And a few minutes later saw us creaking and jolting along in the most ramshackle of automobiles that ever plied for hire in the direction of Merlinville.",
    "My spirits were at their highest.",
    "\u201cWhat gorgeous air\u201d I exclaimed.",

    "Are you not the one and only Hercule Poirot\u201d\n\nBut my little friend did not rise to the bait.",
    "He was observing me gravely.",
    "\u201cYou are what the Scotch people call \u2018fey\u2019 Hastings.",
    "It presages disaster.\u201d\n\n\u201cNonsense.",
    "At any rate you do not share my feelings.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo but I am afraid.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfraid of what\u201d\n\n\u201cI do not know.",
    "But I have a premonition\u2014a je ne sais quoi\u201d\n\nHe spoke so gravely that I was impressed in spite of myself.",
    "\u201cI have a feeling\u201d he said slowly \u201cthat this is going to be a big affair\u2014a long troublesome problem that will not be easy to work out.\u201d\n\nI would have questioned him further but we were just coming into the little town of Merlinville and we slowed up to inquire the way to the Villa Genevi\u00e8ve.",
    "\u201cStraight on monsieur through the town.",
    "The Villa Genevi\u00e8ve is about half a mile the other side.",
    "You cannot miss it.",
    "A big Villa overlooking the sea.\u201d\n\nWe thanked our informant and drove on leaving the town behind.",
    "A fork in the road brought us to a second halt.",
    "A peasant was trudging towards us and we waited for him to come up to us in order to ask the way again.",
    "There was a tiny Villa standing right by the road but it was too small and dilapidated to be the one we wanted.",
    "As we waited the gate of it swung open and a girl came out.",
    "The peasant was passing us now and the driver leaned forward from his seat and asked for direction.",
    "\u201cThe Villa Genevi\u00e8ve Just a few steps up this road to the right monsieur.",
    "You could see it if it were not for the curve.\u201d\n\nThe chauffeur thanked him and started the car again.",
    "My eyes were fascinated by the girl who still stood with one hand on the gate watching us.",
    "I am an admirer of beauty and here was one whom nobody could have passed without remark.",
    "Very tall with the proportions of a young goddess her uncovered golden head gleaming in the sunlight I swore to myself that she was one of the most beautiful girls I had ever seen.",
    "As we swung up the rough road I turned my head to look after her.",
    "\u201cBy Jove Poirot\u201d I exclaimed \u201cdid you see that young goddess.\u201d\n\nPoirot raised his eyebrows.",
    "\u201c\u00c7a commence\u201d he murmured.",
    "\u201cAlready you have seen a goddess\u201d\n\n\u201cBut hang it all wasn\u2019t she\u201d\n\n\u201cPossibly.",
    "I did not remark the fact.\u201d\n\n\u201cSurely you noticed her\u201d\n\n\u201cMon ami two people rarely see the same thing.",
    "You for instance saw a goddess.",
    "I\u2014\u201d he hesitated.",
    "\u201cYes\u201d\n\n\u201cI saw only a girl with anxious eyes\u201d said Poirot gravely.",
    "But at that moment we drew up at a big green gate and simultaneously we both uttered an exclamation.",
    "Before it stood an imposing sergent de ville.",
    "He held up his hand to bar our way.",
    "\u201cYou cannot pass monsieurs.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut we wish to see Mr. Renauld\u201d I cried.",
    "\u201cWe have an appointment.",
    "This is his Villa isn\u2019t it\u201d\n\n\u201cYes monsieur but\u2014\u201d\n\nPoirot leaned forward.",
    "\u201cBut what\u201d\n\n\u201cM.",
    "Renauld was murdered this morning.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\nAt the Villa Genevi\u00e8ve\n\n\nIn a moment Poirot had leapt from the car his eyes blazing with excitement.",
    "He caught the man by the shoulder.",
    "\u201cWhat is that you say Murdered When How\u201d\n\nThe sergent de ville drew himself up.",
    "\u201cI cannot answer any questions monsieur.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrue.",
    "I comprehend.\u201d Poirot reflected for a minute.",
    "\u201cThe Commissary of Police he is without doubt within\u201d\n\n\u201cYes monsieur.\u201d\n\nPoirot took out a card and scribbled a few words on it.",
    "\u201cVoil\u00e0 Will you have the goodness to see that this card is sent in to the commissary at once\u201d\n\nThe man took it and turning his head over his shoulder whistled.",
    "In a few seconds a comrade joined him and was handed Poirot\u2019s message.",
    "There was a wait of some minutes and then a short stout man with a huge moustache came bustling down to the gate.",
    "The sergent de ville saluted and stood aside.",
    "\u201cMy dear M. Poirot\u201d cried the newcomer \u201cI am delighted to see you.",
    "Your arrival is most opportune.\u201d\n\nPoirot\u2019s face had lighted up.",
    "\u201cM.",
    "Bex This is indeed a pleasure.\u201d He turned to me.",
    "\u201cThis is an English friend of mine Captain Hastings\u2014M.",
    "Lucien Bex.\u201d\n\nThe commissary and I bowed to each other ceremoniously then M. Bex turned once more to Poirot.",
    "\u201cMon vieux I have not seen you since 1909 that time in Ostend.",
    "I heard that you had left the Force\u201d\n\n\u201cSo I have.",
    "I run a private business in London.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you say you have information to give which may assist us\u201d\n\n\u201cPossibly you know it already.",
    "You were aware that I had been sent for\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.",
    "By whom\u201d\n\n\u201cThe dead man.",
    "It seems he knew an attempt was going to be made on his life.",
    "Unfortunately he sent for me too late.\u201d\n\n\u201cSacri tonnerre\u201d ejaculated the Frenchman.",
    "\u201cSo he foresaw his own murder That upsets our theories considerably But come inside.\u201d\n\nHe held the gate open and we commenced walking towards the house.",
    "M. Bex continued to talk\n\n\u201cThe examining magistrate M. Hautet must hear of this at once.",
    "He has just finished examining the scene of the crime and is about to begin his interrogations.",
    "A charming man.",
    "You will like him.",
    "Most sympathetic.",
    "Original in his methods but an excellent judge.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen was the crime committed\u201d asked Poirot.",
    "\u201cThe body was discovered this morning about nine o\u2019clock.",
    "Madame Renauld\u2019s evidence and that of the doctors goes to show that the death must have occurred about 2 a.m.",
    "But enter I pray of you.\u201d\n\nWe had arrived at the steps which led up to the front door of the Villa.",
    "In the hall another sergent de ville was sitting.",
    "He rose at sight of the commissary.",
    "\u201cWhere is M. Hautet now\u201d inquired the latter.",
    "\u201cIn the salon monsieur.\u201d\n\nM. Bex opened a door to the left of the hall and we passed in.",
    "M. Hautet and his clerk were sitting at a big round table.",
    "They looked up as we entered.",
    "The commissary introduced us and explained our presence.",
    "M. Hautet the Juge d\u2019Instruction was a tall gaunt man with piercing dark eyes and a neatly cut grey beard which he had a habit of caressing as he talked.",
    "Standing by the mantelpiece was an elderly man with slightly stooping shoulders who was introduced to us as Dr. Durand.",
    "\u201cMost extraordinary\u201d remarked M. Hautet as the commissary finished speaking.",
    "\u201cYou have the letter here monsieur\u201d\n\nPoirot handed it to him and the magistrate read it.",
    "\u201cH\u2019m.",
    "He speaks of a secret.",
    "What a pity he was not more explicit.",
    "We are much indebted to you M. Poirot.",
    "I hope you will do us the honour of assisting us in our investigations.",
    "Or are you obliged to return to London\u201d\n\n\u201cM.",
    "le juge I propose to remain.",
    "I did not arrive in time to prevent my client\u2019s death but I feel myself bound in honour to discover the assassin.\u201d\n\nThe magistrate bowed.",
    "\u201cThese sentiments do you honour.",
    "Also without doubt Madame Renauld will wish to retain your services.",
    "We are expecting M. Giraud from the S\u00fbret\u00e9 in Paris any moment and I am sure that you and he will be able to give each other mutual assistance in your investigations.",
    "In the meantime I hope that you will do me the honour to be present at my interrogations and I need hardly say that if there is any assistance you require it is at your disposal.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thank you monsieur.",
    "You will comprehend that at present I am completely in the dark.",
    "I know nothing whatever.\u201d\n\nM. Hautet nodded to the commissary and the latter took up the tale\n\n\u201cThis morning the old servant Fran\u00e7oise on descending to start her work found the front door ajar.",
    "Feeling a momentary alarm as to burglars she looked into the diningroom but seeing the silver was safe she thought no more about it concluding that her master had without doubt risen early and gone for a stroll.\u201d\n\n\u201cPardon monsieur for interrupting but was that a common practice of his\u201d\n\n\u201cNo it was not but old Fran\u00e7oise has the common idea as regards the English\u2014that they are mad and liable to do the most unaccountable things at any moment Going to call her mistress as usual a younger maid L\u00e9onie was horrified to discover her gagged and bound and almost at the same moment news was brought that M. Renauld\u2019s body had been discovered stone dead stabbed in the back.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is one of the most extraordinary features of the case.",
    "M. Poirot the body was lying face downwards in an open grave.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.",
    "The pit was freshly dug\u2014just a few yards outside the boundary of the Villa grounds.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd he had been dead\u2014how long\u201d\n\nDr. Durand answered this.",
    "\u201cI examined the body this morning at ten o\u2019clock.",
    "Death must have taken place at least seven and possibly ten hours previously.\u201d\n\n\u201cH\u2019m that fixes it at between midnight and 3 a.m.\u201d\n\n\u201cExactly and Madame Renauld\u2019s evidence places it at after 2 a.m. which narrows the field still further.",
    "Death must have been instantaneous and naturally could not have been selfinflicted.\u201d\n\nPoirot nodded and the commissary resumed\n\n\u201cMadame Renauld was hastily freed from the cords that bound her by the horrified servants.",
    "She was in a terrible condition of weakness almost unconscious from the pain of her bonds.",
    "It appears that two masked men entered the bedroom gagged and bound her whilst forcibly abducting her husband.",
    "This we know at second hand from the servants.",
    "On hearing the tragic news she fell at once into an alarming state of agitation.",
    "On arrival Dr. Durand immediately prescribed a sedative and we have not yet been able to question her.",
    "But without doubt she will awake more calm and be equal to bearing the strain of the interrogation.\u201d\n\nThe commissary paused.",
    "\u201cAnd the inmates of the house monsieur\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is old Fran\u00e7oise the housekeeper she lived for many years with the former owners of the Villa Genevi\u00e8ve.",
    "Then there are two young girls sisters Denise and L\u00e9onie Oulard.",
    "Their home is in Merlinville and they come of the most respectable parents.",
    "Then there is the chauffeur whom M. Renauld brought over from England with him but he is away on a holiday.",
    "Finally there are Madame Renauld and her son M. Jack Renauld.",
    "He too is away from home at present.\u201d\n\nPoirot bowed his head.",
    "M. Hautet spoke\n\n\u201cMarchaud\u201d\n\nThe sergent de ville appeared.",
    "\u201cBring in the woman Fran\u00e7oise.\u201d\n\nThe man saluted and disappeared.",
    "In a moment or two he returned escorting the frightened Fran\u00e7oise.",
    "\u201cYou name is Fran\u00e7oise Arrichet\u201d\n\n\u201cYes monsieur.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have been a long time in service at the Villa Genevi\u00e8ve\u201d\n\n\u201cEleven years with Madame la Vicomtesse.",
    "Then when she sold the Villa this spring I consented to remain on with the English milor.",
    "Never did I imagine\u2014\u201d\n\nThe magistrate cut her short.",
    "\u201cWithout doubt without doubt.",
    "Now Fran\u00e7oise in this matter of the front door whose business was it to fasten it at night\u201d\n\n\u201cMine monsieur.",
    "Always I saw to it myself.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd last night\u201d\n\n\u201cI fastened it as usual.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are sure of that\u201d\n\n\u201cI swear it by the blessed saints monsieur.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat time would that be\u201d\n\n\u201cThe same time as usual halfpast ten monsieur.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat about the rest of the household had they gone up to bed\u201d\n\n\u201cMadame had retired some time before.",
    "Denise and L\u00e9onie went up with me.",
    "Monsieur was still in his study.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen if any one unfastened the door afterwards it must have been M. Renauld himself\u201d\n\nFran\u00e7oise shrugged her broad shoulders.",
    "\u201cWhat should he do that for With robbers and assassins passing every minute A nice idea Monsieur was not an imbecile.",
    "It is not as though he had had to let cette dame out\u2014\u201d\n\nThe magistrate interrupted sharply\n\n\u201cCette dame What lady do you mean\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy the lady who came to see him.\u201d\n\n\u201cHad a lady been to see him that evening\u201d\n\n\u201cBut yes monsieur\u2014and many other evenings as well.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho was she Did you know her\u201d\n\nA rather cunning look spread over the woman\u2019s face.",
    "\u201cHow should I know who it was\u201d she grumbled.",
    "\u201cI did not let her in last night.\u201d\n\n\u201cAha\u201d roared the examining magistrate bringing his hand down with a bang on the table.",
    "\u201cYou would trifle with the police would you I demand that you tell me at once the name of this woman who came to visit M. Renauld in the evenings.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe police\u2014the police\u201d grumbled Fran\u00e7oise.",
    "\u201cNever did I think that I should be mixed up with the police.",
    "But I know well enough who she was.",
    "It was Madame Daubreuil.\u201d\n\nThe commissary uttered an exclamation and leaned forward as though in utter astonishment.",
    "\u201cMadame Daubreuil\u2014from the Villa Marguerite just down the road\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is what I said monsieur.",
    "Oh she is a pretty one cellela\u201d The old woman tossed her head scornfully.",
    "\u201cMadame Daubreuil\u201d murmured the commissary.",
    "\u201cImpossible.\u201d\n\n\u201cVoil\u00e0\u201d grumbled Fran\u00e7oise.",
    "\u201cThat is all you get for telling the truth.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot at all\u201d said the examining magistrate soothingly.",
    "\u201cWe were surprised that is all.",
    "Madame Daubreuil then and Monsieur Renauld they were\u2014\u201d he paused delicately.",
    "\u201cEh It was that without doubt\u201d\n\n\u201cHow should I know But what will you Monsieur he was milor anglais\u2014tr\u00e9s riche\u2014and Madame Daubreuil she was poor that one\u2014and tr\u00e9s chic for all that she lives so quietly with her daughter.",
    "Not a doubt of it she has had her history She is no longer young but ma foi I who speak to you have seen the men\u2019s heads turn after her as she goes down the street.",
    "Besides lately she has had more money to spend\u2014all the town knows it.",
    "The little economies they are at an end.\u201d And Fran\u00e7oise shook her head with an air of unalterable certainty.",
    "M. Hautet stroked his beard reflectively.",
    "\u201cAnd Madame Renauld\u201d he asked at length.",
    "\u201cHow did she take this\u2014friendship.\u201d\n\nFran\u00e7oise shrugged her shoulders.",
    "\u201cShe was always most amiable\u2014most polite.",
    "One would say that she suspected nothing.",
    "But all the same is it not so the heart suffers monsieur Day by day I have watched Madame grow paler and thinner.",
    "She was not the same woman who arrived here a month ago.",
    "Monsieur too has changed.",
    "He also has had his worries.",
    "One could see that he was on the brink of a crisis of the nerves.",
    "And who could wonder with an affair conducted such a fashion No reticence no discretion.",
    "Style anglais without doubt\u201d\n\nI bounded indignantly in my seat but the examining magistrate was continuing his questions undistracted by side issues.",
    "\u201cYou say that M. Renauld had not to let Madame Daubreuil out Had she left then\u201d\n\n\u201cYes monsieur.",
    "I heard them come out of the study and go to the door.",
    "Monsieur said good night and shut the door after her.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat time was that\u201d\n\n\u201cAbout twentyfive minutes after ten monsieur.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you know when M. Renauld went to bed\u201d\n\n\u201cI heard him come up about ten minutes after we did.",
    "The stair creaks so that one hears every one who goes up and down.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd that is all You heard no sound of disturbance during the night\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing whatever monsieur.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhich of the servants came down the first in the morning\u201d\n\n\u201cI did monsieur.",
    "At once I saw the door swinging open.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat about the other downstairs windows were they all fastened\u201d\n\n\u201cEvery one of them.",
    "There was nothing suspicious or out of place anywhere.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood Fran\u00e7oise you can go.\u201d\n\nThe old woman shuffled towards the door.",
    "On the threshold she looked back.",
    "\u201cI will tell you one thing monsieur.",
    "That Madame Daubreuil she is a bad one Oh yes one woman knows about another.",
    "She is a bad one remember that.\u201d And shaking her head sagely Fran\u00e7oise left the room.",
    "\u201cL\u00e9onie Oulard\u201d called the magistrate.",
    "L\u00e9onie appeared dissolved in tears and inclined to be hysterical.",
    "M. Hautet dealt with her adroitly.",
    "Her evidence was mainly concerned with the discovery of her mistress gagged and bound of which she gave rather an exaggerated account.",
    "She like Fran\u00e7oise had heard nothing during the night.",
    "Her sister Denise succeeded her.",
    "She agreed that her master had changed greatly of late.",
    "\u201cEvery day he became more and more morose.",
    "He ate less.",
    "He was always depressed.\u201d But Denise had her own theory.",
    "\u201cWithout doubt it was the Mafia he had on his track Two masked men\u2014who else could it be A terrible society that\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is of course possible\u201d said the magistrate smoothly.",
    "\u201cNow my girl was it you who admitted Madame Daubreuil to the house last night\u201d\n\n\u201cNot last night monsieur the night before.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut Fran\u00e7oise has just told us that Madame Daubreuil was here last night\u201d\n\n\u201cNo monsieur.",
    "A lady did come to see M. Renauld last night but it was not Madame Daubreuil.\u201d\n\nSurprised the magistrate insisted but the girl held firm.",
    "She knew Madame Daubreuil perfectly by sight.",
    "This lady was dark also but shorter and much younger.",
    "Nothing could shake her statement.",
    "\u201cHad you ever seen this lady before\u201d\n\n\u201cNever monsieur.\u201d And then the girl added diffidently \u201cBut I think she was English.\u201d\n\n\u201cEnglish\u201d\n\n\u201cYes monsieur.",
    "She asked for M. Renauld in quite good French but the accent\u2014one can always tell it n\u2019estce pas Besides when they came out of the study they were speaking in English.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you hear what they said Could you understand it I mean\u201d\n\n\u201cMe I speak the English very well\u201d said Denise with pride.",
    "\u201cThe lady was speaking too fast for me to catch what she said but I heard Monsieur\u2019s last words as he opened the door for her.\u201d She paused and then repeated carefully and laboriously\n\n\u201c\u200a\u2018Yeas\u2014yeas\u2014butt for Gaud\u2019s saike go nauw\u2019\u200a\u201d\n\n\u201cYes yes but for God\u2019s sake go now\u201d repeated the magistrate.",
    "He dismissed Denise and after a moment or two for consideration recalled Fran\u00e7oise.",
    "To her he propounded the question as to whether she had not made a mistake in fixing the night of Madame Daubreuil\u2019s visit.",
    "Fran\u00e7oise however proved unexpectedly obstinate.",
    "It was last night that Madame Daubreuil had come.",
    "Without a doubt it was she.",
    "Denise wished to make herself interesting voil\u00e0 tout So she had cooked up this fine tale about a strange lady.",
    "Airing her knowledge of English too Probably Monsieur had never spoken that sentence in English at all and even if he had it proved nothing for Madame Daubreuil spoke English perfectly and generally used that language when talking to M. and Madame Renauld.",
    "\u201cYou see M. Jack the son of Monsieur was usually here and he spoke the French very badly.\u201d\n\nThe magistrate did not insist.",
    "Instead he inquired about the chauffeur and learned that only yesterday M. Renauld had declared that he was not likely to use the car and that Masters might just as well take a holiday.",
    "A perplexed frown was beginning to gather between Poirot\u2019s eyes.",
    "\u201cWhat is it\u201d I whispered.",
    "He shook his head impatiently and asked a question\n\n\u201cPardon M. Bex but without doubt M. Renauld could drive the car himself\u201d\n\nThe commissary looked over at Fran\u00e7oise and the old woman replied promptly\n\n\u201cNo Monsieur did not drive himself.\u201d\n\nPoirot\u2019s frown deepened.",
    "\u201cI wish you would tell me what is worrying you\u201d I said impatiently.",
    "\u201cSee you not In his letter M. Renauld speaks of sending the car for me to Calais.\u201d\n\n\u201cPerhaps he meant a hired car\u201d I suggested.",
    "\u201cDoubtless that is so.",
    "But why hire a car when you have one of your own.",
    "Why choose yesterday to send away the chauffeur on a holiday\u2014suddenly at a moment\u2019s notice Was it that for some reason he wanted him out of the way before we arrived\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n4\n\nThe Letter Signed \u201cBella\u201d\n\n\nFran\u00e7oise had left the room.",
    "The magistrate was drumming thoughtfully on the table.",
    "\u201cM.",
    "Bex\u201d he said at length \u201chere we have directly conflicting testimony.",
    "Which are we to believe Fran\u00e7oise or Denise\u201d\n\n\u201cDenise\u201d said the commissary decidedly.",
    "\u201cIt was she who let the visitor in.",
    "Fran\u00e7oise is old and obstinate and has evidently taken a dislike to Madame Daubreuil.",
    "Besides our own knowledge tends to show that Renauld was entangled with another woman.\u201d\n\n\u201cTiens\u201d cried M. Hautet.",
    "\u201cWe have forgotten to inform M. Poirot of that.\u201d He searched amongst the papers on the table and finally handed the one he was in search of to my friend.",
    "\u201cThis letter M. Poirot we found in the pocket of the dead man\u2019s overcoat.\u201d\n\nPoirot took it and unfolded it.",
    "It was somewhat worn and crumbled and was written in English in a rather unformed hand\n\n\u201cMy dearest one\u201d\n\nWhy have you not written for so long You do love me still don\u2019t you Your letters lately have been so different cold and strange and now this long silence.",
    "It makes me afraid.",
    "If you were to stop loving me But that\u2019s impossible\u2014what a silly kid I am\u2014always imagining things But if you did stop loving me I don\u2019t know what I should do\u2014kill myself perhaps I couldn\u2019t live without you.",
    "Sometimes I fancy another woman is coming between us.",
    "Let her look out that\u2019s all\u2014and you too I\u2019d as soon kill you as let her have you I mean it.",
    "\u201cBut there I\u2019m writing highflown nonsense.",
    "You love me and I love you\u2014yes love you love you love you\n\n\u201cYour own adoring\n\n\u201cBELLA.\u201d\n\nThere was no address or date.",
    "Poirot handed it back with a grave face.",
    "\u201cAnd the assumption is M. le juge\u2014\u201d\n\nThe examining magistrate shrugged his shoulders.",
    "\u201cObviously M. Renauld was entangled with this Englishwoman\u2014Bella.",
    "He comes over here meets Madame Daubreuil and starts an intrigue with her.",
    "He cools off to the other and she instantly suspects something.",
    "This letter contains a distinct threat.",
    "M. Poirot at first sight the case seemed simplicity itself.",
    "Jealousy The fact that M. Renauld was stabbed in the back seemed to point distinctly to its being a woman\u2019s crime.\u201d\n\nPoirot nodded.",
    "\u201cThe stab in the back yes\u2014but not the grave That was laborious work hard work\u2014no woman dug that grave monsieur.",
    "That was a man\u2019s doing.\u201d\n\nThe commissary exclaimed excitedly \u201cYes yes you are right.",
    "We did not think of that.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs I said\u201d continued M. Hautet \u201cat first sight the case seemed simple but the masked men and the letter you received from M. Renauld complicate matters.",
    "Here we seem to have an entirely different set of circumstances with no relationship between the two.",
    "As regards the letter written to yourself do you think it is possible that it referred in any way to this \u2018Bella\u2019 and her threats\u201d\n\nPoirot shook his head.",
    "\u201cHardly.",
    "A man like M. Renauld who has led an adventurous life in outoftheway places would not be likely to ask for protection against a woman.\u201d\n\nThe examining magistrate nodded his head emphatically.",
    "\u201cMy view exactly.",
    "Then we must look for the explanation of the letter\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIn Santiago\u201d finished the commissary.",
    "\u201cI shall cable without delay to the police in that city requesting full details of the murdered man\u2019s life out there his love affairs his business transactions his friendships and any enmities he may have incurred.",
    "It will be strange if after that we do not hold a clue to his mysterious murder.\u201d\n\nThe commissary looked round for approval.",
    "\u201cExcellent\u201d said Poirot appreciatively.",
    "\u201cHis wife too may be able to give us a pointer\u201d added the magistrate.",
    "\u201cYou have found no other letters from this Bella amongst M. Renauld\u2019s effects\u201d asked Poirot.",
    "\u201cNo.",
    "Of course one of our first proceedings was to search through his private papers in the study.",
    "We found nothing of interest however.",
    "All seemed square and aboveboard.",
    "The only thing at all out of the ordinary was his will.",
    "Here it is.\u201d\n\nPoirot ran through the document.",
    "\u201cSo.",
    "A legacy of a thousand pounds to Mr. Stonor\u2014who is he by the way\u201d\n\n\u201cM.",
    "Renauld\u2019s secretary.",
    "He remained in England but was over here once or twice for a weekend.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd everything else left unconditionally to his beloved wife Eloise.",
    "Simply drawn up but perfectly legal.",
    "Witnessed by the two servants Denise and Fran\u00e7oise.",
    "Nothing so very unusual about that.\u201d He handed it back.",
    "\u201cPerhaps\u201d began Bex \u201cyou did not notice\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThe date\u201d twinkled Poirot.",
    "\u201cBut yes I noticed it.",
    "A fortnight ago.",
    "Possibly it marks his first intimation of danger.",
    "Many rich men die intestate through never considering the likelihood of their demise.",
    "But it is dangerous to draw conclusions prematurely.",
    "It points however to his having a real liking and fondness for his wife in spite of his amorous intrigues.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes\u201d said M. Hautet doubtfully.",
    "\u201cBut it is possibly a little unfair on his son since it leaves him entirely dependent on his mother.",
    "If she were to marry again and her second husband obtained an ascendancy over her this boy might never touch a penny of his father\u2019s money.\u201d\n\nPoirot shrugged his shoulders.",
    "\u201cMan is a vain animal.",
    "M. Renauld figured to himself without doubt that his widow would never marry again.",
    "As to the son it may have been a wise precaution to leave the money in his mother\u2019s hands.",
    "The sons of rich men are proverbially wild.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt may be as you say.",
    "Now M. Poirot you would without doubt like to visit the scene of the crime.",
    "I am sorry that the body has been removed but of course photographs have been taken from every conceivable angle and will be at your disposal as soon as they are available.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thank you monsieur for all your courtesy.\u201d\n\nThe commissary rose.",
    "\u201cCome with me monsieurs.\u201d\n\nHe opened the door and bowed ceremoniously to Poirot to precede him.",
    "Poirot with equal politeness drew back and bowed to the commissary.",
    "\u201cMonsieur.\u201d\n\n\u201cMonsieur.\u201d\n\nAt last they got out into the hall.",
    "\u201cThat room there it is the study hein\u201d asked Poirot suddenly nodding towards the door opposite.",
    "\u201cYes.",
    "You would like to see it\u201d He threw the door open as he spoke and we entered.",
    "The room which M. Renauld had chosen for his own particular use was small but furnished with great taste and comfort.",
    "A businesslike writing desk with many pigeon holes stood in the window.",
    "Two large leathercovered armchairs faced the fireplace and between them was a round table covered with the latest books and magazines.",
    "Bookshelves lined two of the walls and at the end of the room opposite the window there was a handsome oak sideboard with a tantalus on top.",
    "The curtains and porti\u00e8re were of a soft dull green and the carpet matched them in tone.",
    "Poirot stood a moment talking in the room then he stepped forward passed his hand lightly over the backs of the leather chairs picked up a magazine from the table and drew a finger gingerly over the surface of the oak sideboard.",
    "His face expressed complete approval.",
    "\u201cNo dust\u201d I asked with a smile.",
    "He beamed on me appreciative of my knowledge of his peculiarities.",
    "\u201cNot a particle mon ami And for once perhaps it is a pity.\u201d\n\nHis sharp birdlike eyes darted here and there.",
    "\u201cAh\u201d he remarked suddenly with an intonation of relief.",
    "\u201cThe hearthrug is crooked\u201d and he bent down to straighten it.",
    "Suddenly he uttered an exclamation and rose.",
    "In his hand he held a small fragment of paper.",
    "\u201cIn France as in England\u201d he remarked \u201cthe domestics omit to sweep under the mats\u201d\n\nBex took the fragment from him and I came closer to examine it.",
    "\u201cYou recognize it\u2014eh Hastings\u201d\n\nI shook my head puzzled\u2014and yet that particular shade of pink paper was very familiar.",
    "The commissary\u2019s mental processes were quicker than mine.",
    "\u201cA fragment of a cheque\u201d he exclaimed.",
    "The piece of paper was roughly about two inches square.",
    "On it was written in ink the word \u201cDuveen.\u201d\n\n\u201cBien\u201d said Bex.",
    "\u201cThis cheque was payable to or drawn by one named Duveen.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe former I fancy\u201d said Poirot \u201cfor if I am not mistaken the handwriting is that of M. Renauld.\u201d\n\nThat was soon established by comparing it with a memorandum from the desk.",
    "\u201cDear me\u201d murmured the commissary with a crestfallen air \u201cI really cannot imagine how I came to overlook this.\u201d\n\nPoirot laughed.",
    "\u201cThe moral of that is always look under the mats My friend Hastings here will tell you that anything in the least crooked is a torment to me.",
    "As soon as I saw that the hearthrug was out of the straight I said to myself \u2018Tiens The leg of the chair caught it in being pushed back.",
    "Possibly there may be something beneath it which the good Fran\u00e7oise overlooked.\u2019\u200a\u201d\n\n\u201cFran\u00e7oise\u201d\n\n\u201cOr Denise or L\u00e9onie.",
    "Whoever did this room.",
    "Since there is no dust the room must have been done this morning.",
    "I reconstruct the incident like this.",
    "Yesterday possibly last night M. Renauld drew a cheque to the order of some one named Duveen.",
    "Afterwards it was torn up and scattered on the floor.",
    "This morning\u2014\u201d But M. Bex was already pulling impatiently at the bell.",
    "Fran\u00e7oise answered it.",
    "Yes there had been a lot of pieces of paper on the floor.",
    "What had she done with them Put them in the kitchen stove of course What else\n\nWith a gesture of despair Bex dismissed her.",
    "Then his face lightening he ran to the desk.",
    "In a minute he was hunting through the dead man\u2019s cheque book.",
    "Then he repeated his former gesture.",
    "The last counterfoil was blank.",
    "\u201cCourage\u201d cried Poirot clapping him on the back.",
    "\u201cWithout doubt Madame Renauld will be able to tell us all about this mysterious person named Duveen.\u201d\n\nThe commissary\u2019s face cleared.",
    "\u201cThat is true.",
    "Let us proceed.\u201d\n\nAs we turned to leave the room Poirot remarked casually \u201cIt was here that M. Renauld received his guest last night eh\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was\u2014but how did you know\u201d\n\n\u201cBy this.",
    "I found it on the back of the leather chair.\u201d\n\nAnd he held up between his finger and thumb a long black hair\u2014a woman\u2019s hair\n\nM. Bex took us out by the back of the house to where there was a small shed leaning against the house.",
    "He produced a key from his pocket and unlocked it.",
    "\u201cThe body is here.",
    "We moved it from the scene of the crime just before you arrived as the photographers had done with it.\u201d\n\nHe opened the door and we passed in.",
    "The murdered man lay on the ground with a sheet over him.",
    "M. Bex dexterously whipped off the covering.",
    "Renauld was a man of medium height slender and lithe in figure.",
    "He looked about fifty years of age and his dark hair was plentifully streaked with grey.",
    "He was clean shaven with a long thin nose and eyes set rather close together and his skin was deeply bronzed as that of a man who had spent most of his life beneath tropical skies.",
    "His lips were drawn back from his teeth and an expression of absolute amazement and terror was stamped on the livid features.",
    "\u201cOne can see by his face that he was stabbed in the back\u201d remarked Poirot.",
    "Very gently he turned the dead man over.",
    "There between the shoulderblades staining the light fawn overcoat was a round dark patch.",
    "In the middle of it there was a slit in the cloth.",
    "Poirot examined it narrowly.",
    "\u201cHave you any idea with what weapon the crime was committed\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was left in the wound.\u201d The commissary reached down a large glass jar.",
    "In it was a small object that looked to me more like a paperknife than anything else.",
    "It had a black handle and a narrow shining blade.",
    "The whole thing was not more than ten inches long.",
    "Poirot tested the discoloured point gingerly with his finger tip.",
    "\u201cMa foi but it is sharp A nice easy little tool for murder\u201d\n\n\u201cUnfortunately we could find no trace of fingerprints on it\u201d remarked Bex regretfully.",
    "\u201cThe murderer must have worn gloves.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course he did\u201d said Poirot contemptuously.",
    "\u201cEven in Santiago they know enough for that.",
    "The veriest amateur of an English Mees knows it\u2014thanks to the publicity the Bertillon system has been given in the Press.",
    "All the same it interests me very much that there were no fingerprints.",
    "It is so amazingly simple to leave the fingerprints of some one else And then the police are happy.\u201d He shook his head.",
    "\u201cI very much fear our criminal is not a man of method\u2014either that or he was pressed for time.",
    "But we shall see.\u201d\n\nHe let the body fall back into its original position.",
    "\u201cHe wore only underclothes under his overcoat I see\u201d he remarked.",
    "\u201cYes the examining magistrate thinks that is rather a curious point.\u201d\n\nAt this minute there was a tap on the door which Bex had closed after him.",
    "He strode forward and opened it.",
    "Fran\u00e7oise was there.",
    "She endeavoured to peep in with ghoulish curiosity.",
    "\u201cWell what is it\u201d demanded Bex impatiently.",
    "\u201cMadame.",
    "She sends a message that she is much recovered and is quite ready to receive the examining magistrate.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood\u201d said M. Bex briskly.",
    "\u201cTell M. Hautet and say that we will come at once.\u201d\n\nPoirot lingered a moment looking back towards the body.",
    "I thought for a moment that he was going to apostrophize it to declare aloud his determination never to rest till he had discovered the murderer.",
    "But when he spoke it was tamely and awkwardly and his comment was ludicrously inappropriate to the solemnity of the moment.",
    "\u201cHe wore his overcoat very long\u201d he said constrainedly.",
    "5\n\nMrs. Renauld\u2019s Story\n\n\nWe found M. Hautet awaiting us in the hall and we all proceeded upstairs together Fran\u00e7oise marching ahead to show us the way.",
    "Poirot went up in a zigzag fashion which puzzled me until he whispered with a grimace\n\n\u201cNo wonder the servants heard M. Renauld mounting the stairs not a board of them but creaks fit to wake the dead\u201d\n\nAt the head of the staircase a small passage branched off.",
    "\u201cThe servants\u2019 quarters\u201d explained Bex.",
    "We continued along a corridor and Fran\u00e7oise tapped on the last door to the right of it.",
    "A faint voice bade us enter and we passed into a large sunny apartment looking out towards the sea which showed blue and sparkling about a quarter of a mile distant.",
    "On a couch propped up with cushions and attended by Dr. Durand lay a tall strikinglooking woman.",
    "She was middleaged and her once dark hair was now almost entirely silvered but the intense vitality and strength of her personality would have made itself felt anywhere.",
    "You knew at once that you were in the presence of what the French call \u201cune maitresse femme.\u201d\n\nShe greeted us with a dignified inclination of the head.",
    "\u201cPray be seated monsieurs.\u201d\n\nWe took chairs and the magistrate\u2019s clerk established himself at a round table.",
    "\u201cI hope madame\u201d began M. Hautet \u201cthat it will not distress you unduly to relate to us what occurred last night\u201d\n\n\u201cNot at all monsieur.",
    "I know the value of time if these scoundrelly assassins are to be caught and punished.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery well madame.",
    "It will fatigue you less I think if I ask you questions and you confine yourself to answering them.",
    "At what time did you go to bed last night\u201d\n\n\u201cAt halfpast nine monsieur.",
    "I was tired.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd your husband\u201d\n\n\u201cAbout an hour later I fancy.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid he seem disturbed\u2014upset in any way\u201d\n\n\u201cNo not more than usual.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat happened then\u201d\n\n\u201cWe slept.",
    "I was awakened by a hand being pressed over my mouth.",
    "I tried to scream out but the hand prevented me.",
    "There were two men in the room.",
    "They were both masked.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan you describe them at all madame\u201d\n\n\u201cOne was very tall and had a long black beard the other was short and stout.",
    "His beard was reddish.",
    "They both wore hats pulled down over their eyes.\u201d\n\n\u201cH\u2019m\u201d said the magistrate thoughtfully \u201ctoo much beard I fear.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou mean they were false\u201d\n\n\u201cYes madame.",
    "But continue your story.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was the short man who was holding me.",
    "He forced a gag into my mouth and then bound me with rope hand and foot.",
    "The other man was standing over my husband.",
    "He had caught up my little dagger paperknife from the dressingtable and was holding it with the point just over his heart.",
    "When the short man had finished with me he joined the other and they forced my husband to get up and accompany them into the dressingroom next door.",
    "I was nearly fainting with terror nevertheless I listened desperately.",
    "\u201cThey were speaking in too low a tone for me to hear what they said.",
    "But I recognized the language a bastard Spanish such as is spoken in some parts of South America.",
    "They seemed to be demanding something from my husband and presently they grew angry and their voices rose a little.",
    "I think the tall man was speaking.",
    "\u2018You know what we want\u2019 he said.",
    "\u2018The secret Where is it\u2019 I do not know what my husband answered but the other replied fiercely \u2018You lie We know you have it.",
    "Where are your keys\u2019\n\n\u201cThen I heard sounds of drawers being pulled out.",
    "There is a safe on the wall of my husband\u2019s dressingroom in which he always keeps a fairly large amount of ready money.",
    "L\u00e9onie tells me this has been rifled and the money taken but evidently what they were looking for was not there for presently I heard the tall man with an oath command my husband to dress himself.",
    "Soon after that I think some noise in the house must have disturbed them for they hustled my husband out into my room only half dressed.\u201d\n\n\u201cPardon\u201d interrupted Poirot \u201cbut is there then no other egress from the dressingroom\u201d\n\n\u201cNo monsieur there is only the communicating door into my room.",
    "They hurried my husband through the short man in front and the tall man behind him with the dagger still in his hand.",
    "Paul tried to break away to come to me.",
    "I saw his agonized eyes.",
    "He turned to his captors.",
    "\u2018I must speak to her\u2019 he said.",
    "Then coming to the side of the bed \u2018It is all right Eloise\u2019 he said.",
    "\u2018Do not be afraid.",
    "I shall return before morning.\u2019 But although he tried to make his voice confident I could see the terror in his eyes.",
    "Then they hustled him out of the door the tall man saying \u2018One sound\u2014and you are a dead man remember.\u2019\n\n\u201cAfter that\u201d continued Mrs. Renauld \u201cI must have fainted.",
    "The next thing I recollect is L\u00e9onie rubbing my wrists and giving me brandy.\u201d\n\n\u201cMadame Renauld\u201d said the magistrate \u201chad you any idea what it was for which the assassins were searching\u201d\n\n\u201cNone whatever monsieur.\u201d\n\n\u201cHad you any knowledge that your husband feared something\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.",
    "I had seen the change in him.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow long ago was that\u201d\n\nMrs. Renauld reflected.",
    "\u201cTen days perhaps.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot longer\u201d\n\n\u201cPossibly.",
    "I only noticed it then.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you question your husband at all as to the cause\u201d\n\n\u201cOnce.",
    "He put me off evasively.",
    "Nevertheless I was convinced that he was suffering some terrible anxiety.",
    "However since he evidently wished to conceal the fact from me I tried to pretend that I had noticed nothing.\u201d\n\n\u201cWere you aware that he had called in the services of a detective\u201d\n\n\u201cA detective\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Renauld very much surprised.",
    "\u201cYes this gentleman\u2014M.",
    "Hercule Poirot.\u201d Poirot bowed.",
    "\u201cHe arrived today in response to a summons from your husband.\u201d And taking the letter written by M. Renauld from his pocket he handed it to the lady.",
    "She read it with apparently genuine astonishment.",
    "\u201cI had no idea of this.",
    "Evidently he was fully cognizant of the danger.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow madame I will beg of you to be frank with me.",
    "Is there any incident in your husband\u2019s past life in South America which might throw light on his murder\u201d\n\nMrs. Renauld reflected deeply but at last shook her head.",
    "\u201cI can think of none.",
    "Certainly my husband had many enemies people he had got the better of in some way or another but I can think of no one distinctive case.",
    "I do not say there is no such incident\u2014only that I am not aware of it.\u201d\n\nThe examining magistrate stroked his beard disconsolately.",
    "\u201cAnd you can fix the time of this outrage\u201d\n\n\u201cYes I distinctly remember hearing the clock on the mantelpiece strike two.\u201d She nodded towards an eightday travelling clock in a leather case which stood in the centre of the chimneypiece.",
    "Poirot rose from his seat scrutinized the clock carefully and nodded satisfied.",
    "\u201cAnd here too\u201d exclaimed M. Bex \u201cis a wrist watch knocked off the dressingtable by the assassins without doubt and smashed to atoms.",
    "Little did they know it would testify against them.\u201d\n\nGently he picked away the fragments of broken glass.",
    "Suddenly his face changed to one of utter stupefaction.",
    "\u201cMon Dieu\u201d he ejaculated.",
    "\u201cWhat is it\u201d\n\n\u201cThe hands of the watch point to seven o\u2019clock\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u201d cried the examining magistrate astonished.",
    "But Poirot deft as ever took the broken trinket from the startled commissary and held it to his ear.",
    "Then he smiled.",
    "\u201cThe glass is broken yes but the watch itself is still going.\u201d\n\nThe explanation of the mystery was greeted with a relieved smile.",
    "But the magistrate bethought him of another point.",
    "\u201cBut surely it is not seven o\u2019clock now\u201d\n\n\u201cNo\u201d said Poirot gently \u201cit is a few minutes after five.",
    "Possibly the watch gains is that so madame\u201d\n\nMrs. Renauld was frowning perplexedly.",
    "\u201cIt does gain\u201d she admitted \u201cbut I\u2019ve never known it to gain quite so much as that.\u201d\n\nWith a gesture of impatience the magistrate left the matter of the watch and proceeded with his interrogatory.",
    "\u201cMadame the front door was found ajar.",
    "It seems almost certain that the murderers entered that way yet it has not been forced at all.",
    "Can you suggest any explanation\u201d\n\n\u201cPossibly my husband went out for a stroll the last thing and forgot to latch it when he came in.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs that a likely thing to happen\u201d\n\n\u201cVery.",
    "My husband was the most absentminded of men.\u201d\n\nThere was a slight frown on her brow as she spoke as though this trait in the dead man\u2019s character had at times vexed her.",
    "\u201cThere is one inference I think we might draw\u201d remarked the commissary suddenly.",
    "\u201cSince the men insisted on M. Renauld dressing himself it looks as though the place they were taking him to the place where \u2018the secret\u2019 was concealed lay some distance away.\u201d\n\nThe magistrate nodded.",
    "\u201cYes far and yet not too far since he spoke of being back by morning.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat times does the last train leave the station of Merlinville\u201d asked Poirot.",
    "\u201cElevenfifty one way and 1217 the other but it is more probable that they had a motor waiting.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course\u201d agreed Poirot looking somewhat crestfallen.",
    "\u201cIndeed that might be one way of tracing them\u201d continued the magistrate brightening.",
    "\u201cA motor containing two foreigners is quite likely to have been noticed.",
    "That is an excellent point M. Bex.\u201d\n\nHe smiled to himself and then becoming grave once more he said to Mrs. Renauld\n\n\u201cThere is another question.",
    "Do you know any one of the name of \u2018Duveen\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cDuveen\u201d Mrs. Renauld repeated thoughtfully.",
    "\u201cNo for the moment I cannot say I do.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have never heard your husband mention any one of that name\u201d\n\n\u201cNever.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you know any one whose Christian name is Bella\u201d\n\nHe watched Mrs. Renauld narrowly as he spoke seeking to surprise any signs of anger or consciousness but she merely shook her head in quite a natural manner.",
    "He continued his questions.",
    "\u201cAre you aware that your husband had a visitor last night\u201d\n\nNow he saw the red mount slightly in her cheeks but she replied composedly.",
    "\u201cNo who was that\u201d\n\n\u201cA lady.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed\u201d\n\nBut for the moment the magistrate was content to say no more.",
    "It seemed unlikely that Madame Daubreuil had any connection with the crime and he was anxious not to upset Mrs. Renauld more than necessary.",
    "He made a sign to the commissary and the latter replied with a nod.",
    "Then rising he went across the room and returned with the glass jar we had seen in the outhouse in his hand.",
    "From this he took the dagger.",
    "\u201cMadame\u201d he said gently \u201cdo you recognize this\u201d\n\nShe gave a little cry.",
    "\u201cYes that is my little dagger.\u201d Then\u2014she saw the stained point and she drew back her eyes widening with horror.",
    "\u201cIs that\u2014blood\u201d\n\n\u201cYes madame.",
    "Your husband was killed with this weapon.\u201d He removed it hastily from sight.",
    "\u201cYou are quite sure about it\u2019s being the one that was on your dressingtable last night\u201d\n\n\u201cOh yes.",
    "It was a present from my son.",
    "He was in the Air Force during the War.",
    "He gave his age as older than it was.\u201d There was a touch of the proud mother in her voice.",
    "\u201cThis was made from a streamline aeroplane wire and was given to me by my son as a souvenir of the War.\u201d\n\n\u201cI see madame.",
    "That brings us to another matter.",
    "Your son where is he now It is necessary that he should be telegraphed to without delay.\u201d\n\n\u201cJack He is on his way to Buenos Ayres.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.",
    "My husband telegraphed to him yesterday.",
    "He had sent him on business to Paris but yesterday he discovered that it would be necessary for him to proceed without delay to South America.",
    "There was a boat leaving Cherbourg for Buenos Ayres last night and he wired him to catch it.\u201d\n\n\u201cHave you any knowledge of what the business in Buenos Ayres was\u201d\n\n\u201cNo monsieur I know nothing of its nature but Buenos Ayres is not my son\u2019s final destination.",
    "He was going overland from there to Santiago.\u201d\n\nAnd in unison the magistrate and the commissary exclaimed\n\n\u201cSantiago Again Santiago\u201d\n\nIt was at this moment when we were all stunned by the mention of that word that Poirot approached Mrs. Renauld.",
    "He had been standing by the window like a man lost in a dream and I doubt if he had fully taken in what had passed.",
    "He paused by the lady\u2019s side with a bow.",
    "\u201cPardon madame but may I examine your wrists.\u201d\n\nThough slightly surprised at the request Mrs. Renauld held them out to him.",
    "Round each of them was a cruel red mark where the cords had bitten into the flesh.",
    "As he examined them I fancied that a momentary flicker of excitement I had seen in his eyes disappeared.",
    "\u201cThey must cause you great pain\u201d he said and once more he looked puzzled.",
    "But the magistrate was speaking excitedly.",
    "\u201cYoung M. Renauld must be communicated with at once by wireless.",
    "It is vital that we should know anything he can tell us about this trip to Santiago.\u201d He hesitated.",
    "\u201cI hoped he might have been near at hand so that we could have saved you pain madame.\u201d He paused.",
    "\u201cYou mean\u201d she said in a low voice \u201cthe identification of my husband\u2019s body\u201d\n\nThe magistrate bowed his head.",
    "\u201cI am a strong woman monsieur.",
    "I can bear all that is required of me.",
    "I am ready\u2014now.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh tomorrow will be quite soon enough I assure you\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI prefer to get it over\u201d she said in a low tone a spasm of pain crossing her face.",
    "\u201cIf you will be so good as to give me your arm Doctor\u201d\n\nThe doctor hastened forward a cloak was thrown over Mrs. Renauld\u2019s shoulders and a slow procession went down the stairs.",
    "M. Bex hurried on ahead to open the door of the shed.",
    "In a minute or two Mrs. Renauld appeared in the doorway.",
    "She was very pale but resolute.",
    "Behind her M. Hautet was clacking commiserations and apologies like an animated hen.",
    "She raised her hand to her face.",
    "\u201cA moment messieurs while I steel myself.\u201d\n\nShe took her hand away and looked down at the dead man.",
    "Then the marvellous selfcontrol which had upheld her so far deserted her.",
    "\u201cPaul\u201d she cried.",
    "\u201cHusband Oh God\u201d And pitching forward she fell unconscious to the ground.",
    "Instantly Poirot was beside her he raised the lid of her eye felt her pulse.",
    "When he had satisfied himself that she had really fainted he drew aside.",
    "He caught me by the arm.",
    "\u201cI am an imbecile my friend If ever there was love and grief in a woman\u2019s voice I heard it then.",
    "My little idea was all wrong.",
    "Eh bien I must start again\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n6\n\nThe Scene of the Crime\n\n\nBetween them the doctor and M. Hautet carried the unconscious woman into the house.",
    "The commissary looked after them shaking his head.",
    "\u201cPauvre femme\u201d he murmured to himself.",
    "\u201cThe shock was too much for her.",
    "Well well we can do nothing.",
    "Now M. Poirot shall we visit the place where the crime was committed\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you please M. Bex.\u201d\n\nWe passed through the house and out by the front door.",
    "Poirot had looked up at the staircase in passing and shook his head in a dissatisfied manner.",
    "\u201cIt is to me incredible that the servants heard nothing.",
    "The creaking of that staircase with three people descending it would awaken the dead\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was the middle of the night remember.",
    "They were sound asleep by then.\u201d\n\nBut Poirot continued to shake his head as though not fully accepting the explanation.",
    "On the sweep of the drive he paused looking up at the house.",
    "\u201cWhat moved them in the first place to try if the front door were open It was a most unlikely thing that it should be.",
    "It was far more probable that they should at once try to force a window.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut all the windows on the ground floor are barred with iron shutters\u201d objected the commissary.",
    "Poirot pointed to a window on the first floor.",
    "\u201cThat is the window of the bedroom we have just come from is it not And see\u2014there is a tree by which it would be the easiest thing in the world to mount.\u201d\n\n\u201cPossibly\u201d admitted the other.",
    "\u201cBut they could not have done so without leaving footprints in the flowerbed.\u201d\n\nI saw the justice of his words.",
    "There were two large oval flowerbeds planted with scarlet geraniums one each side of the steps leading up to the front door.",
    "The tree in question had its roots actually at the back of the bed itself and it would have been impossible to reach it without stepping on the bed.",
    "\u201cYou see\u201d continued the commissary \u201cowing to the dry weather no prints would show on the drive or paths but on the soft mould of the flowerbed it would have been a very different affair.\u201d\n\nPoirot went close to the bed and studied it attentively.",
    "As Bex had said the mould was perfectly smooth.",
    "There was not an indentation on it anywhere.",
    "Poirot nodded as though convinced and we turned away but he suddenly darted off and began examining the other flowerbed.",
    "\u201cM.",
    "Bex\u201d he called.",
    "\u201cSee here.",
    "Here are plenty of traces for you.\u201d\n\nThe commissary joined him\u2014and smiled.",
    "\u201cMy dear M. Poirot those are without doubt the footprints of the gardener\u2019s large hobnailed boots.",
    "In any case it would have no importance since this side we have no tree and consequently no means of gaining access to the upper story.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrue\u201d said Poirot evidently crestfallen.",
    "\u201cSo you think these footprints are of no importance\u201d\n\n\u201cNot the least in the world.\u201d\n\nThen to my utter astonishment Poirot pronounced these words\n\n\u201cI do not agree with you.",
    "I have a little idea that these footprints are the most important things we have seen yet.\u201d\n\nM. Bex said nothing merely shrugged his shoulders.",
    "He was far too courteous to utter his real opinion.",
    "\u201cShall we proceed\u201d he asked instead.",
    "\u201cCertainly.",
    "I can investigate this matter of the footprints later\u201d said Poirot cheerfully.",
    "Instead of following the drive down to the gate M. Bex turned up a path that branched off at right angles.",
    "It led up a slight incline round to the right of the house and was bordered on either side by a kind of shrubbery.",
    "Suddenly it emerged into a little clearing from which one obtained a view of the sea.",
    "A seat had been placed here and not far from it was a rather ramshackle shed.",
    "A few steps further on a neat line of small bushes marked the boundary of the Villa grounds.",
    "M. Bex pushed his way through these and we found ourselves on a wide stretch of open downs.",
    "I looked round and saw something that filled me with astonishment.",
    "\u201cWhy this is a golf course\u201d I cried.",
    "Bex nodded.",
    "\u201cThe limits are not completed yet\u201d he explained.",
    "\u201cIt is hoped to be able to open them sometime next month.",
    "It was some of the men working on them who discovered the body early this morning.\u201d\n\nI gave a gasp.",
    "A little to my left where for the moment I had overlooked it was a long narrow pit and by it face downwards was the body of a man For a moment my heart gave a terrible leap and I had a wild fancy that the tragedy had been duplicated.",
    "But the commissary dispelled my illusion by moving forward with a sharp exclamation of annoyance\n\n\u201cWhat have my police been about They had strict orders to allow no one near the place without proper credentials\u201d\n\nThe man on the ground turned his head over his shoulder.",
    "\u201cBut I have proper credentials\u201d he remarked and rose slowly to his feet.",
    "\u201cMy dear M. Giraud\u201d cried the commissary.",
    "\u201cI had no idea that you had arrived even.",
    "The examining magistrate has been awaiting you with the utmost impatience.\u201d\n\nAs he spoke I was scanning the newcomer with the keenest curiosity.",
    "The famous detective from the Paris S\u00fbret\u00e9 was familiar to me by name and I was extremely interested to see him in the flesh.",
    "He was very tall perhaps about thirty years of age with auburn hair and moustache and a military carriage.",
    "There was a trace of arrogance in his manner which showed that he was fully alive to his own importance.",
    "Bex introduced us presenting Poirot as a colleague.",
    "A flicker of interest came into the detective\u2019s eye.",
    "\u201cI know you by name M. Poirot\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cYou cut quite a figure in the old days didn\u2019t you But methods are very different now.\u201d\n\n\u201cCrimes though are very much the same\u201d remarked Poirot gently.",
    "I saw at once that Giraud was prepared to be hostile.",
    "He resented the other being associated with him and I felt that if he came across any clue of importance he would be more than likely to keep it to himself.",
    "\u201cThe examining magistrate\u2014\u201d began Bex again.",
    "But Giraud interrupted him rudely\n\n\u201cA fig for the examining magistrate The light is the important thing.",
    "For all practical purposes it will be gone in another halfhour or so.",
    "I know all about the case and the people at the house will do very well until tomorrow but if we\u2019re going to find a clue to the murderers here is the spot we shall find it.",
    "Is it your police who have been trampling all over the place I thought they knew better nowadays.\u201d\n\n\u201cAssuredly they do.",
    "The marks you complain of were made by the workmen who discovered the body.\u201d\n\nThe other grunted disgustedly.",
    "\u201cI can see the tracks where the three of them came through the hedge\u2014but they were cunning.",
    "You can just recognize the centre footmarks as those of M. Renauld but those on either side have been carefully obliterated.",
    "Not that there would really be much to see anyway on this hard ground but they weren\u2019t taking any chances.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe external sign\u201d said Poirot.",
    "\u201cThat is what you seek eh\u201d\n\nThe other detective stared.",
    "\u201cOf course.\u201d\n\nA very faint smile came to Poirot\u2019s lips.",
    "He seemed about to speak but checked himself.",
    "He bent down to where a spade was lying.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s what the grave was dug with right enough\u201d said Giraud.",
    "\u201cBut you\u2019ll get nothing from it.",
    "It was Renauld\u2019s own spade and the man who used it wore gloves.",
    "Here they are.\u201d He gesticulated with his foot to where two soiled earthstained gloves were lying.",
    "\u201cAnd they\u2019re Renauld\u2019s too\u2014or at least his gardener\u2019s.",
    "I tell you the men who planned out this crime were taking no chances.",
    "The man was stabbed with his own dagger and would have been buried with his own spade.",
    "They counted on leaving no traces But I\u2019ll beat them.",
    "There\u2019s always something And I mean to find it.\u201d\n\nBut Poirot was now apparently interested in something else a short discoloured piece of leadpiping which lay beside the spade.",
    "He touched it delicately with his finger.",
    "\u201cAnd does this too belong to the murdered man\u201d he asked and I thought I detected a subtle flavour of irony in the question.",
    "Giraud shrugged his shoulders to indicate that he neither knew nor cared.",
    "\u201cMay have been lying around here for weeks.",
    "Anyway it doesn\u2019t interest me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI on the contrary find it very interesting\u201d said Poirot sweetly.",
    "I guessed that he was merely bent on annoying the Paris detective and if so he succeeded.",
    "The other turned away rudely remarking that he had no time to waste and bending down he resumed his minute search of the ground.",
    "Meanwhile Poirot as though struck by a sudden idea stepped back over the boundary and tried the door of the little shed.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s locked\u201d said Giraud over his shoulder.",
    "\u201cBut it\u2019s only a place where the gardener keeps his rubbish.",
    "The spade didn\u2019t come from there but from the toolshed up by the house.\u201d\n\n\u201cMarvellous\u201d murmured M. Bex to me ecstatically.",
    "\u201cHe has been here but half an hour and he already knows everything What a man Undoubtedly Giraud is the greatest detective alive today.\u201d\n\nAlthough I disliked the detective heartily I nevertheless was secretly impressed.",
    "Efficiency seemed to radiate from the man.",
    "I could not help feeling that so far Poirot had not greatly distinguished himself and it vexed me.",
    "He seemed to be directing his attention to all sorts of silly puerile points that had nothing to do with the case.",
    "Indeed at this juncture he suddenly asked\n\n\u201cM.",
    "Bex tell me I pray you the meaning of this whitewashed line that extends all round the grave.",
    "Is it a device of the police\u201d\n\n\u201cNo M. Poirot it is an affair of the golf course.",
    "It shows that there is here to be a \u2018bunkair\u2019 as you call it.\u201d\n\n\u201cA bunkair\u201d Poirot turned to me.",
    "\u201cThat is the irregular hole filled with sand and a bank at one side is it not\u201d\n\nI concurred.",
    "\u201cYou do not play the golf M. Poirot\u201d inquired Bex.",
    "\u201cI Never What a game\u201d He became excited.",
    "\u201cFigure to yourself each hole it is of a different length.",
    "The obstacles they are not arranged mathematically.",
    "Even the greens are frequently up one side There is only one pleasing thing\u2014the how do you call them\u2014tee boxes They at least are symmetrical.\u201d\n\nI could not refrain from a laugh at the way the game appeared to Poirot and my little friend smiled at me affectionately bearing no malice.",
    "Then he asked\n\n\u201cBut M. Renauld without doubt he played the golf\u201d\n\n\u201cYes he was a keen golfer.",
    "It\u2019s mainly owing to him and to his large subscriptions that this work is being carried forward.",
    "He even had a say in the designing of it.\u201d\n\nPoirot nodded thoughtfully.",
    "Then he remarked\n\n\u201cIt was not a very good choice they made\u2014of a spot to bury the body When the men began to dig up the ground all would have been discovered.\u201d\n\n\u201cExactly\u201d cried Giraud triumphantly.",
    "\u201cAnd that proves that they were strangers to the place.",
    "It\u2019s an excellent piece of indirect evidence.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes\u201d said Poirot doubtfully.",
    "\u201cNo one who knew would bury a body there\u2014unless\u2014unless\u2014they wanted it to be discovered.",
    "And that is clearly absurd is it not\u201d\n\nGiraud did not even trouble to reply.",
    "\u201cYes\u201d said Poirot in a somewhat dissatisfied voice.",
    "\u201cYes\u2014undoubtedly\u2014absurd\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n7\n\nThe Mysterious Madame Daubreuil\n\n\nAs we retraced our steps to the house M. Bex excused himself for leaving us explaining that he must immediately acquaint the examining magistrate with the fact of Giraud\u2019s arrival.",
    "Giraud himself had been obviously delighted when Poirot declared that he had seen all he wanted.",
    "The last thing we observed as we left the spot was Giraud crawling about on all fours with a thoroughness in his search that I could not but admire.",
    "Poirot guessed my thoughts for as soon as we were alone he remarked ironically\n\n\u201cAt last you have seen the detective you admire\u2014the human foxhound Is it not so my friend\u201d\n\n\u201cAt any rate he\u2019s doing something\u201d I said with asperity.",
    "\u201cIf there\u2019s anything to find he\u2019ll find it.",
    "Now you\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cEh bien I also have found something A piece of leadpiping.\u201d\n\n\u201cNonsense Poirot.",
    "You know very well that\u2019s got nothing to do with it.",
    "I meant little things\u2014traces that may lead us infallibly to the murderers.\u201d\n\n\u201cMon ami a clue of two feet long is every bit as valuable as one measuring two millimetres But it is the romantic idea that all important clues must be infinitesimal As to the piece of leadpiping having nothing to do with the crime you say that because Giraud told you so.",
    "No\u201d\u2014as I was about to interpose a question\u2014\u201cwe will say no more.",
    "Leave Giraud to his search and me to my ideas.",
    "The case seems straightforward enough\u2014and yet\u2014and yet mon ami I am not satisfied And do you know why Because of the wrist watch that is two hours fast.",
    "And then there are several curious little points that do not seem to fit in.",
    "For instance if the object of the murderers was revenge why did they not stab Renauld in his sleep and have done with it\u201d\n\n\u201cThey wanted the \u2018secret\u2019\u200a\u201d I reminded him.",
    "Poirot brushed a speck of dust from his sleeve with a dissatisfied air.",
    "\u201cWell where is this \u2018secret\u2019 Presumably some distance away since they wish him to dress himself.",
    "Yet he is found murdered close at hand almost within earshot of the house.",
    "Then again it is pure chance that a weapon such as the dagger should be lying about casually ready to hand.\u201d\n\nHe paused frowning and then went on\n\n\u201cWhy did the servants hear nothing Were they drugged Was there an accomplice and did that accomplice see to it that the front door should remain open I wonder if\u2014\u201d\n\nHe stopped abruptly.",
    "We had reached the drive in front of the house.",
    "Suddenly he turned to me.",
    "\u201cMy friend I am about to surprise you\u2014to please you I have taken your reproaches to heart We will examine some footprints\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere\u201d\n\n\u201cIn that righthand bed yonder.",
    "M. Bex says that they are the footmarks of the gardener.",
    "Let us see if that is so.",
    "See he approaches with his wheelbarrow.\u201d\n\nIndeed an elderly man was just crossing the drive with a barrowful of seedlings.",
    "Poirot called to him and he set down the barrow and came hobbling towards us.",
    "\u201cYou are going to ask him for one of his boots to compare with the footmarks\u201d I asked breathlessly.",
    "My faith in Poirot revived a little.",
    "Since he said the footprints in this righthand bed were important presumably they were.",
    "\u201cExactly\u201d said Poirot.",
    "\u201cBut won\u2019t he think it very odd\u201d\n\n\u201cHe will not think about it at all.\u201d\n\nWe could say no more for the old man had joined us.",
    "\u201cYou want me for something monsieur\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.",
    "You have been gardener here a long time haven\u2019t you\u201d\n\n\u201cTwentyfour years monsieur.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd your name is\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAuguste monsieur.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was admiring these magnificent geraniums.",
    "They are truly superb.",
    "They have been planted long\u201d\n\n\u201cSome time monsieur.",
    "But of course to keep the beds looking smart one must keep bedding out a few new plants and remove those that are over besides keeping the old blooms well picked off.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou put in some new plants yesterday didn\u2019t you Those in the middle there and in the other bed also\u201d\n\n\u201cMonsieur has a sharp eye.",
    "It takes always a day or so for them to \u2018pick up.\u2019 Yes I put ten new plants in each bed last night.",
    "As Monsieur doubtless knows one should not put in plants when the sun is hot.\u201d\n\nAuguste was charmed with Poirot\u2019s interest and was quite inclined to be garrulous.",
    "\u201cThat is a splendid specimen there\u201d said Poirot pointing.",
    "\u201cMight I perhaps have a cutting of it\u201d\n\n\u201cBut certainly monsieur.\u201d The old fellow stepped into the bed and carefully took a slip from the plant Poirot had admired.",
    "Poirot was profuse in his thanks and Auguste departed to his barrow.",
    "\u201cYou see\u201d said Poirot with a smile as he bent over the bed to examine the indentation of the gardener\u2019s hobnailed boot.",
    "\u201cIt is quite simple.\u201d\n\n\u201cI did not realize\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThat the foot would be inside the boot You do not use your excellent mental capacities sufficiently.",
    "Well what of the footmark\u201d\n\nI examined the bed carefully.",
    "\u201cAll the footmarks in the bed were made by the same boot\u201d I said at length after a careful study.",
    "\u201cYou think so Eh bien I agree with you\u201d said Poirot.",
    "He seemed quite uninterested and as though he were thinking of something else.",
    "\u201cAt any rate\u201d I remarked \u201cyou will have one bee less in your bonnet now.\u201d\n\n\u201cMon Dieu But what an idiom What does it mean\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat I meant was that now you will give up your interest in these footmarks.\u201d\n\nBut to my surprise Poirot shook his head.",
    "\u201cNo no mon ami.",
    "At last I am on the right track.",
    "I am still in the dark but as I hinted just now to M. Bex these footmarks are the most important and interesting things in the case That poor Giraud\u2014I should not be surprised if he took no notice of them whatever.\u201d\n\nAt that moment the front door opened and M. Hautet and the commissary came down the steps.",
    "\u201cAh M. Poirot we were coming to look for you\u201d said the magistrate.",
    "\u201cIt is getting late but I wish to pay a visit to Madame Daubreuil.",
    "Without doubt she will be very much upset by M. Renauld\u2019s death and we may be fortunate enough to get a clue from her.",
    "The secret that he did not confide to his wife it is possible that he may have told it to the woman whose love held him enslaved.",
    "We know where our Samsons are weak don\u2019t we\u201d\n\nI admired the picturesqueness of M. Hautet\u2019s language.",
    "I suspected that the examining magistrate was by now thoroughly enjoying his part in the mysterious drama.",
    "\u201cIs M. Giraud not going to accompany us\u201d asked Poirot.",
    "\u201cM.",
    "Giraud has shown clearly that he prefers to conduct the case in his own way\u201d said M. Hautet dryly.",
    "One could see easily enough that Giraud\u2019s cavalier treatment of the examining magistrate had not prejudiced the latter in his favour.",
    "We said no more but fell into line.",
    "Poirot walked with the examining magistrate and the commissary and I followed a few paces behind.",
    "\u201cThere is no doubt that Fran\u00e7oise\u2019s story is substantially correct\u201d he remarked to me in a confidential tone.",
    "\u201cI have been telephoning headquarters.",
    "It seems that three times in the last six weeks\u2014that is to say since the arrival of M. Renauld at Merlinville\u2014Madame Daubreuil has paid a large sum in notes into her banking account.",
    "Altogether the sum totals two hundred thousand francs\u201d\n\n\u201cDear me\u201d I said considering \u201cthat must be something like four thousand pounds\u201d\n\n\u201cPrecisely.",
    "Yes there can be no doubt that he was absolutely infatuated.",
    "But it remains to be seen whether he confided his secret to her.",
    "The examining magistrate is hopeful but I hardly share his views.\u201d\n\nDuring this conversation we were walking down the lane towards the fork in the road where our car had halted earlier in the afternoon and in another moment I realized that the Villa Marguerite the home of the mysterious Madame Daubreuil was the small house from which the beautiful girl had emerged.",
    "\u201cShe has lived here for many years\u201d said the commissary nodding his head towards the house.",
    "\u201cVery quietly very unobtrusively.",
    "She seems to have no friends or relations other than the acquaintances she has made in Merlinville.",
    "She never refers to the past nor to her husband.",
    "One does not even know if he is alive or dead.",
    "There is a mystery about her you comprehend.\u201d I nodded my interest growing.",
    "\u201cAnd\u2014the daughter\u201d I ventured.",
    "\u201cA truly beautiful young girl\u2014modest devout all that she should be.",
    "One pities her for though she may know nothing of the past a man who wants to ask her hand in marriage must necessarily inform himself and then\u2014\u201d The commissary shrugged his shoulders cynically.",
    "\u201cBut it would not be her fault\u201d I cried with rising indignation.",
    "\u201cNo.",
    "But what will you A man is particular about his wife\u2019s antecedents.\u201d\n\nI was prevented from further argument by our arrival at the door.",
    "M. Hautet rang the bell.",
    "A few minutes elapsed and then we heard a footfall within and the door was opened.",
    "On the threshold stood my young goddess of that afternoon.",
    "When she saw us the colour left her cheeks leaving her deathly white and her eyes widened with apprehension.",
    "There was no doubt about it she was afraid\n\n\u201cMademoiselle Daubreuil\u201d said M. Hautet sweeping off his hat \u201cwe regret infinitely to disturb you but the exigencies of the Law\u2014you comprehend My compliments to Madame your mother and will she have the goodness to grant me a few moments\u2019 interview.\u201d\n\nFor a moment the girl stood motionless.",
    "Her left hand was pressed to her side as though to still the sudden unconquerable agitation of her heart.",
    "But she mastered herself and said in a low voice\n\n\u201cI will go and see.",
    "Please come inside.\u201d\n\nShe entered a room on the left of the hall and we heard the low murmur of her voice.",
    "And then another voice much the same in timbre but with a slightly harder inflection behind its mellow roundness said\n\n\u201cBut certainly.",
    "Ask them to enter.\u201d\n\nIn another minute we were face to face with the mysterious Madame Daubreuil.",
    "She was not nearly so tall as her daughter and the rounded curves of her figure had all the grace of full maturity.",
    "Her hair again unlike her daughter\u2019s was dark and parted in the middle in the madonna style.",
    "Her eyes half hidden by the drooping lids were blue.",
    "There was a dimple in the round chin and the half parted lips seemed always to hover on the verge of a mysterious smile.",
    "There was something almost exaggeratedly feminine about her at once yielding and seductive.",
    "Though very well preserved she was certainly no longer young but her charm was of the quality which is independent of age.",
    "Standing there in her black dress with the fresh white collar and cuffs her hands clasped together she looked subtly appealing and helpless.",
    "\u201cYou wished to see me monsieur\u201d she asked.",
    "\u201cYes madame.\u201d M. Hautet cleared his throat.",
    "\u201cI am investigating the death of M. Renauld.",
    "You have heard of it no doubt\u201d\n\nShe bowed her head without speaking.",
    "Her expression did not change.",
    "\u201cWe came to ask you whether you can\u2014er\u2014throw any light upon the circumstances surrounding it\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u201d The surprise of her tone was excellent.",
    "\u201cYes madame.",
    "It would perhaps be better if we could speak to you alone.\u201d He looked meaningly in the direction of the girl.",
    "Madame Daubreuil turned to her.",
    "\u201cMarthe dear\u2014\u201d\n\nBut the girl shook her head.",
    "\u201cNo maman I will not go.",
    "I am not a child.",
    "I am twentytwo.",
    "I shall not go.\u201d\n\nMadame Daubreuil turned back to the examining magistrate.",
    "\u201cYou see monsieur.\u201d\n\n\u201cI should prefer not to speak before Mademoiselle Daubreuil.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs my daughter says she is not a child.\u201d\n\nFor a moment the magistrate hesitated baffled.",
    "\u201cVery well madame\u201d he said at last.",
    "\u201cHave it your own way.",
    "We have reason to believe that you were in the habit of visiting the dead man at his Villa in the evenings.",
    "Is that so\u201d\n\nThe colour rose in the lady\u2019s pale cheeks but she replied quietly\n\n\u201cI deny your right to ask me such a question\u201d\n\n\u201cMadame we are investigating a murder.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell what of it I had nothing to do with the murder.\u201d\n\n\u201cMadame we do not say that for a moment.",
    "But you knew the dead man well.",
    "Did he ever confide in you as to any danger that threatened him\u201d\n\n\u201cNever.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid he ever mention his life in Santiago and any enemies he may have made there\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen you can give us no help at all\u201d\n\n\u201cI fear not.",
    "I really do not see why you should come to me.",
    "Cannot his wife tell you what you want to know\u201d Her voice held a slender inflection of irony.",
    "\u201cMadame Renauld has told us all she can.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh\u201d said Madame Daubreuil.",
    "\u201cI wonder\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou wonder what madame\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing.\u201d\n\nThe examining magistrate looked at her.",
    "He was aware that he was fighting a duel and that he had no mean antagonist.",
    "\u201cYou persist in your statement that M. Renauld confided nothing in you\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy should you think it likely that he should confide in me\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause madame\u201d said M. Hautet with calculated brutality.",
    "\u201cA man tells to his mistress what he does not always tell to his wife.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh\u201d she sprang forward.",
    "Her eyes flashed fire.",
    "\u201cMonsieur you insult me And before my daughter I can tell you nothing.",
    "Have the goodness to leave my house\u201d\n\nThe honours undoubtedly rested with the lady.",
    "We left the Villa Marguerite like a shamefaced pack of schoolboys.",
    "The magistrate muttered angry ejaculations to himself.",
    "Poirot seemed lost in thought.",
    "Suddenly he came out of his reverie with a start and inquired of M. Hautet if there was a good hotel near at hand.",
    "\u201cThere is a small place the Hotel des Bains on this side of town.",
    "A few hundred yards down the road.",
    "It will be handy for your investigations.",
    "We shall see you in the morning then I presume\u201d\n\n\u201cYes I thank you M. Hautet.\u201d\n\nWith mutual civilities we parted company Poirot and I going towards Merlinville and the others returning to the Villa Genevi\u00e8ve.",
    "\u201cThe French police system is very marvellous\u201d said Poirot looking after them.",
    "\u201cThe information they possess about every one\u2019s life down to the most commonplace detail is extraordinary.",
    "Though he has only been here a little over six weeks they are perfectly well acquainted with M. Renauld\u2019s tastes and pursuits and at a moment\u2019s notice they can produce information as to Madame Daubreuil\u2019s banking account and the sums that have lately been paid in Undoubtedly the dossier is a great institution.",
    "But what is that\u201d He turned sharply.",
    "A figure was running hatless down the road after us.",
    "It was Marthe Daubreuil.",
    "\u201cI beg your pardon\u201d she cried breathlessly as she reached us.",
    "\u201cI\u2014I should not do this I know.",
    "You must not tell my mother.",
    "But is it true what the people say that M. Renauld called in a detective before he died and\u2014and that you are he\u201d\n\n\u201cYes mademoiselle\u201d said Poirot gently.",
    "\u201cIt is quite true.",
    "But how did you learn it\u201d\n\n\u201cFran\u00e7oise told our Am\u00e9lie\u201d explained Marthe with a blush.",
    "Poirot made a grimace.",
    "\u201cThe secrecy it is impossible in an affair of this kind Not that it matters.",
    "Well mademoiselle what is it you want to know\u201d\n\nThe girl hesitated.",
    "She seemed longing yet fearing to speak.",
    "At last almost in a whisper she asked\n\n\u201cIs\u2014any one suspected\u201d\n\nPoirot eyed her keenly.",
    "Then he replied evasively\n\n\u201cSuspicion is in the air at present mademoiselle.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes I know\u2014but\u2014any one in particular\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy do you want to know\u201d\n\nThe girl seemed frightened by the question.",
    "All at once Poirot\u2019s words about her earlier in the day recurred to me.",
    "The \u201cgirl with the anxious eyes\u201d\n\n\u201cM.",
    "Renauld was always very kind to me\u201d she replied at last.",
    "\u201cIt is natural that I should be interested.\u201d\n\n\u201cI see\u201d said Poirot.",
    "\u201cWell mademoiselle suspicion at present is hovering round two persons.\u201d\n\n\u201cTwo\u201d\n\nI could have sworn there was a note of surprise and relief in her voice.",
    "\u201cTheir names are unknown but they are presumed to be Chilians from Santiago.",
    "And now mademoiselle you see what comes of being young and beautiful I have betrayed professional secrets for you\u201d\n\nThe girl laughed merrily and then rather shyly she thanked him.",
    "\u201cI must run back now.",
    "Maman will miss me.\u201d\n\nAnd she turned and ran back up the road looking like a modern Atalanta.",
    "I stared after her.",
    "\u201cMon ami\u201d said Poirot in his gentle ironical voice \u201cis it that we are to remain planted here all night\u2014just because you have seen a beautiful young woman and your head is in a whirl\u201d\n\nI laughed and apologized.",
    "\u201cBut she is beautiful Poirot.",
    "Any one might be excused for being bowled over by her.\u201d\n\nPoirot groaned.",
    "\u201cMon Dieu But it is that you have the susceptible heart\u201d\n\n\u201cPoirot\u201d I said \u201cdo you remember after the Styles Case when\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you were in love with two charming women at once and neither of them were for you Yes I remember.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou consoled me by saying that perhaps some day we should hunt together again and that then\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cEh bien\u201d\n\n\u201cWell we are hunting together again and\u2014\u201d I paused and laughed rather selfconsciously.",
    "But to my surprise Poirot shook his head very earnestly.",
    "\u201cAh mon ami do not set your heart on Marthe Daubreuil.",
    "She is not for you that one Take it from Papa Poirot\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy\u201d I cried \u201cthe commissary assured me that she was as good as she is beautiful A perfect angel\u201d\n\n\u201cSome of the greatest criminals I have known had the faces of angels\u201d remarked Poirot cheerfully.",
    "\u201cA malformation of the grey cells may coincide quite easily with the face of a madonna.\u201d\n\n\u201cPoirot\u201d I cried horrified \u201cyou cannot mean that you suspect an innocent child like this\u201d\n\n\u201cTatata Do not excite yourself I have not said that I suspected her.",
    "But you must admit that her anxiety to know about the case is somewhat unusual.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor once I see further than you do\u201d I said.",
    "\u201cHer anxiety is not for herself\u2014but for her mother.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy friend\u201d said Poirot \u201cas usual you see nothing at all.",
    "Madame Daubreuil is very well able to look after herself without her daughter worrying about her.",
    "I admit I was teasing you just now but all the same I repeat what I said before.",
    "Do not set your heart on that girl.",
    "She is not for you I Hercule Poirot know it.",
    "Sacr\u00e9 if only I could remember where I had seen that face\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat face\u201d I asked surprised.",
    "\u201cThe daughter\u2019s\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.",
    "The mother\u2019s.\u201d\n\nNoting my surprise he nodded emphatically.",
    "\u201cBut yes\u2014it is as I tell you.",
    "It was a long time ago when I was still with the Police in Belgium.",
    "I have never actually seen the woman before but I have seen her picture\u2014and in connection with some case.",
    "I rather fancy\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYes\u201d\n\n\u201cI may be mistaken but I rather fancy that it was a murder case\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n8\n\nAn Unexpected Meeting\n\n\nWe were up at the Villa betimes next morning.",
    "The man on guard at the gate did not bar our way this time.",
    "Instead he respectfully saluted us and we passed on to the house.",
    "The maid L\u00e9onie was just coming down the stairs and seemed not averse to the prospect of a little conversation.",
    "Poirot inquired after the health of Mrs. Renauld.",
    "L\u00e9onie shook her head.",
    "\u201cShe is terribly upset la pauvre dame She will eat nothing\u2014but nothing And she is as pale as a ghost.",
    "It is heartrending to see her.",
    "Ah par exemple it is not I who would grieve like that for a man who had deceived me with another woman\u201d\n\nPoirot nodded sympathetically.",
    "\u201cWhat you say is very just but what will you The heart of a woman who loves will forgive many blows.",
    "Still undoubtedly there must have been many scenes of recrimination between them in the last few months\u201d\n\nAgain L\u00e9onie shook her head.",
    "\u201cNever monsieur.",
    "Never have I heard Madame utter a word of protest\u2014of reproach even She had the temper and disposition of an angel\u2014quite different to Monsieur.\u201d\n\n\u201cMonsieur Renauld had not the temper of an angel\u201d\n\n\u201cFar from it.",
    "When he enraged himself the whole house knew of it.",
    "The day that he quarrelled with M. Jack\u2014ma foi they might have been heard in the market place they shouted so loud\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed\u201d said Poirot.",
    "\u201cAnd when did this quarrel take place\u201d\n\n\u201cOh it was just before M. Jack went to Paris.",
    "Almost he missed his train.",
    "He came out of the library and caught up his bag which he had left in the hall.",
    "The automobile it was being repaired and he had to run for the station.",
    "I was dusting the salon and I saw him pass and his face was white\u2014white\u2014with two burning spots of red.",
    "Ah but he was angry\u201d\n\nL\u00e9onie was enjoying her narrative thoroughly.",
    "\u201cAnd the dispute what was it about\u201d\n\n\u201cAh that I do not know\u201d confessed L\u00e9onie.",
    "\u201cIt is true that they shouted but their voices were so loud and high and they spoke so fast that only one well acquainted with English could have comprehended.",
    "But Monsieur he was like a thundercloud all day Impossible to please him\u201d\n\nThe sound of a door shutting upstairs cut short L\u00e9onie\u2019s loquacity.",
    "\u201cAnd Fran\u00e7oise who awaits me\u201d she exclaimed awakening to a tardy remembrance of her duties.",

    "It was certainly hot.",
    "I turned up the path we had taken the day before.",
    "I had a mind to study the scene of the crime myself.",
    "I did not go directly to the spot however but turned aside into the bushes so as to come out on the links some hundred yards or so further to the right.",
    "If Giraud were still on the spot I wanted to observe his methods before he knew of my presence.",
    "But the shrubbery here was much denser and I had quite a struggle to force my way through.",

    "I took the girl through the shrubbery round to the back of the house where the small shed was.",
    "I recollected that yesterday evening after relocking the door M. Bex had left the key with the sergent de ville Marchaud \u201cin case M. Giraud should require it while we are upstairs.\u201d I thought it quite likely that the S\u00fbret\u00e9 detective after using it had returned it to Marchaud again.",
    "Leaving the girl out of sight in the shrubbery I entered the house.",
    "Marchaud was on duty outside the door of the salon.",

    "\u201cHere it is.",
    "M. le juge gave orders that all facilities were to be placed at your disposal.",
    "You will return it to me when you have finished out there that is all.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course.\u201d\n\nI felt a thrill of satisfaction as I realized that in Marchaud\u2019s eyes at least I ranked equally in importance with Poirot.",
    "The girl was waiting for me.",
    "She gave an exclamation of delight as she saw the key in my hand.",
    "\u201cYou\u2019ve got it then\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course\u201d I said coolly.",
    "\u201cAll the same you know what I\u2019m doing is highly irregular.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been a perfect duck and I shan\u2019t forget it.",
    "Come along.",
    "They can\u2019t see us from the house can they\u201d\n\n\u201cWait a minute.\u201d I arrested her eager advance.",
    "\u201cI won\u2019t stop you if you really wish to go in.",
    "But do you You\u2019ve seen the grave and the grounds and you\u2019ve heard all the details of the affair.",
    "Isn\u2019t that enough for you This is going to be gruesome you know and\u2014unpleasant.\u201d\n\nShe looked at me for a moment with an expression that I could not quite fathom.",
    "Then she laughed.",
    "\u201cMe for the horrors\u201d she said.",
    "\u201cCome along.\u201d\n\nIn silence we arrived at the door of the shed.",
    "I opened it and we passed in.",
    "I walked over to the body and gently pulled down the sheet as M. Bex had done the preceding afternoon.",
    "A little gasping sound escaped from the girl\u2019s lips and I turned and looked at her.",
    "There was horror on her face now and those debonair high spirits of hers were quenched utterly.",
    "She had not chosen to listen to my advice and she was punished now for her disregard of it.",
    "I felt singularly merciless towards her.",
    "She should go through with it now.",
    "I turned the corpse gently over.",
    "\u201cYou see\u201d I said \u201che was stabbed in the back.\u201d\n\nHer voice was almost soundless.",
    "\u201cWith what\u201d\n\nI nodded towards the glass jar.",
    "\u201cThat dagger.\u201d\n\nSuddenly the girl reeled and then sank down in a heap.",
    "I sprang to her assistance.",
    "\u201cYou are faint.",
    "Come out of here.",
    "It has been too much for you.\u201d\n\n\u201cWater\u201d she murmured.",
    "\u201cQuick.",
    "Water.",
    "\u2026\u201d\n\nI left her and rushed into the house.",
    "Fortunately none of the servants were about and I was able to secure a glass of water unobserved and add a few drops of brandy from a pocket flask.",
    "In a few minutes I was back again.",
    "The girl was lying as I had left her but a few sips of the brandy and water revived her in a marvellous manner.",
    "\u201cTake me out of here\u2014oh quickly quickly\u201d she cried shuddering.",
    "Supporting her with my arm I led her out into the air and she pulled the door to behind her.",
    "Then she drew a deep breath.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s better.",
    "Oh it was horrible Why did you ever let me go in\u201d\n\nI felt this to be so feminine that I could not forbear a smile.",
    "Secretly I was not dissatisfied with her collapse.",
    "It proved that she was not quite so callous as I had thought her.",
    "After all she was little more than a child and her curiosity had probably been of the unthinking order.",
    "\u201cI did my best to stop you you know\u201d I said gently.",
    "\u201cI suppose you did.",
    "Well goodbye.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook here you can\u2019t start off like that\u2014all alone.",
    "You\u2019re not fit for it.",
    "I insist on accompanying you back to Merlinville.\u201d\n\n\u201cNonsense.",
    "I\u2019m quite all right now.\u201d\n\n\u201cSupposing you felt faint again No I shall come with you.\u201d\n\nBut this she combated with a good deal of energy.",
    "In the end however I prevailed so far as to be allowed to accompany her to the outskirts of the town.",
    "We retraced our steps over our former route passing the grave again and making a detour on to the road.",
    "Where the first straggling line of shops began she stopped and held out her hand.",
    "\u201cGoodbye and thank you ever so much for coming with me.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you sure you\u2019re all right now\u201d\n\n\u201cQuite thanks.",
    "I hope you won\u2019t get into any trouble over showing me things\u201d\n\nI disclaimed the idea lightly.",
    "\u201cWell goodbye.\u201d\n\n\u201cAu revoir\u201d I corrected.",
    "\u201cIf you\u2019re staying here we shall meet again.\u201d\n\nShe flashed a smile at me.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s so.",
    "Au revoir then.\u201d\n\n\u201cWait a second you haven\u2019t told me your address\u201d\n\n\u201cOh I\u2019m staying at the H\u00f4tel du Phare.",
    "It\u2019s a little place but quite good.",
    "Come and look me up tomorrow.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will\u201d I said with perhaps rather unnecessary empressement.",
    "I watched her out of sight then turned and retraced my steps to the Villa.",
    "I remembered that I had not relocked the door of the shed.",
    "Fortunately no one had noticed the oversight and turning the key I removed it and returned it to the sergent de ville.",
    "And as I did so it came upon me suddenly that though Cinderella had given me her address I still did not know her name.",
    "9\n\nM. Giraud Finds Some Clues\n\n\nIn the Salon I found the examining magistrate busily interrogating the old gardener Auguste.",
    "Poirot and the commissary who were both present greeted me respectively with a smile and a polite bow.",
    "I slipped quietly into a seat.",
    "M. Hautet was painstaking and meticulous in the extreme but did not succeed in eliciting anything of importance.",
    "The gardening gloves Auguste admitted to be his.",
    "He wore them when handling a certain species of primula plant which was poisonous to some people.",
    "He could not say when he had worn them last.",
    "Certainly he had not missed them.",
    "Where were they kept Sometimes in one place sometimes in another.",
    "The spade was usually to be found in the small tool shed.",
    "Was it locked Of course it was locked.",
    "Where was the key kept Parbleu it was in the door of course There was nothing of value to steal.",
    "Who would have expected a party of bandits of assassins Such things did not happen in Madame la Vicomtesse\u2019s time.",
    "M. Hautet signifying that he had finished with him the old man withdrew grumbling to the last.",
    "Remembering Poirot\u2019s unaccountable insistence on the footprints in the flower beds I scrutinized him narrowly as he gave his evidence.",
    "Either he had nothing to do with the crime or he was a consummate actor.",
    "Suddenly just as he was going out of the door an idea struck me.",
    "\u201cPardon M. Hautet\u201d I cried \u201cbut will you permit me to ask him one question\u201d\n\n\u201cBut certainly monsieur.\u201d\n\nThus encouraged I turned to Auguste.",
    "\u201cWhere do you keep your boots\u201d\n\n\u201cSac \u00e0 papier\u201d growled the old man.",
    "\u201cOn my feet.",
    "Where else\u201d\n\n\u201cBut when you go to bed at night\u201d\n\n\u201cUnder my bed.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut who cleans them\u201d\n\n\u201cNobody.",
    "Why should they be cleaned Is it that I promenade myself on the front like a young man On Sunday I wear the Sunday boots bien entendu but otherwise\u2014\u201d he shrugged his shoulders.",
    "I shook my head discouraged.",
    "\u201cWell well\u201d said the magistrate.",
    "\u201cWe do not advance very much.",
    "Undoubtedly we are held up until we get the return cable from Santiago.",
    "Has any one seen Giraud In verity that one lacks politeness I have a very good mind to send for him and\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will not have to send far M. le juge.\u201d\n\nThe quiet voice startled us.",
    "Giraud was standing outside looking in through the open window.",
    "He leaped lightly into the room and advanced to the table.",
    "\u201cHere I am M. le juge at your service.",
    "Accept my excuses for not presenting myself sooner.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot at all.",
    "Not at all\u201d said the magistrate rather confused.",
    "\u201cOf course I am only a detective\u201d continued the other.",
    "\u201cI know nothing of interrogatories.",
    "Were I conducting one I should be inclined to do so without an open window.",
    "Any one standing outside can so easily hear all that passes.",
    "\u2026 But no matter.\u201d\n\nM. Hautet flushed angrily.",
    "There was evidently going to be no love lost between the examining magistrate and the detective in charge of the case.",
    "They had fallen foul of each other at the start.",
    "Perhaps in any event it would have been much the same.",
    "To Giraud all examining magistrates were fools and to M. Hautet who took himself seriously the casual manner of the Paris detective could not fail to give offence.",
    "\u201cEh bien M. Giraud\u201d said the magistrate rather sharply.",
    "\u201cWithout doubt you have been employing your time to a marvel You have the names of the assassins for us have you not And also the precise spot where they find themselves now\u201d\n\nUnmoved by this irony Giraud replied\n\n\u201cI know at least where they have come from.\u201d\n\n\u201cComment\u201d\n\nGiraud took two small objects from his pocket and laid them down on the table.",
    "We crowded round.",
    "The objects were very simple ones the stub of a cigarette and an unlighted match.",
    "The detective wheeled round on Poirot.",
    "\u201cWhat do you see there\u201d he asked.",
    "There was something almost brutal in his tone.",
    "It made my cheeks flush.",
    "But Poirot remained unmoved.",
    "He shrugged his shoulders.",
    "\u201cA cigarette end and a match.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what does that tell you\u201d\n\nPoirot spread out his hands.",
    "\u201cIt tells me\u2014nothing.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh\u201d said Giraud in a satisfied voice.",
    "\u201cYou haven\u2019t made a study of these things.",
    "That\u2019s not an ordinary match\u2014not in this country at least.",
    "It\u2019s common enough in South America.",
    "Luckily it\u2019s unlighted.",
    "I mightn\u2019t have recognized it otherwise.",
    "Evidently one of the men threw away his cigarette end and lit another spilling one match out of the box as he did so.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the other match\u201d asked Poirot.",
    "\u201cWhich match\u201d\n\n\u201cThe one he did light his cigarette with.",
    "You have found that also\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cPerhaps you didn\u2019t search very thoroughly.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot search thoroughly\u2014\u201d For a moment it seemed as though the detective were going to break out angrily but with an effort he controlled himself.",
    "\u201cI see you love a joke M. Poirot.",
    "But in any case match or no match the cigarette end would be sufficient.",
    "It is a South American cigarette with liquorice pectoral paper.\u201d\n\nPoirot bowed.",
    "The commissary spoke\n\n\u201cThe cigarette end and match might have belonged to M. Renauld.",
    "Remember it is only two years since he returned from South America.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo\u201d replied the other confidently.",
    "\u201cI have already searched among the effects of M. Renauld.",
    "The cigarettes he smoked and the matches he used are quite different.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou do not think it odd\u201d asked Poirot \u201cthat these strangers should come unprovided with a weapon with gloves with a spade and that they should so conveniently find all these things\u201d\n\nGiraud smiled in a rather superior manner.",
    "\u201cUndoubtedly it is strange.",
    "Indeed without the theory that I hold it would be inexplicable.\u201d\n\n\u201cAha\u201d said M. Hautet.",
    "\u201cAn accomplice.",
    "An accomplice within the house\u201d\n\n\u201cOr outside it\u201d said Giraud with a peculiar smile.",
    "\u201cBut some one must have admitted them We cannot allow that by an unparalleled piece of good fortune they found the door ajar for them to walk in\u201d\n\n\u201cD\u2019accord M. le juge.",
    "The door was opened for them but it could just as easily be opened from outside\u2014by some one who possessed a key.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut who did possess a key\u201d\n\nGiraud shrugged his shoulders.",
    "\u201cAs for that no one who possesses one is going to admit the fact if they can help it.",
    "But several people might have had one.",
    "M. Jack Renauld the son for instance.",
    "It is true that he is on his way to South America but he might have lost the key or had it stolen from him.",
    "Then there is the gardener\u2014he has been here many years.",
    "One of the younger servants may have a lover.",
    "It is easy to take an impression of a key and have one cut.",
    "There are many possibilities.",
    "Then there is another person who I should judge is exceedingly likely to have such a thing in her keeping.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho is that\u201d\n\n\u201cMadame Daubreuil\u201d said the detective dryly.",
    "\u201cEh eh\u201d said the magistrate his face falling a little \u201cso you have heard about that have you\u201d\n\n\u201cI hear everything\u201d said Giraud imperturbably.",
    "\u201cThere is one thing I could swear you have not heard\u201d said M. Hautet delighted to be able to show superior knowledge and without more ado he retailed the story of the mysterious visitor the night before.",
    "He also touched on the cheque made out to \u201cDuveen\u201d and finally handed Giraud the letter signed \u201cBella.\u201d\n\nGiraud listened in silence studied the letter attentively and then handed it back.",
    "\u201cAll very interesting M. le juge.",
    "But my theory remains unaffected.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd your theory is\u201d\n\n\u201cFor the moment I prefer not to say.",
    "Remember I am only just beginning my investigations.\u201d\n\n\u201cTell me one thing M. Giraud\u201d said Poirot suddenly.",
    "\u201cYour theory allows for the door being opened.",
    "It does not explain why it was left open.",
    "When they departed would it not have been natural for them to close it behind them.",
    "If a sergent de ville had chanced to come up to the house as is sometimes done to see that all is well they might have been discovered and overtaken almost at once.\u201d\n\n\u201cBah They forgot it.",
    "A mistake I grant you.\u201d\n\nThen to my surprise Poirot uttered almost the same words as he had uttered to Bex the previous evening\n\n\u201cI do not agree with you.",
    "The door being left open was the result of either design or necessity and any theory that does not admit that fact is bound to prove vain.\u201d\n\nWe all regarded the little man with a good deal of astonishment.",
    "The confession of ignorance drawn from him over the match end had I thought been bound to humiliate him but here he was self satisfied as ever laying down the law to the great Giraud without a tremor.",
    "The detective twisted his moustache eyeing my friend in a somewhat bantering fashion.",
    "\u201cYou don\u2019t agree with me eh Well what strikes you particularly about the case.",
    "Let\u2019s hear your views.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne thing presents itself to me as being significant.",
    "Tell me M. Giraud does nothing strike you as familiar about this case Is there nothing it reminds you of\u201d\n\n\u201cFamiliar Reminds me of I can\u2019t say offhand.",
    "I don\u2019t think so though.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are wrong\u201d said Poirot quietly.",
    "\u201cA crime almost precisely similar has been committed before.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen And where\u201d\n\n\u201cAh that unfortunately I cannot for the moment remember\u2014but I shall do so.",
    "I had hoped you might be able to assist me.\u201d\n\nGiraud snorted incredulously.",
    "\u201cThere have been many affairs of masked men I cannot remember the details of them all.",
    "These crimes all resemble each other more or less.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is such a thing as the individual touch.\u201d Poirot suddenly assumed his lecturing manner and addressed us collectively.",
    "\u201cI am speaking to you now of the psychology of crime.",
    "M. Giraud knows quite well that each criminal has his particular method and that the police when called in to investigate\u2014say a case of burglary\u2014can often make a shrewd guess at the offender simply by the peculiar method he has employed.",
    "Japp would tell you the same Hastings.",
    "Man is an unoriginal animal.",
    "Unoriginal within the law in his daily respectable life equally unoriginal outside the law.",
    "If a man commits a crime any other crime he commits will resemble it closely.",
    "The English murderer who disposed of his wives in succession by drowning them in their baths was a case in point.",
    "Had he varied his methods he might have escaped detection to this day.",
    "But he obeyed the common dictates of human nature arguing that what had once succeeded would succeed again and he paid the penalty of his lack of originality.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the point of all this\u201d sneered Giraud.",
    "\u201cThat when you have two crimes precisely similar in design and execution you find the same brain behind them both.",
    "I am looking for that brain M. Giraud\u2014and I shall find it.",
    "Here we have a true clue\u2014a psychological clue.",
    "You may know all about cigarettes and match ends M. Giraud but I Hercule Poirot know the mind of man\u201d And the ridiculous little fellow tapped his forehead with emphasis.",
    "Giraud remained singularly unimpressed.",
    "\u201cFor your guidance\u201d continued Poirot \u201cI will also advise you of one fact which might fail to be brought to your notice.",
    "The wrist watch of Madame Renauld on the day following the tragedy had gained two hours.",
    "It might interest you to examine it.\u201d\n\nGiraud stared.",
    "\u201cPerhaps it was in the habit of gaining\u201d\n\n\u201cAs a matter of fact I am told it did.\u201d\n\n\u201cEh bien then\u201d\n\n\u201cAll the same two hours is a good deal\u201d said Poirot softly.",
    "\u201cThen there is the matter of the footprints in the flowerbed.\u201d\n\nHe nodded his head towards the open window.",
    "Giraud took two eager strides and looked out.",
    "\u201cThis bed here\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I see no footprints\u201d\n\n\u201cNo\u201d said Poirot straightening a little pile of books on a table.",
    "\u201cThere are none.\u201d\n\nFor a moment an almost murderous rage obscured Giraud\u2019s face.",
    "He took two strides towards his tormentor but at that moment the salon door was opened and Marchaud announced.",
    "\u201cM.",
    "Stonor the secretary has just arrived from England.",
    "May he enter\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n10\n\nGabriel Stonor\n\n\nThe man who entered the room was a striking figure.",
    "Very tall with a well knit athletic frame and a deeply bronzed face and neck he dominated the assembly.",
    "Even Giraud seemed anaemic beside him.",
    "When I knew him better I realized that Gabriel Stonor was quite an unusual personality.",
    "English by birth he had knocked about all over the world.",
    "He had shot big game in Africa travelled in Korea ranched in California and traded in the South Sea Islands.",
    "He had been secretary to a New York railway magnate and had spent a year encamped in the desert with a friendly tribe of Arabs.",
    "His unerring eye picked out M. Hautet.",
    "\u201cThe examining magistrate in charge of the case Pleased to meet you M. le juge.",
    "This is a terrible business.",
    "How\u2019s Mrs. Renauld Is she bearing up fairly well It must have been an awful shock to her.\u201d\n\n\u201cTerrible terrible\u201d said M. Hautet.",
    "\u201cPermit me to introduce M. Bex\u2014our commissary of police M. Giraud of the S\u00fbret\u00e9.",
    "This gentleman is M. Hercule Poirot.",
    "M. Renauld sent for him but he arrived too late to do anything to avert the tragedy.",
    "A friend of M. Poirot\u2019s Captain Hastings.\u201d\n\nStonor looked at Poirot with some interest.",
    "\u201cSent for you did he\u201d\n\n\u201cYou did not know then that M. Renauld contemplated calling in a detective\u201d interposed M. Bex.",
    "\u201cNo I didn\u2019t.",
    "But it doesn\u2019t surprise me a bit.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause the old man was rattled I don\u2019t know what it was all about.",
    "He didn\u2019t confide in me.",
    "We weren\u2019t on those terms.",
    "But rattled he was\u2014and badly\u201d\n\n\u201cH\u2019m\u201d said M. Hautet.",
    "\u201cBut you have no notion of the cause\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I said sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will pardon me M. Stonor but we must begin with a few formalities.",
    "Your name\u201d\n\n\u201cGabriel Stonor.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow long ago was it that you became secretary to M. Renauld\u201d\n\n\u201cAbout two years ago when he first arrived from South America.",
    "I met him through a mutual friend and he offered me the post.",
    "A thundering good boss he was too.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid he talk to you much about his life in South America\u201d\n\n\u201cYes a good bit.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you know if he was ever in Santiago\u201d\n\n\u201cSeveral times I believe.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe never mentioned any special incident that occurred there\u2014anything that might have provoked some vendetta against him\u201d\n\n\u201cNever.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid he speak of any secret that he had acquired whilst sojourning there\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid he ever say anything at all about a secret\u201d\n\n\u201cNot that I can remember.",
    "But for all that there was a mystery about him.",
    "I\u2019ve never heard him speak of his boyhood for instance or of any incident prior to his arrival in South America.",
    "He was a French Canadian by birth I believe but I\u2019ve never heard him speak of his life in Canada.",
    "He could shut up like a clam if he liked.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo as far as you know he had no enemies and you can give us no clue as to any secret to obtain possession of which he might have been murdered\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s so.\u201d\n\n\u201cM.",
    "Stonor have you ever heard the name of Duveen in connection with M. Renauld\u201d\n\n\u201cDuveen.",
    "Duveen.\u201d He tried the name over thoughtfully.",
    "\u201cI don\u2019t think I have.",
    "And yet it seems familiar.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you know a lady a friend of M. Renauld\u2019s whose Christian name is Bella\u201d\n\nAgain Mr. Stonor shook his head.",
    "\u201cBella Duveen Is that the full name It\u2019s curious I\u2019m sure I know it.",
    "But for the moment I can\u2019t remember in what connection.\u201d\n\nThe magistrate coughed.",
    "\u201cYou understand M. Stonor\u2014the case is like this.",
    "There must be no reservations.",
    "You might perhaps through a feeling of consideration for Madame Renauld\u2014for whom I gather you have a great esteem and affection you might\u2014enfin\u201d said M. Hautet getting rather tied up in his sentence \u201cthere must absolutely be no reservations.\u201d\n\nStonor stared at him a dawning light of comprehension in his eyes.",
    "\u201cI don\u2019t quite get you\u201d he said gently.",
    "\u201cWhere does Mrs. Renauld come in I\u2019ve an immense respect and affection for that lady she\u2019s a very wonderful and unusual type but I don\u2019t quite see how my reservations or otherwise could affect her\u201d\n\n\u201cNot if this Bella Duveen should prove to have been something more than a friend to her husband\u201d\n\n\u201cAh\u201d said Stonor.",
    "\u201cI get you now.",
    "But I\u2019ll bet my bottom dollar that you\u2019re wrong.",
    "The old man never so much as looked at a petticoat.",
    "He just adored his own wife.",
    "They were the most devoted couple I know.\u201d\n\nM. Hautet shook his head gently.",
    "\u201cM.",
    "Stonor we hold absolute proof\u2014a love letter written by this Bella to M. Renauld accusing him of having tired of her.",
    "Moreover we have further proof that at the time of his death he was carrying on an intrigue with a Frenchwoman a Madame Daubreuil who rents the adjoining Villa.",
    "And this is the man who according to you never looked at a petticoat\u201d\n\nThe secretary\u2019s eyes narrowed.",
    "\u201cHold on M. le juge.",
    "You\u2019re barking up the wrong tree.",
    "I knew Paul Renauld.",
    "What you\u2019ve just been saying is utterly impossible.",
    "There\u2019s some other explanation.\u201d\n\nThe magistrate shrugged his shoulders.",
    "\u201cWhat other explanation could there be\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat leads you to think it was a love affair\u201d\n\n\u201cMadame Daubreuil was in the habit of visiting him here in the evenings.",
    "Also since M. Renauld came to the Villa Genevi\u00e8ve Madame Daubreuil has paid large sums of money into the bank in notes.",
    "In all the amount totals four thousand pounds of your English money.\u201d\n\n\u201cI guess that\u2019s right\u201d said Stonor quietly.",
    "\u201cI transmitted him those sums at his request.",
    "But it wasn\u2019t an intrigue.\u201d\n\n\u201cEh mon Dieu What else could it be\u201d\n\n\u201cBlackmail\u201d said Stonor sharply bringing down his hand with a slam on the table.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s what it was.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh Voil\u00e0 une id\u00e9e\u201d cried the magistrate shaken in spite of himself.",
    "\u201cBlackmail\u201d repeated Stonor.",
    "\u201cThe old man was being bled\u2014and at a good rate too.",
    "Four thousand in a couple of months.",
    "Whew I told you just now there was a mystery about Renauld.",
    "Evidently this Madame Daubreuil knew enough of it to put the screws on.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is possible\u201d the commissary cried excitedly.",
    "\u201cDecidedly it is possible.\u201d\n\n\u201cPossible\u201d roared Stonor.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s certain Tell me have you asked Mrs. Renauld about this love affair stunt of yours\u201d\n\n\u201cNo monsieur.",
    "We did not wish to occasion her any distress if it could reasonably be avoided.\u201d\n\n\u201cDistress Why she\u2019d laugh in your face.",
    "I tell you she and Renauld were a couple in a hundred.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh that reminds me of another point\u201d said M. Hautet.",
    "\u201cDid M. Renauld take you into his confidence at all as to the dispositions of his will\u201d\n\n\u201cI know all about it\u2014took it to the lawyer for him after he\u2019d drawn it out.",
    "I can give you the name of his solicitors if you want to see it.",
    "They\u2019ve got it there.",
    "Quite simple.",
    "Half in trust to his wife for her lifetime the other half to his son.",
    "A few legacies.",
    "I rather think he left me a thousand.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen was this will drawn up\u201d\n\n\u201cOh about a year and a half ago.\u201d\n\n\u201cWould it surprise you very much M. Stonor to hear that M. Renauld had made another will less than a fortnight ago\u201d\n\nStonor was obviously very much surprised.",
    "\u201cI\u2019d no idea of it.",
    "What\u2019s it like\u201d\n\n\u201cThe whole of his vast fortune is left unreservedly to his wife.",
    "There is no mention of his son.\u201d\n\nMr. Stonor gave vent to a prolonged whistle.",
    "\u201cI call that rather rough on the lad.",
    "His mother adores him of course but to the world at large it looks rather like a want of confidence on his father\u2019s part.",
    "It will be rather galling to his pride.",
    "Still it all goes to prove what I told you that Renauld and his wife were on first rate terms.\u201d\n\n\u201cQuite so quite so\u201d said M. Hautet.",
    "\u201cIt is possible we shall have to revise our ideas on several points.",
    "We have of course cabled to Santiago and are expecting a reply from there any minute.",
    "In all possibility everything will then be perfectly clear and straightforward.",
    "On the other hand if your suggestion of blackmail is true Madame Daubreuil ought to be able to give us valuable information.\u201d\n\nPoirot interjected a remark\n\n\u201cM.",
    "Stonor the English chauffeur Masters had he been long with M. Renauld\u201d\n\n\u201cOver a year\u201d\n\n\u201cHave you any idea whether he has ever been in South America\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m quite sure he hasn\u2019t.",
    "Before coming to Mr. Renauld he had been for many years with some people in Gloucestershire whom I know well.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn fact you can answer for him as being above suspicion\u201d\n\n\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d\n\nPoirot seemed somewhat crestfallen.",
    "Meanwhile the magistrate had summoned Marchaud.",
    "\u201cMy compliments to Madame Renauld and I should be glad to speak to her for a few minutes.",
    "Beg her not to disturb herself.",
    "I will wait upon her upstairs.\u201d\n\nMarchaud saluted and disappeared.",
    "We waited some minutes and then to our surprise the door opened and Mrs. Renauld deathly pale in her heavy mourning entered the room.",
    "M. Hautet brought forward a chair uttering vigorous protestations and she thanked him with a smile.",
    "Stonor was holding one hand of hers in his with an eloquent sympathy.",
    "Words evidently failed him.",
    "Mrs. Renauld turned to M. Hautet.",
    "\u201cYou wished to ask me something M. le juge.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith your permission madame.",
    "I understand your husband was a French Canadian by birth.",
    "Can you tell me anything of his youth or upbringing\u201d\n\nShe shook her head.",
    "\u201cMy husband was always very reticent about himself monsieur.",
    "He came from the North West I know but I fancy that he had an unhappy childhood for he never cared to speak of that time.",
    "Our life was lived entirely in the present and the future.\u201d\n\n\u201cWas there any mystery in his past life\u201d\n\nMrs. Renauld smiled a little and shook her head.",
    "\u201cNothing so romantic I am sure M. le juge.\u201d\n\nM. Hautet also smiled.",
    "\u201cTrue we must not permit ourselves to get melodramatic.",
    "There is one thing more\u2014\u201d he hesitated.",
    "Stonor broke in impetuously\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve got an extraordinary idea into their heads Mrs. Renauld.",
    "They actually fancy that Mr. Renauld was carrying on an intrigue with a Madame Daubreuil who it seems lives next door.\u201d\n\nThe scarlet colour flamed into Mrs. Renauld\u2019s cheeks.",
    "She flung her head up then bit her lip her face quivering.",
    "Stonor stood looking at her in astonishment but M. Bex leaned forward and said gently \u201cWe regret to cause you pain madame but have you any reason to believe that Madame Daubreuil was your husband\u2019s mistress\u201d\n\nWith a sob of anguish Mrs. Renauld buried her face in her hands.",
    "Her shoulders heaved convulsively.",
    "At last she lifted her head and said brokenly\n\n\u201cShe may have been.\u201d\n\nNever in all my life have I seen anything to equal the blank amazement on Stonor\u2019s face.",
    "He was thoroughly taken aback.",
    "11\n\nJack Renauld\n\n\nWhat the next development of the conversation would have been I cannot say for at that moment the door was thrown violently open and a tall young man strode into the room.",
    "Just for a moment I had the uncanny sensation that the dead man had come to life again.",
    "Then I realized that this dark head was untouched with grey and that in point of fact it was a mere boy who now burst in among us with so little ceremony.",
    "He went straight to Mrs. Renauld with an impetuosity that took no heed of the presence of others.",
    "\u201cMother\u201d\n\n\u201cJack\u201d With a cry she folded him in her arms.",
    "\u201cMy dearest But what brings you here You were to sail on the Anzora from Cherbourg two days ago\u201d Then suddenly recalling to herself the presence of others she turned with a certain dignity \u201cMy son messieurs.\u201d\n\n\u201cAha\u201d said M. Hautet acknowledging the young man\u2019s bow.",
    "\u201cSo you did not sail on the Anzora\u201d\n\n\u201cNo monsieur.",
    "As I was about to explain the Anzora was detained twentyfour hours through engine trouble.",
    "I should have sailed last night instead of the night before but happening to buy an evening paper I saw in it an account of the\u2014the awful tragedy that had befallen us\u2014\u201d His voice broke and the tears came into his eyes.",
    "\u201cMy poor father\u2014my poor poor father.\u201d\n\nStaring at him like one in a dream Mrs. Renauld repeated \u201cSo you did not sail\u201d And then with a gesture of infinite weariness she murmured as though to herself \u201cAfter all it does not matter\u2014now.\u201d\n\n\u201cSit down M. Renauld I beg of you\u201d said M. Hautet indicating a chair.",
    "\u201cMy sympathy for you is profound.",
    "It must have been a terrible shock to you to learn the news as you did.",
    "However it is most fortunate that you were prevented from sailing.",
    "I am in hopes that you may be able to give us just the information we need to clear up this mystery.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am at your disposal M. le juge.",
    "Ask me any questions you please.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo begin with I understand that this journey was being undertaken at your father\u2019s request\u201d\n\n\u201cQuite so M. le juge.",
    "I received a telegram bidding me to proceed without delay to Buenos Ayres and from thence via the Andes to Valparaiso and on to Santiago.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh.",
    "And the object of this journey\u201d\n\n\u201cI have no idea M. le juge.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.",
    "See here is the telegram.\u201d\n\nThe magistrate took it and read it aloud.",
    "\u201c\u200a\u2018Proceed immediately Cherbourg embark Anzora sailing tonight Buenos Ayres.",
    "Ultimate destination Santiago.",
    "Further instructions will await you Buenos Ayres.",
    "Do not fail.",
    "Matter is of utmost importance.",
    "Renauld.\u2019 And there had been no previous correspondence on the matter\u201d\n\nJack Renauld shook his head.",
    "\u201cThat is the only intimation of any kind.",
    "I knew of course that my father having lived so long out there had necessarily many interests in South America.",
    "But he had never mooted any suggestion of sending me out.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have of course been a good deal in South America M. Renauld\u201d\n\n\u201cI was there as a child.",
    "But I was educated in England and spent most of my holidays in that country so I really know far less of South America than might be supposed.",
    "You see the war broke out when I was seventeen.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou served in the English Flying Corps did you not\u201d\n\n\u201cYes M. le juge.\u201d\n\nM. Hautet nodded his head and proceeded with his inquiries along the by now wellknown lines.",
    "In response Jack Renauld declared definitely that he knew nothing of any enmity his father might have incurred in the city of Santiago or elsewhere in the South American continent that he had noticed no change in his father\u2019s manner of late and that he had never heard him refer to a secret.",
    "He had regarded the mission to South America as connected with business interests.",
    "As M. Hautet paused for a minute the quiet voice of Giraud broke in.",
    "\u201cI should like to put a few questions on my own account M. le juge.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy all means M. Giraud if you wish\u201d said the magistrate coldly.",
    "Giraud edged his chair a little nearer to the table.",
    "\u201cWere you on good terms with your father M. Renauld\u201d\n\n\u201cCertainly I was\u201d returned the lad haughtily.",
    "\u201cYou assert that positively\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo little disputes eh\u201d\n\nJack shrugged his shoulders.",

    "But I should prefer you to marry an Englishwoman or if a Frenchwoman not one who has a mother of doubtful antecedents\u201d\n\nHer rancour against the older woman showed plainly in her voice and I could well understand that it must have been a bitter blow to her when her only son showed signs of falling in love with the daughter of her rival.",
    "Mrs. Renauld continued addressing the magistrate\n\n\u201cI ought perhaps to have spoken to my husband on the subject but I hoped that it was only a boy and girl flirtation which would blow over all the quicker if no notice was taken of it.",

    "The whole thing must be given up.",
    "The injustice and highhandedness of it all maddened me\u2014especially since he himself always seemed to go out of his way to be attentive to the Daubreuils and was always suggesting that they should be asked to the house.",
    "I lost my head and we quarrelled in earnest.",
    "My father reminded me that I was entirely dependent on him and it must have been in answer to that that I made the remark about doing as I pleased after his death\u2014\u201d\n\nPoirot interrupted with a quick question.",

    "\u201cYes.",

    "What do you think M. Giraud It does not seem to lead us anywhere.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt certainly does not\u201d agreed the detective with emphasis.",
    "\u201cAnd yet\u201d sighed the magistrate \u201cit promised at the beginning to be such a beautiful and simple case\u201d He caught Mrs. Renauld\u2019s eye and blushed in immediate confusion.",
    "\u201cAh yes\u201d he coughed turning over the papers on the table.",
    "\u201cLet me see where were we Oh the weapon.",

    "Sharp and easy to handle.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere is it Can I see it Is it still in the\u2014the body\u201d\n\n\u201cOh no it had been removed.",

    "I will fetch it immediately.\u201d\n\n\u201cWould it not be better to take M. Renauld to the shed\u201d suggested Giraud smoothly.",
    "\u201cWithout doubt he would wish to see his father\u2019s body.\u201d\n\nThe boy made a shivering gesture of negation and the magistrate always disposed to cross Giraud whenever possible replied.",
    "\u201cBut no\u2014not at present.",
    "M. Bex will be so kind as to bring it to us here.\u201d\n\nThe commissary left the room.",
    "Stonor crossed to Jack and wrung him by the hand.",
    "Poirot had risen and was adjusting a pair of candlesticks that struck his trained eye as being a shade askew.",

    "It is altogether most irregular.",
    "You should not have permitted yourself this folly.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know\u201d I said meekly.",
    "\u201cNothing that you can say could be too severe M. le juge.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou did not invite this lady to come here\u201d\n\n\u201cCertainly not.",

    "She is an English lady who happens to be staying in Merlinville though I was not aware of that until my unexpected meeting with her.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell well\u201d said the magistrate softening.",
    "\u201cIt was most irregular but the lady is without doubt young and beautiful n\u2019estce pas What it is to be young O jeunesse jeunesse\u201d And he sighed sentimentally.",
    "But the commissary less romantic and more practical took up the tale\n\n\u201cBut did not you reclose and lock the door when you departed.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just it\u201d I said slowly.",

    "My friend was upset at the sight.",
    "She nearly fainted.",

    "In the excitement I forgot to relock the door.",
    "I only did so when I got back to the Villa.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen for twenty minutes at least\u2014\u201d said the commissary slowly.",

    "\u201cExactly\u201d I said.",
    "\u201cTwenty minutes\u201d mused the commissary.",
    "\u201cIt is deplorable\u201d said M. Hautet his sternness of manner returning.",
    "\u201cWithout precedent.\u201d\n\nSuddenly another voice spoke.",
    "\u201cYou find it deplorable M. le juge\u201d asked Giraud.",
    "\u201cCertainly I do.\u201d\n\n\u201cEh bien I find it admirable\u201d said the other imperturbably.",
    "This unexpected ally quite bewildered me.",
    "\u201cAdmirable M. Giraud\u201d asked the magistrate studying him cautiously out of the corner of his eye.",
    "\u201cPrecisely.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd why\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause we know now that the assassin or an accomplice of the assassin has been near the Villa only an hour ago.",
    "It will be strange if with that knowledge we do not shortly lay hands upon him.\u201d There was a note of menace in his voice.",
    "He continued \u201cHe risked a good deal to gain possession of that dagger.",
    "Perhaps he feared that fingerprints might be discovered on it.\u201d\n\nPoirot turned to Bex.",
    "\u201cYou said there were none\u201d\n\nGiraud shrugged his shoulders.",
    "\u201cPerhaps he could not be sure.\u201d\n\nPoirot looked at him.",
    "\u201cYou are wrong M. Giraud.",
    "The assassin wore gloves.",
    "So he must have been sure.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do not say it was the assassin himself.",
    "It may have been an accomplice who was not aware of that fact.\u201d\n\n\u201cIls sont mal renseign\u00e9s les accomplices\u201d muttered Poirot but he said no more.",
    "The magistrate\u2019s clerk was gathering up the papers on the table.",
    "M. Hautet addressed us\n\n\u201cOur work here is finished.",
    "Perhaps M. Renauld you will listen whilst your evidence is read over to you.",
    "I have purposely kept all the proceedings as informal as possible.",
    "I have been called original in my methods but I maintain that there is much to be said for originality.",
    "The case is now in the clever hands of the renowned M. Giraud.",
    "He will without doubt distinguish himself.",

    "Messieurs I wish you all good day.\u201d And accompanied by his clerk and the commissary he took his departure.",
    "Poirot tugged out that large turnip of a watch of his and observed the time.",

    "\u201cAnd you shall recount to me in full the indiscretions of this morning.",
    "No one is observing us.",
    "We need make no adieux.\u201d\n\nWe went quietly out of the room.",
    "The examining magistrate had just driven off in his car.",
    "I was going down the steps when Poirot\u2019s voice arrested me\n\n\u201cOne little moment my friend.\u201d Dexterously he whipped out his yard measure and proceeded quite solemnly to measure an overcoat hanging in the hall from the collar to the hem.",
    "I had not seen it hanging there before and guessed that it belonged to either Mr. Stonor or Jack Renauld.",
    "Then with a little satisfied grunt Poirot returned the measure to his pocket and followed me out into the open air.",
    "12\n\nPoirot Elucidates Certain Points\n\n\n\u201cWhy did you measure that overcoat\u201d I asked with some curiosity as we walked down the hot white road at a leisurely pace.",
    "\u201cParbleu to see how long it was\u201d replied my friend imperturbably.",
    "I was vexed.",
    "Poirot\u2019s incurable habit of making a mystery out of nothing never failed to irritate me.",
    "I relapsed into silence and followed a train of thought of my own.",
    "Although I had not noticed them specially at the time certain words Mrs. Renauld had addressed to her son now recurred to me fraught with a new significance.",
    "\u201cSo you did not sail\u201d she had said and then had added \u201cAfter all it does not matter\u2014now.\u201d\n\nWhat had she meant by that The words were enigmatical\u2014significant.",
    "Was it possible that she knew more than we supposed She had denied all knowledge of the mysterious mission with which her husband was to have entrusted his son.",
    "But was she really less ignorant than she pretended Could she enlighten us if she chose and was her silence part of a carefully thought out and preconceived plan\n\nThe more I thought about it the more I was convinced that I was right.",
    "Mrs. Renauld knew more than she chose to tell.",
    "In her surprise at seeing her son she had momentarily betrayed herself.",
    "I felt convinced that she knew if not the assassins at least the motive for the assassination.",
    "But some very powerful considerations must keep her silent.",
    "\u201cYou think profoundly my friend\u201d remarked Poirot breaking in upon my reflections.",
    "\u201cWhat is it that intrigues you so\u201d\n\nI told him sure of my ground though feeling expectant that he would ridicule my suspicions.",
    "But to my surprise he nodded thoughtfully.",
    "\u201cYou are quite right Hastings.",
    "From the beginning I have been sure that she was keeping something back.",
    "At first I suspected her if not of inspiring at least of conniving at the crime.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou suspected her\u201d I cried.",
    "\u201cBut certainly She benefits enormously\u2014in fact by this new will she is the only person to benefit.",
    "So from the start she was singled out for attention.",
    "You may have noticed that I took an early opportunity of examining her wrists.",
    "I wished to see whether there was any possibility that she had gagged and bound herself.",
    "Eh bien I saw at once that there was no fake the cords had actually been drawn so tight as to cut into the flesh.",
    "That ruled out the possibility of her having committed the crime singlehanded.",
    "But it was still possible for her to have connived at it or to have been the instigator with an accomplice.",
    "Moreover the story as she told it was singularly familiar to me\u2014the masked men that she could not recognize the mention of \u2018the secret\u2019\u2014I had heard or read all these things before.",
    "Another little detail confirmed my belief that she was not speaking the truth.",
    "The wrist watch Hastings the wrist watch\u201d\n\nAgain that wrist watch Poirot was eyeing me curiously.",
    "\u201cYou see mon ami You comprehend\u201d\n\n\u201cNo\u201d I replied with some ill humour.",
    "\u201cI neither see nor comprehend.",
    "You make all these confounded mysteries and it\u2019s useless asking you to explain.",
    "You always like keeping everything up your sleeve to the last minute.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo not enrage yourself my friend\u201d said Poirot with a smile.",
    "\u201cI will explain if you wish.",
    "But not a word to Giraud c\u2019est entendu He treats me as an old one of no importance We shall see In common fairness I gave him a hint.",
    "If he does not choose to act upon it that is his own look out.\u201d\n\nI assured Poirot that he could rely upon my discretion.",
    "\u201cC\u2019est bien Let us then employ our little grey cells.",
    "Tell me my friend at what time according to you did the tragedy take place\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy at two o\u2019clock or thereabouts\u201d I said astonished.",
    "\u201cYou remember Mrs. Renauld told us that she heard the clock strike while the men were in the room.\u201d\n\n\u201cExactly and on the strength of that you the examining magistrate Bex and every one else accept the time without further question.",
    "But I Hercule Poirot say that Madame Renauld lied.",
    "The crime took place at least two hours earlier.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut the doctors\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThey declared after examination of the body that death had taken place between ten and seven hours previously.",
    "Mon ami for some reason it was imperative that the crime should seem to have taken place later than it actually did.",
    "You have read of a smashed watch or clock recording the exact hour of a crime So that the time should not rest on Mrs. Renauld\u2019s testimony alone some one moved on the hands of that wrist watch to two o\u2019clock and then dashed it violently to the ground.",
    "But as is often the case they defeated their own object.",
    "The glass was smashed but the mechanism of the watch was uninjured.",
    "It was a most disastrous manoeuvre on their part for it at once drew my attention to two points\u2014first that Madame Renauld was lying secondly that there must be some vital reason for the postponement of the time.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut what reason could there be\u201d\n\n\u201cAh that is the question There we have the whole mystery.",
    "As yet I cannot explain it.",
    "There is only one idea that presents itself to me as having a possible connection.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd that is\u201d\n\n\u201cThe last train left Merlinville at seventeen minutes past twelve.\u201d\n\nI followed it out slowly.",
    "\u201cSo that the crime apparently taking place some two hours later any one leaving by that train would have an unimpeachable alibi\u201d\n\n\u201cPerfect Hastings You have it\u201d\n\nI sprang up.",
    "\u201cBut we must inquire at the station.",
    "Surely they cannot have failed to notice two foreigners who left by that train We must go there at once\u201d\n\n\u201cYou think so Hastings\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course.",
    "Let us go there now.\u201d\n\nPoirot restrained my ardour with a light touch upon the arm.",
    "\u201cGo by all means if you wish mon ami\u2014but if you go I should not ask for particulars of two foreigners.\u201d\n\nI stared and he said rather impatiently\n\n\u201cL\u00e0 l\u00e0 you do not believe all that rigmarole do you The masked men and all the rest of cette histoirel\u00e0\u201d\n\nHis words took me so much aback that I hardly knew how to respond.",
    "He went on serenely\n\n\u201cYou heard me say to Giraud did you not that all the details of this crime were familiar to me Eh bien that presupposes one of two things either the brain that planned the first crime also planned this one or else an account read of a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre unconsciously remained in our assassin\u2019s memory and prompted the details.",
    "I shall be able to pronounce definitely on that after\u2014\u201d he broke off.",
    "I was revolving sundry matters in my mind.",
    "\u201cBut Mr. Renauld\u2019s letter It distinctly mentions a secret and Santiago\u201d\n\n\u201cUndoubtedly there was a secret in M. Renauld\u2019s life\u2014there can be no doubt of that.",
    "On the other hand the word Santiago to my mind is a red herring dragged continually across the track to put us off the scent.",
    "It is possible that it was used in the same way on M. Renauld to keep him from directing his suspicions into a quarter nearer at hand.",
    "Oh be assured Hastings the danger that threatened him was not in Santiago it was near at hand in France.\u201d\n\nHe spoke so gravely and with such assurance that I could not fail to be convinced.",
    "But I essayed one final objection\n\n\u201cAnd the match and cigarette end found near the body What of them.\u201d\n\nA light of pure enjoyment lit up Poirot\u2019s face.",
    "\u201cPlanted Deliberately planted there for Giraud or one of his tribe to find Ah he is smart Giraud he can do his tricks So can a good retriever dog.",
    "He comes in so pleased with himself.",
    "For hours he has crawled on his stomach.",
    "\u2018See what I have found\u2019 he says.",
    "And then again to me \u2018What do you see here\u2019 Me I answer with profound and deep truth \u2018Nothing.\u2019 And Giraud the great Giraud he laughs he thinks to himself \u2018Oh that he is imbecile this old one\u2019 But we shall see.",
    "\u2026\u201d\n\nBut my mind had reverted to the main facts.",
    "\u201cThen all this story of the masked men\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIs false.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat really happened\u201d\n\nPoirot shrugged his shoulders.",
    "\u201cOne person could tell us\u2014Madame Renauld.",
    "But she will not speak.",
    "Threats and entreaties would not move her.",
    "A remarkable woman that Hastings.",
    "I recognized as soon as I saw her that I had to deal with a woman of unusual character.",
    "At first as I told you I was inclined to suspect her of being concerned in the crime.",
    "Afterwards I altered my opinion.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat made you do that\u201d\n\n\u201cHer spontaneous and genuine grief at the sight of her husband\u2019s body.",
    "I could swear that the agony in that cry of hers was genuine.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes\u201d I said thoughtfully \u201cone cannot mistake these things.\u201d\n\n\u201cI beg your pardon my friend\u2014one can always be mistaken.",
    "Regard a great actress does not her acting of grief carry you away and impress you with its reality No however strong my own impression and belief I needed other evidence before I allowed myself to be satisfied.",
    "The great criminal can be a great actor.",
    "I base my certainty in this case not upon my own impression but upon the undeniable fact that Mrs. Renauld actually fainted.",
    "I turned up her eyelids and felt her pulse.",
    "There was no deception\u2014the swoon was genuine.",
    "Therefore I was satisfied that her anguish was real and not assumed.",
    "Besides a small additional point not without interest it was unnecessary for Mrs. Renauld to exhibit unrestrained grief.",
    "She had had one paroxysm on learning of her husband\u2019s death and there would be no need for her to simulate another such a violent one on beholding his body.",
    "No Mrs. Renauld was not her husband\u2019s murderess.",
    "But why has she lied She lied about the wrist watch she lied about the masked men\u2014she lied about a third thing.",
    "Tell me Hastings what is your explanation of the open door\u201d\n\n\u201cWell\u201d I said rather embarrassed \u201cI suppose it was an oversight.",
    "They forgot to shut it.\u201d\n\nPoirot shook his head and sighed.",
    "\u201cThat is the explanation of Giraud.",
    "It does not satisfy me.",
    "There is a meaning behind that open door which for a moment I cannot fathom.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have an idea\u201d I cried suddenly.",
    "\u201cA la bonne heure Let us hear it.\u201d\n\n\u201cListen.",
    "We are agreed that Mrs. Renauld\u2019s story is a fabrication.",
    "Is it not possible then that Mr. Renauld left the house to keep an appointment\u2014possibly with the murderer\u2014leaving the front door open for his return.",
    "But he did not return and the next morning he is found stabbed in the back.\u201d\n\n\u201cAn admirable theory Hastings but for two facts which you have characteristically overlooked.",
    "In the first place who gagged and bound Madame Renauld And why on earth should they return to the house to do so In the second place no man on earth would go out to keep an appointment wearing his underclothes and an overcoat.",
    "There are circumstances in which a man might wear pajamas and an overcoat\u2014but the other never\u201d\n\n\u201cTrue\u201d I said rather crestfallen.",
    "\u201cNo\u201d continued Poirot \u201cwe must look elsewhere for a solution of the open door mystery.",
    "One thing I am fairly sure of\u2014they did not leave through the door.",
    "They left by the window.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u201d\n\n\u201cPrecisely.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut there were no footmarks in the flower bed underneath.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo\u2014and there ought to have been.",
    "Listen Hastings.",
    "The gardener Auguste as you heard him say planted both those beds the preceding afternoon.",
    "In the one there are plentiful impressions of his big hobnailed boots\u2014in the other none You see Some one had passed that way some one who to obliterate their footprints smoothed over the surface of the bed with a rake.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere did they get a rake\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere they got the spade and the gardening gloves\u201d said Poirot impatiently.",
    "\u201cThere is no difficulty about that.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat makes you think that they left that way though Surely it is more probable that they entered by the window and left by the door.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is possible of course.",
    "Yet I have a strong idea that they left by the window.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think you are wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cPerhaps mon ami.\u201d\n\nI mused thinking over the new field of conjecture that Poirot\u2019s deductions had opened up to me.",
    "I recalled my wonder at his cryptic allusions to the flower bed and the wrist watch.",
    "His remarks had seemed so meaningless at the moment and now for the first time I realized how remarkably from a few slight incidents he had unravelled much of the mystery that surrounded the case.",
    "I paid a belated homage to my friend.",
    "As though he read my thoughts he nodded sagely.",
    "\u201cMethod you comprehend Method Arrange your facts.",
    "Arrange your ideas.",
    "And if some little fact will not fit in\u2014do not reject it but consider it closely.",
    "Though its significance escapes you be sure that it is significant.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the meantime\u201d I said considering \u201calthough we know a great deal more than we did we are no nearer to solving the mystery of who killed Mr. Renauld.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo\u201d said Poirot cheerfully.",
    "\u201cIn fact we are a great deal further off.\u201d\n\nThe fact seemed to afford him such peculiar satisfaction that I gazed at him in wonder.",
    "He met my eye and smiled.",
    "\u201cBut yes it is better so.",
    "Before there was at all events a clear theory as to how and by whose hands he met his death.",
    "Now that is all gone.",
    "We are in darkness.",
    "A hundred conflicting points confuse and worry us.",
    "That is well.",
    "That is excellent.",
    "Out of confusion comes forth order.",
    "But if you find order to start with if a crime seems simple and aboveboard eh bien m\u00e9fiez vous It is how do you say it\u2014cooked The great criminal is simple\u2014but very few criminals are great.",
    "In trying to cover up their tracks they invariably betray themselves.",
    "Ah mon ami I would that some day I could meet a really great criminal\u2014one who commits his crime and then\u2014does nothing Even I Hercule Poirot might fail to catch such a one.\u201d\n\nBut I had not followed his words.",
    "A light had burst upon me.",
    "\u201cPoirot Mrs. Renauld I see it now.",
    "She must be shielding somebody.\u201d\n\nFrom the quietness with which Poirot received my remark I could see that the idea had already occurred to him.",
    "\u201cYes\u201d he said thoughtfully.",
    "\u201cShielding some one\u2014or screening some one.",
    "One of the two.\u201d\n\nI saw very little difference between the two words but I developed my theme with a good deal of earnestness.",
    "Poirot maintained a strictly noncommittal attitude repeating\n\n\u201cIt may be\u2014yes it may be.",
    "But as yet I do not know There is something very deep underneath all this.",
    "You will see.",
    "Something very deep.\u201d\n\nThen as we entered our hotel he enjoined silence on me with a gesture.",
    "13\n\nThe Girl with the Anxious Eyes\n\n\nWe lunched with an excellent appetite.",
    "I understood well enough that Poirot did not wish to discuss the tragedy where we could so easily be overheard.",
    "But as is usual when one topic fills the mind to the exclusion of everything else no other subject of interest seemed to present itself.",
    "For a while we ate in silence and then Poirot observed maliciously\n\n\u201cEh bien And your indiscretions You recount them not\u201d\n\nI felt myself blushing.",
    "\u201cOh you mean this morning\u201d I endeavoured to adopt a tone of absolute nonchalance.",
    "But I was no match for Poirot.",
    "In a very few minutes he had extracted the whole story from me his eyes twinkling as he did so.",
    "\u201cTiens A story of the most romantic.",
    "What is her name this charming young lady\u201d\n\nI had to confess that I did not know.",
    "\u201cStill more romantic The first rencontre in the train from Paris the second here.",
    "Journeys end in lovers\u2019 meetings is not that the saying\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be an ass Poirot.\u201d\n\n\u201cYesterday it was Mademoiselle Daubreuil today it is Mademoiselle\u2014Cinderella Decidedly you have the heart of a Turk Hastings You should establish a harem\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all very well to rag me.",
    "Mademoiselle Daubreuil is a very beautiful girl and I do admire her immensely\u2014I don\u2019t mind admitting it.",
    "The other\u2019s nothing\u2014don\u2019t suppose I shall ever see her again.",
    "She was quite amusing to talk to just for a railway journey but she\u2019s not the kind of girl I should ever get keen on.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy\u201d\n\n\u201cWell\u2014it sounds snobbish perhaps\u2014but she\u2019s not a lady not in any sense of the word.\u201d\n\nPoirot nodded thoughtfully.",
    "There was less raillery in his voice as he asked\n\n\u201cYou believe then in birth and breeding\u201d\n\n\u201cI may be oldfashioned but I certainly don\u2019t believe in marrying out of one\u2019s class.",
    "It never answers.\u201d\n\n\u201cI agree with you mon ami.",
    "Ninetynine times out of a hundred it is as you say.",
    "But there is always the hundredth time Still that does not arise as you do not propose to see the lady again.\u201d\n\nHis last words were almost a question and I was aware of the sharpness with which he darted a glance at me.",
    "And before my eyes writ large in letters of fire I saw the words \u201cH\u00f4tel du Phare\u201d and I heard again her voice saying \u201cCome and look me up\u201d and my own answering with empressement \u201cI will.\u201d\n\nWell what of it I had meant to go at the time.",
    "But since then I had had time to reflect.",
    "I did not like the girl.",
    "Thinking it over in cold blood I came definitely to the conclusion that I disliked her intensely.",
    "I had got hauled over the coals for foolishly gratifying her morbid curiosity and I had not the least wish to see her again.",
    "I answered Poirot lightly enough.",
    "\u201cShe asked me to look her up but of course I shan\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy \u2018of course\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cWell\u2014I don\u2019t want to.\u201d\n\n\u201cI see.\u201d He studied me attentively for some minutes.",
    "\u201cYes.",
    "I see very well.",
    "And you are wise.",
    "Stick to what you have said.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat seems to be your invariable advice\u201d I remarked rather piqued.",
    "\u201cAh my friend have faith in Papa Poirot.",
    "Some day if you permit I will arrange you a marriage of great suitability.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you\u201d I said laughing \u201cbut the prospect leaves me cold.\u201d\n\nPoirot sighed and shook his head.",
    "\u201cLes Anglais\u201d he murmured.",
    "\u201cNo method\u2014absolutely none whatever.",
    "They leave all to chance\u201d He frowned and altered the position of the salt cellar.",
    "\u201cMademoiselle Cinderella is staying at the H\u00f4tel d\u2019Angleterre you told me did you not\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.",
    "H\u00f4tel du Phare.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrue I forgot.\u201d\n\nA moment\u2019s misgiving shot across my mind.",
    "Surely I had never mentioned any hotel to Poirot.",
    "I looked across at him and felt reassured.",
    "He was cutting his bread into neat little squares completely absorbed in his task.",
    "He must have fancied I had told him where the girl was staying.",
    "We had coffee outside facing the sea.",
    "Poirot smoked one of his tiny cigarettes and then drew his watch from his pocket.",
    "\u201cThe train to Paris leaves at 225\u201d he observed.",
    "\u201cI should be starting.\u201d\n\n\u201cParis\u201d I cried.",
    "\u201cThat is what I said mon ami.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are going to Paris But why\u201d\n\nHe replied very seriously.",
    "\u201cTo look for the murderer of M. Renauld.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou think he is in Paris\u201d\n\n\u201cI am quite certain that he is not.",
    "Nevertheless it is there that I must look for him.",
    "You do not understand but I will explain it all to you in good time.",
    "Believe me this journey to Paris is necessary.",
    "I shall not be away long.",
    "In all probability I shall return tomorrow.",
    "I do not propose that you should accompany me.",
    "Remain here and keep an eye on Giraud.",
    "Also cultivate the society of M. Renauld fils.",
    "And thirdly if you wish endeavour to cut him out with Mademoiselle Marthe.",
    "But I fear you will not have great success.\u201d\n\nI did not quite relish the last remark.",
    "\u201cThat reminds me\u201d I said.",
    "\u201cI meant to ask you how you knew about those two\u201d\n\n\u201cMon ami\u2014I know human nature.",
    "Throw together a boy young Renauld and a beautiful girl like Mademoiselle Marthe and the result is almost inevitable.",
    "Then the quarrel It was money or a woman and remembering L\u00e9onie\u2019s description of the lad\u2019s anger I decided on the latter.",
    "So I made my guess\u2014and I was right.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd that was why you warned me against setting my heart on the lady You already suspected that she loved young Renauld\u201d\n\nPoirot smiled.",
    "\u201cAt any rate\u2014I saw that she had anxious eyes.",
    "That is how always think of Mademoiselle Daubreuil as the girl with the anxious eyes.",
    "\u2026\u201d\n\nHis voice was so grave that it impressed me uncomfortably.",
    "\u201cWhat do you mean by that Poirot\u201d\n\n\u201cI fancy my friend that we shall see before very long.",
    "But I must start.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve oceans of time.\u201d\n\n\u201cPerhaps\u2014perhaps.",
    "But I like plenty of leisure at the station.",
    "I do not wish to rush to hurry to excite myself.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt all events\u201d I said rising \u201cI will come and see you off.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will do nothing of the sort.",
    "I forbid it.\u201d\n\nHe was so peremptory that I stared at him in surprise.",
    "He nodded emphatically.",
    "\u201cI mean it mon ami.",
    "Au revoir You permit that I embrace you Ah no I forget that it is not the English custom.",
    "Une poignee de main alors.\u201d\n\nI felt rather at a loose end after Poirot had left me.",
    "I strolled down the beach and watched the bathers without feeling energetic enough to join them.",
    "I rather fancied that Cinderella might be disporting herself amongst them in some wonderful costume but I saw no signs of her.",
    "I strolled aimlessly along the sands towards the further end of the town.",
    "It occurred to me that after all it would only be decent feeling on my part to inquire after the girl.",
    "And it would save trouble in the end.",
    "The matter would then be finished with.",
    "There would be no need for me to trouble about her any further.",
    "But if I did not go at all she might quite possibly come and look me up at the Villa.",
    "And that would be annoying in every way.",
    "Decidedly it would be better to pay a short call in the course of which I could make it quite clear that I could do nothing further for her in my capacity of showman.",
    "Accordingly I left the beach and walked inland.",
    "I soon found the H\u00f4tel du Phare a very unpretentious building.",
    "It was annoying in the extreme not to know the lady\u2019s name and to save my dignity I decided to stroll inside and look around.",
    "Probably I should find her in the lounge.",
    "Merlinville was a small place you left your hotel to go to the beach and you left the beach to return to the hotel.",
    "There were no other attractions.",
    "There was a Casino being built but it was not yet completed.",
    "I had walked the length of the beach without seeing her therefore she must be in the hotel.",
    "I went in.",
    "Several people were sitting in the tiny lounge but my quarry was not amongst them.",
    "I looked into some other rooms but there was no sign of her.",
    "I waited for some time till my impatience got the better of me.",
    "I took the concierge aside and slipped five francs into his hand.",
    "\u201cI wish to see a lady who is staying here.",
    "A young English lady small and dark.",
    "I am not sure of her name.\u201d\n\nThe man shook his head and seemed to be suppressing a grin.",
    "\u201cThere is no such lady as you describe staying here.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe is American possibly\u201d I suggested.",
    "These fellows are so stupid.",
    "But the man continued to shake his head.",
    "\u201cNo monsieur.",
    "There are only six or seven English and American ladies altogether and they are all much older than the lady you are seeking.",
    "It is not here that you will find her monsieur.\u201d\n\nHe was so positive that I felt doubts.",
    "\u201cBut the lady told me she was staying here.\u201d\n\n\u201cMonsieur must have made a mistake\u2014or it is more likely the lady did since there has been another gentleman here inquiring for her.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is that you say\u201d I cried surprised.",
    "\u201cBut yes monsieur.",
    "A gentleman who described her just as you have done.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat was he like\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was a small gentleman well dressed very neat very spotless the moustache very stiff the head of a peculiar shape and the eyes green.\u201d\n\nPoirot So that was why he refused to let me accompany him to the station.",
    "The impertinence of it I would thank him not to meddle in my concerns.",
    "Did he fancy I needed a nurse to look after me Thanking the man I departed somewhat at a loss and still much incensed with my meddlesome friend.",
    "I regretted that he was for the moment out of reach.",
    "I should have enjoyed telling him what I thought of his unwarranted interference.",
    "Had I not distinctly told him that I had no intention of seeing the girl Decidedly one\u2019s friends can be too zealous\n\nBut where was the lady I set aside my wrath and tried to puzzle it out.",
    "Evidently through inadvertence she had named the wrong hotel.",
    "Then another thought struck me.",
    "Was it inadvertence Or had she deliberately withheld her name and given me the wrong address The more I thought about it the more I felt convinced that this last surmise of mine was right.",
    "For some reason or other she did not wish to let the acquaintance ripen into friendship.",
    "And though half an hour earlier this had been precisely my own view I did not enjoy having the tables turned upon me.",
    "The whole affair was profoundly unsatisfactory and I went up to the Villa Genevi\u00e8ve in a condition of distinct ill humour.",
    "I did not go to the house but went up the path to the little bench by the shed and sat there moodily enough.",
    "I was distracted from my thoughts by the sound of voices close at hand.",
    "In a second or two I realized that they came not from the garden I was in but from the adjoining garden of the Villa Marguerite and that they were approaching rapidly.",
    "A girl\u2019s voice was speaking a voice that I recognized as that of the beautiful Marthe.",
    "\u201cCh\u00e9ri\u201d she was saying \u201cis it really true Are all our troubles over.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know it Marthe\u201d Jack Renauld replied.",
    "\u201cNothing can part us now beloved.",
    "The last obstacle to our union is removed.",
    "Nothing can take you from me.\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing\u201d the girl murmured.",
    "\u201cOh Jack Jack\u2014I am afraid.\u201d\n\nI had moved to depart realizing that I was quite unintentionally eavesdropping.",
    "As I rose to my feet I caught sight of them through a gap in the hedge.",
    "They stood together facing me the man\u2019s arm round the girl his eyes looking into hers.",
    "They were a splendid looking couple the dark wellknit boy and the fair young goddess.",
    "They seemed made for each other as they stood there happy in spite of the terrible tragedy that overshadowed their young lives.",
    "But the girl\u2019s face was troubled and Jack Renauld seemed to recognize it as he held her closer to him and asked\n\n\u201cBut what are you afraid of darling What is there to fear\u2014now\u201d\n\nAnd then I saw the look in her eyes the look Poirot had spoken of as she murmured so that I almost guessed at the words.",
    "\u201cI am afraid\u2014for you.",
    "\u2026\u201d\n\nI did not hear young Renauld\u2019s answer for my attention was distracted by an unusual appearance a little further down the hedge.",
    "There appeared to be a brown bush there which seemed odd to say the least of it so early in the summer.",
    "I stepped along to investigate but at my advance the brown bush withdrew itself precipitately and faced me with a finger to its lips.",
    "It was Giraud.",
    "Enjoining caution he led the way round the shed until we were out of earshot.",
    "\u201cWhat were you doing there\u201d I asked.",
    "\u201cExactly what you were doing\u2014listening.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I was not there on purpose\u201d\n\n\u201cAh\u201d said Giraud.",
    "\u201cI was.\u201d\n\nAs always I admired the man whilst disliking him.",
    "He looked me up and down with a sort of contemptuous disfavour.",
    "\u201cYou didn\u2019t help matters by butting in.",
    "I might have heard something useful in a minute.",
    "What have you done with your old fossil\u201d\n\n\u201cM.",
    "Poirot has gone to Paris\u201d I replied coldly.",
    "\u201cAnd I can tell you M. Giraud that he is anything but an old fossil.",
    "He has solved many cases that have completely baffled the English police.\u201d\n\n\u201cBah The English police\u201d Giraud snapped his fingers disdainfully.",
    "\u201cThey must be on a level with our examining magistrates.",
    "So he has gone to Paris has he Well a good thing.",
    "The longer he stays there the better.",
    "But what does he think he will find there\u201d\n\nI thought I read in the question a tinge of uneasiness.",
    "I drew myself up.",
    "\u201cThat I am not at liberty to say\u201d I said quietly.",
    "Giraud subjected me to a piercing stare.",
    "\u201cHe has probably enough sense not to tell you\u201d he remarked rudely.",
    "\u201cGood afternoon.",
    "I\u2019m busy.\u201d\n\nAnd with that he turned on his heel and left me without ceremony.",
    "Matters seemed at a standstill at the Villa Genevi\u00e8ve.",
    "Giraud evidently did not desire my company and from what I had seen it seemed fairly certain that Jack Renauld did not either.",
    "I went back to the town had an enjoyable bath and returned to the hotel.",
    "I turned in early wondering whether the following day would bring forth anything of interest.",
    "I was wholly unprepared for what it did bring forth.",
    "I was eating my petit d\u00e9jeuner in the diningroom when the waiter who had been talking to some one outside came back in obvious excitement.",
    "He hesitated for a minute fidgeting with his napkin and then burst out.",
    "\u201cMonsieur will pardon me but he is connected is he not with the affair at the Villa Genevi\u00e8ve\u2019\n\n\u201cYes\u201d I said eagerly.",
    "\u201cWhy\u201d\n\n\u201cMonsieur has not heard the news though\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat news\u201d\n\n\u201cThat there has been another murder there last night\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u201d\n\nLeaving my breakfast I caught up my hat and ran as fast as I could.",
    "Another murder\u2014and Poirot away What fatality.",
    "But who had been murdered\n\nI dashed in at the gate.",
    "A group of the servants was in the drive talking and gesticulating.",
    "I caught hold of Fran\u00e7oise.",
    "\u201cWhat has happened\u201d\n\n\u201cOh monsieur monsieur Another death It is terrible.",
    "There is a curse upon the house.",
    "But yes I say it a curse They should send for M. le cur\u00e9 to bring some holy water.",
    "Never will I sleep another night under that roof.",
    "It might be my turn who knows\u201d\n\nShe crossed herself.",
    "\u201cYes\u201d I cried \u201cbut who has been killed\u201d\n\n\u201cDo I know\u2014me A man\u2014a stranger.",
    "They found him up there\u2014in the shed\u2014not a hundred yards from where they found poor Monsieur.",
    "And that is not all.",
    "He is stabbed\u2014stabbed to the heart with the same dagger\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n14\n\nThe Second Body\n\n\nWaiting for no more I turned and ran up the path to the shed.",
    "The two men on guard there stood aside to let me pass and filled with excitement I entered.",
    "The light was dim the place was a mere rough wooden erection to keep old pots and tools in.",
    "I had entered impetuously but on the threshold I checked myself fascinated by the spectacle before me.",
    "Giraud was on his hands and knees a pocket torch in his hand with which he was examining every inch of the ground.",
    "He looked up with a frown at my entrance then his face relaxed a little in a sort of goodhumoured contempt.",
    "\u201cAh c\u2019est l\u2019Anglais Enter then.",
    "Let us see what you can make of this affair.\u201d\n\nRather stung by his tone I stooped my head and passed in.",
    "\u201cThere he is\u201d said Giraud flashing his torch to the far corner.",
    "I stepped across.",
    "The dead man lay straight upon his back.",
    "He was of medium height swarthy of complexion and possibly about fifty years of age.",
    "He was neatly dressed in a dark blue suit well cut and probably made by an expensive tailor but not new.",
    "His face was terribly convulsed and on his left side just over the heart the hilt of a dagger stood up black and shining.",
    "I recognized it.",
    "It was the same dagger I had seen reposing in the glass jar the preceding morning\n\n\u201cI\u2019m expecting the doctor any minute\u201d explained Giraud.",
    "\u201cAlthough we hardly need him.",
    "There\u2019s no doubt what the man died of.",
    "He was stabbed to the heart and death must have been pretty well instantaneous.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen was it done Last night\u201d\n\nGiraud shook his head.",
    "\u201cHardly.",
    "I don\u2019t lay down the law on medical evidence but the man\u2019s been dead well over twelve hours.",
    "When do you say you last saw that dagger\u201d\n\n\u201cAbout ten o\u2019clock yesterday morning.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen I should be inclined to fix the crime as being done not long after that.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut people were passing and repassing this shed continually.\u201d\n\nGiraud laughed disagreeably.",
    "\u201cYou progress to a marvel Who told you he was killed in this shed\u201d\n\n\u201cWell\u2014\u201d I felt flustered.",
    "\u201cI\u2014I assumed it.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh what a fine detective Look at him mon petit\u2014does a man stabbed to the heart fall like that\u2014neatly with his feet together and his arms to his side No.",
    "Again does a man lie down on his back and permit himself to be stabbed without raising a hand to defend himself It is absurd is it not But see here\u2014and here\u2014\u201d He flashed the torch along the ground.",
    "I saw curious irregular marks in the soft dirt.",
    "\u201cHe was dragged here after he was dead.",
    "Half dragged half carried by two people.",
    "Their tracks do not show on the hard ground outside and here they have been careful to obliterate them\u2014but one of the two was a woman my young friend.\u201d\n\n\u201cA woman\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut if the tracks are obliterated how do you know\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause blurred as they are the prints of the woman\u2019s shoe are unmistakable.",
    "Also by this\u2014\u201d And leaning forward he drew something from the handle of the dagger and held it up for me to see.",
    "It was a woman\u2019s long black hair\u2014similar to the one Poirot had taken from the armchair in the library.",
    "With a slightly ironic smile he wound it round the dagger again.",
    "\u201cWe will leave things as they are as much as possible\u201d he explained.",
    "\u201cIt pleases the examining magistrate.",
    "Eh bien do you notice anything else\u201d\n\nI was forced to shake my head.",
    "\u201cLook at his hands.\u201d\n\nI did.",
    "The nails were broken and discoloured and the skin was hard.",
    "It hardly enlightened me as much as I should have liked it to have done.",
    "I looked up at Giraud.",
    "\u201cThey are not the hands of a gentleman\u201d he said answering my look.",
    "\u201cOn the contrary his clothes are those of a welltodo man.",
    "That is curious is it not\u201d\n\n\u201cVery curious\u201d I agreed.",
    "\u201cAnd none of his clothing is marked.",
    "What do we learn from that This man was trying to pass himself off as other than he was.",
    "He was masquerading.",
    "Why Did he fear something Was he trying to escape by disguising himself As yet we do not know but one thing we do know\u2014he was as anxious to conceal his identity as we are to discover it.\u201d\n\nHe looked down at the body again.",
    "\u201cAs before there are no fingerprints on the handle of the dagger.",
    "The murderer again wore gloves.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou think then that the murderer was the same in both cases\u201d I asked eagerly.",
    "Giraud became inscrutable.",
    "\u201cNever mind what I think.",
    "We shall see.",
    "Marchaud\u201d\n\nThe sergent de ville appeared at the doorway.",
    "\u201cMonsieur\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy is Madame Renauld not here I sent for her a quarter of an hour ago\u201d\n\n\u201cShe is coming up the path now monsieur and her son with her.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood.",
    "I only want one at a time though.\u201d\n\nMarchaud saluted and disappeared again.",
    "A moment later he reappeared with Mrs. Renauld.",
    "\u201cHere is Madame.\u201d\n\nGiraud came forward with a curt bow.",
    "\u201cThis way madame.\u201d He led her across and then standing suddenly aside.",
    "\u201cHere is the man.",
    "Do you know him\u201d\n\nAnd as he spoke his eyes gimletlike bored into her face seeking to read her mind noting every indication of her manner.",
    "But Mrs. Renauld remained perfectly calm\u2014too calm I felt.",
    "She looked down at the corpse almost without interest certainly without any sign of agitation or recognition.",
    "\u201cNo\u201d she said.",
    "\u201cI have never seen him in my life.",
    "He is quite a stranger to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are sure\u201d\n\n\u201cQuite sure.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou do not recognize in him one of your assailants for instance\u201d\n\n\u201cNo\u201d she seemed to hesitate as though struck by the idea.",
    "\u201cNo I do not think so.",
    "Of course they wore beards\u2014false ones the examining magistrate thought but still\u2014no.\u201d Now she seemed to make her mind up definitely.",
    "\u201cI am sure neither of the two was this man.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery well madame.",
    "That is all then.\u201d\n\nShe stepped out with head erect the sun flashing on the silver threads in her hair.",
    "Jack Renauld succeeded her.",
    "He too failed to identify the man in a completely natural manner.",
    "Giraud merely grunted.",
    "Whether he was pleased or chagrined I could not tell.",
    "He merely called to Marchaud\n\n\u201cYou have got the other there\u201d\n\n\u201cYes monsieur.\u201d\n\n\u201cBring her in then.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe other\u201d was Madame Daubreuil.",
    "She came indignantly protesting with vehemence.",
    "\u201cI object monsieur This is an outrage What have I to do with all this\u201d\n\n\u201cMadame\u201d said Giraud brutally \u201cI am investigating not one murder but two murders For all I know you may have committed them both.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow dare you\u201d she cried.",
    "\u201cHow dare you insult me by such a wild accusation It is infamous.\u201d\n\n\u201cInfamous is it What about this\u201d Stooping he again detached the hair and held it up.",
    "\u201cDo you see this madame\u201d He advanced towards her.",
    "\u201cYou permit that I see whether it matches\u201d\n\nWith a cry she started backwards white to the lips.",
    "\u201cIt is false\u2014I swear it.",
    "I know nothing of the crime\u2014of either crime.",
    "Any one who says I do lies Ah mon Dieu what shall I do\u201d\n\n\u201cCalm yourself madame\u201d said Giraud coldly.",
    "\u201cNo one has accused you as yet.",
    "But you will do well to answer my questions without more ado.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnything you wish monsieur.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook at the dead man.",
    "Have you ever seen him before\u201d\n\nDrawing nearer a little of the colour creeping back to her face Madame Daubreuil looked down at the victim with a certain amount of interest and curiosity.",
    "Then she shook her head.",
    "\u201cI do not know him.\u201d\n\nIt seemed impossible to doubt her the words came so naturally.",
    "Giraud dismissed her with a nod of the head.",
    "\u201cYou are letting her go\u201d I asked in a low voice.",
    "\u201cIs that wise Surely that black hair is from her head.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do not need teaching my business\u201d said Giraud dryly.",
    "\u201cShe is under surveillance.",
    "I have no wish to arrest her as yet.\u201d\n\nThen frowning he gazed down at the body.",
    "\u201cShould you say that was a Spanish type at all\u201d he asked suddenly.",
    "I considered the face carefully.",
    "\u201cNo\u201d I said at last.",
    "\u201cI should put him down as a Frenchman most decidedly.\u201d\n\nGiraud gave a grunt of dissatisfaction.",
    "\u201cSame here.\u201d\n\nHe stood there for a moment then with an imperative gesture he waved me aside and once more on hands and knees he continued his search of the floor of the shed.",
    "He was marvellous.",
    "Nothing escaped him.",
    "Inch by inch he went over the floor turning over pots examining old sacks.",
    "He pounced on a bundle by the door but it proved to be only a ragged coat and trousers and he flung it down again with a snarl.",
    "Two pairs of old gloves interested him but in the end he shook his head and laid them aside.",
    "Then he went back to the pots methodically turning them over one by one.",
    "In the end he rose to his feet and shook his head thoughtfully.",
    "He seemed baffled and perplexed.",
    "I think he had forgotten my presence.",
    "But at that moment a stir and bustle was heard outside and our old friend the examining magistrate accompanied by his clerk and M. Bex with the doctor behind him came bustling in.",
    "\u201cBut this is extraordinary Mr. Giraud\u201d cried M. Hautet.",
    "\u201cAnother crime Ah we have not got to the bottom of this case.",
    "There is some deep mystery here.",
    "But who is the victim this time\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is just what nobody can tell us M. le juge.",
    "He has not been identified.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere is the body\u201d asked the doctor.",
    "Giraud moved aside a little.",
    "\u201cThere in the corner.",
    "He has been stabbed to the heart as you see.",
    "And with the dagger that was stolen yesterday morning.",
    "I fancy that the murder followed hard upon the theft\u2014but that is for you to say.",
    "You can handle the dagger freely\u2014there are no fingerprints on it.\u201d\n\nThe doctor knelt down by the dead man and Giraud turned to the examining magistrate.",
    "\u201cA pretty little problem is it not But I shall solve it.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd so no one can identify him\u201d mused the magistrate.",
    "\u201cCould it possibly be one of the assassins They may have fallen out among themselves.\u201d\n\nGiraud shook his head.",
    "\u201cThe man is a Frenchman\u2014I would take my oath of that\u2014\u201d\n\nBut at that moment they were interrupted by the doctor who was sitting back on his heels with a perplexed expression.",
    "\u201cYou say he was killed yesterday morning\u201d\n\n\u201cI fix it by the theft of the dagger\u201d explained Giraud.",
    "\u201cHe may of course have been killed later in the day.\u201d\n\n\u201cLater in the day Fiddlesticks This man has been dead at least fortyeight hours and probably longer.\u201d\n\nWe stared at each other in blank amazement.",
    "15\n\nA Photograph\n\n\nThe doctor\u2019s words were so surprising that we were all momentarily taken aback.",
    "Here was a man stabbed with a dagger which we knew to have been stolen only twentyfour hours previously and yet Dr. Durand asserted positively that he had been dead at least fortyeight hours The whole thing was fantastic to the last extreme.",
    "We were still recovering from the surprise of the doctor\u2019s announcement when a telegram was brought to me.",
    "It had been sent up from the hotel to the Villa.",
    "I tore it open.",
    "It was from Poirot and announced his return by the train arriving at Merlinville at 1228.",
    "I looked at my watch and saw that I had just time to get comfortably to the station and meet him there.",
    "I felt that it was of the utmost importance that he should know at once of the new and startling developments in the case.",
    "Evidently I reflected Poirot had had no difficulty in finding what he wanted in Paris.",
    "The quickness of his return proved that.",
    "Very few hours had sufficed.",
    "I wondered how he would take the exciting news I had to impart.",
    "The train was some minutes late and I strolled aimlessly up and down the platform until it occurred to me that I might pass the time by asking a few questions as to who had left Merlinville by the last train on the evening of the tragedy.",
    "I approached the chief porter an intelligent looking man and had little difficulty in persuading him to enter upon the subject.",
    "It was a disgrace to the Police he hotly affirmed that such brigands of assassins should be allowed to go about unpunished.",
    "I hinted that there was some possibility they might have left by the midnight train but he negatived the idea decidedly.",
    "He would have noticed two foreigners\u2014he was sure of it.",
    "Only about twenty people had left by the train and he could not have failed to observe them.",
    "I do not know what put the idea into my head\u2014possibly it was the deep anxiety underlying Marthe Daubreuil\u2019s tones\u2014but I asked suddenly\n\n\u201cYoung M. Renauld\u2014he did not leave by that train did he\u201d\n\n\u201cAh no monsieur.",
    "To arrive and start off again within half an hour it would not be amusing that\u201d\n\nI stared at the man the significance of his words almost escaping me.",
    "Then I saw.",
    "\u2026\n\n\u201cYou mean\u201d I said my heart beating a little \u201cthat M. Jack Renauld arrived at Merlinville that evening\u201d\n\n\u201cBut yes monsieur.",
    "By the last train arriving the other way the 1140.\u201d\n\nMy brain whirled.",
    "That then was the reason of Marthe\u2019s poignant anxiety.",
    "Jack Renauld had been in Merlinville on the night of the crime But why had he not said so Why on the contrary had he led us to believe that he had remained in Cherbourg Remembering his frank boyish countenance I could hardly bring myself to believe that he had any connection with the crime.",
    "Yet why this silence on his part about so vital a matter One thing was certain Marthe had known all along.",
    "Hence her anxiety and her eager questioning of Poirot to know whether any one were suspected.",
    "My cogitations were interrupted by the arrival of the train and in another moment I was greeting Poirot.",
    "The little man was radiant.",
    "He beamed and vociferated and forgetting my English reluctance embraced me warmly on the platform.",
    "\u201cMon cher ami I have succeeded\u2014but succeeded to a marvel\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed I\u2019m delighted to hear it.",
    "Have you heard the latest here\u201d\n\n\u201cHow would you that I should hear anything There have been some developments eh The brave Giraud he has made an arrest Or even arrests perhaps Ah but I will make him look foolish that one But where are you taking me my friend Do we not go to the hotel It is necessary that I attend to my moustaches\u2014they are deplorably limp from the heat of travelling.",
    "Also without doubt there is dust on my coat.",
    "And my tie that I must rearrange.\u201d\n\nI cut short his remonstrances.",
    "\u201cMy dear Poirot\u2014never mind all that.",
    "We must go to the Villa at once.",
    "There has been another murder\u201d\n\nI have frequently been disappointed when fancying that I was giving news of importance to my friend.",
    "Either he has known it already or he has dismissed it as irrelevant to the main issue\u2014and in the latter case events have usually proved him justified.",
    "But this time I could not complain of missing my effect.",
    "Never have I seen a man so flabbergasted.",
    "His jaw dropped.",
    "All the jauntiness went out of his bearing.",
    "He stared at me openmouthed.",
    "\u201cWhat is that you say Another murder Ah then I am all wrong.",
    "I have failed.",
    "Giraud may mock himself at me\u2014he will have reason\u201d\n\n\u201cYou did not expect it then\u201d\n\n\u201cI Not the least in the world.",
    "It demolishes my theory\u2014it ruins everything\u2014it\u2014ah no\u201d He stopped dead thumping himself on the chest.",
    "\u201cIt is impossible.",
    "I cannot be wrong The facts taken methodically and in their proper order admit of only one explanation.",
    "I must be right I am right\u201d\n\n\u201cBut then\u2014\u201d\n\nHe interrupted me.",
    "\u201cWait my friend.",
    "I must be right therefore this new murder is impossible unless\u2014unless\u2014oh wait I implore you.",
    "Say no word\u2014\u201d\n\nHe was silent for a moment or two then resuming his normal manner he said in a quiet assured voice \u201cThe victim is a man of middleage.",
    "His body was found in the locked shed near the scene of the crime and had been dead at least fortyeight hours.",
    "And it is most probable that he was stabbed in a similar manner to M. Renauld though not necessarily in the back.\u201d\n\nIt was my turn to gape\u2014and gape I did.",
    "In all my knowledge of Poirot he had never done anything so amazing as this.",
    "And almost inevitably a doubt crossed my mind.",
    "\u201cPoirot\u201d I cried \u201cyou\u2019re pulling my leg.",
    "You\u2019ve heard all about it already.\u201d\n\nHe turned his earnest gaze upon me reproachfully.",
    "\u201cWould I do such a thing I assure you that I have heard nothing whatsoever.",
    "Did you not observe the shock your news was to me\u201d\n\n\u201cBut how on earth could you know all that\u201d\n\n\u201cI was right then But I knew it.",
    "The little grey cells my friend the little grey cells They told me.",
    "Thus and in no other way could there have been a second death.",
    "Now tell me all.",
    "If we go round to the left here we can take a short cut across the golf links which will bring us to the back of the Villa Genevi\u00e8ve much more quickly.\u201d\n\nAs we walked taking the way he had indicated I recounted all I knew.",
    "Poirot listened attentively.",
    "\u201cThe dagger was in the wound you say That is curious.",
    "You are sure it was the same one\u201d\n\n\u201cAbsolutely certain.",
    "That\u2019s what make it so impossible.\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing is impossible.",
    "There may have been two daggers.\u201d\n\nI raised my eyebrows.",
    "\u201cSurely that is in the highest degree unlikely It would be a most extraordinary coincidence.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou speak as usual without reflection Hastings.",
    "In some cases two identical weapons would be highly improbable.",
    "But not here.",
    "This particular weapon was a war souvenir which was made to Jack Renauld\u2019s orders.",
    "It is really highly unlikely when you come to think of it that he should have had only one made.",
    "Very probably he would have another for his own use.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut nobody has mentioned such a thing\u201d I objected.",
    "A hint of the lecturer crept into Poirot\u2019s tone.",
    "\u201cMy friend in working upon a case one does not take into account only the things that are \u2018mentioned.\u2019 There is no reason to mention many things which may be important.",
    "Equally there is often an excellent reason for not mentioning them.",
    "You can take your choice of the two motives.\u201d\n\nI was silent impressed in spite of myself.",
    "Another few minutes brought us to the famous shed.",
    "We found all our friends there and after an interchange of polite amenities Poirot began his task.",
    "Having watched Giraud at work I was keenly interested.",
    "Poirot bestowed but a cursory glance on the surroundings.",
    "The only thing he examined was the ragged coat and trousers by the door.",
    "A disdainful smile rose to Giraud\u2019s lips and as though noting it Poirot flung the bundle down again.",
    "\u201cOld clothes of the gardener\u2019s\u201d he queried.",
    "\u201cExactly\u201d said Giraud.",
    "Poirot knelt down by the body.",
    "His fingers were rapid but methodical.",
    "He examined the texture of the clothes and satisfied himself that there were no marks on them.",
    "The boots he subjected to special care also the dirty and broken fingernails.",
    "Whilst examining the latter he threw a quick question at Giraud.",
    "\u201cYou saw these\u201d\n\n\u201cYes I saw them\u201d replied the other.",
    "His face remained inscrutable.",
    "Suddenly Poirot stiffened.",
    "\u201cDr.",
    "Durand\u201d\n\n\u201cYes\u201d The doctor came forward.",
    "\u201cThere is foam on the lips.",
    "You observed it\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t notice it I must admit.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you observe it now\u201d\n\n\u201cOh certainly.\u201d\n\nPoirot again shot a question at Giraud.",
    "\u201cYou noticed it without doubt\u201d\n\nThe other did not reply.",
    "Poirot proceeded.",
    "The dagger had been withdrawn from the wound.",
    "It reposed in a glass jar by the side of the body.",
    "Poirot examined it then he studied the wound closely.",
    "When he looked up his eyes were excited and shone with the green light I knew so well.",
    "\u201cIt is a strange wound this It has not bled.",
    "There is no stain on the clothes.",
    "The blade of the dagger is slightly discoloured that is all.",
    "What do you think M. le docteur\u201d\n\n\u201cI can only say that it is most abnormal.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is not abnormal at all.",
    "It is most simple.",
    "The man was stabbed after he was dead.\u201d And stilling the clamour of voices that arose with a wave of his hand Poirot turned to Giraud and added \u201cM.",
    "Giraud agrees with me do you not monsieur\u201d\n\nWhatever Giraud\u2019s real belief he accepted the position without moving a muscle.",
    "Calmly and almost scornfully he replied\n\n\u201cCertainly I agree.\u201d\n\nThe murmur of surprise and interest broke out again.",
    "\u201cBut what an idea\u201d cried M. Hautet.",
    "\u201cTo stab a man after he is dead Barbaric Unheard of Some unappeasable hate perhaps.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo M. le juge\u201d said Poirot.",
    "\u201cI should fancy it was done quite coldbloodedly\u2014to create an impression.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat impression\u201d\n\n\u201cThe impression it nearly did create\u201d returned Poirot oracularly.",
    "M. Bex had been thinking.",
    "\u201cHow then was the man killed\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was not killed.",
    "He died.",
    "He died M. le juge if I am not much mistaken of an epileptic fit\u201d\n\nThis statement of Poirot\u2019s again aroused considerable excitement.",
    "Dr. Durand knelt down again and made a searching examination.",
    "At last he rose to his feet.",
    "\u201cWell M. le docteur\u201d\n\n\u201cM.",
    "Poirot I am inclined to believe that you are correct in your assertion.",
    "I was misled to begin with.",
    "The incontrovertible fact that the man had been stabbed distracted my attention from any other indications.\u201d\n\nPoirot was the hero of the hour.",
    "The examining magistrate was profuse in compliments.",
    "Poirot responded gracefully and then excused himself on the pretext that neither he nor I had yet lunched and that he wished to repair the ravages of the journey.",
    "As we were about to leave the shed Giraud approached us.",
    "\u201cOne more thing M. Poirot\u201d he said in his suave mocking voice.",
    "\u201cWe found this coiled round the handle of the dagger.",
    "A woman\u2019s hair.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh\u201d said Poirot.",
    "\u201cA woman\u2019s hair What woman\u2019s I wonder\u201d\n\n\u201cI wonder also\u201d said Giraud.",
    "Then with a bow he left us.",
    "\u201cHe was insistent the good Giraud\u201d said Poirot thoughtfully as we walked towards the hotel.",
    "\u201cI wonder in what direction he hopes to mislead me A woman\u2019s hair\u2014h\u2019m\u201d\n\nWe lunched heartily but I found Poirot somewhat distrait and inattentive.",
    "Afterwards we went up to our sittingroom and there I begged him to tell me something of his mysterious journey to Paris.",
    "\u201cWillingly my friend.",
    "I went to Paris to find this.\u201d\n\nHe took from his pocket a small faded newspaper cutting.",
    "It was the reproduction of a woman\u2019s photograph.",
    "He handed it to me.",
    "I uttered an exclamation.",
    "\u201cYou recognize it my friend\u201d\n\nI nodded.",
    "Although the photo obviously dated from very many years back and the hair was dressed in a different style the likeness was unmistakable.",
    "\u201cMadame Daubreuil\u201d I exclaimed.",
    "Poirot shook his head with a smile.",
    "\u201cNot quite correct my friend.",
    "She did not call herself by that name in those days.",
    "That is a picture of the notorious Madame Beroldy\u201d\n\nMadame Beroldy In a flash the whole thing came back to me.",
    "The murder trial that had evoked such worldwide interest.",
    "The Beroldy Case.",
    "16\n\nThe Beroldy Case\n\n\nSome twenty years or so before the opening of the present story Monsieur Arnold Beroldy a native of Lyons arrived in Paris accompanied by his pretty wife and their little daughter a mere babe.",
    "Monsieur Beroldy was a junior partner in a firm of wine merchants a stout middleaged man fond of the good things of life devoted to his charming wife and altogether unremarkable in every way.",
    "The firm in which Monsieur Beroldy was a partner was a small one and although doing well it did not yield a large income to the junior partner.",
    "The Beroldys had a small apartment and lived in a very modest fashion to begin with.",
    "But unremarkable though Monsieur Beroldy might be his wife was plentifully gilded with the brush of Romance.",
    "Young and good looking and gifted withal with a singular charm of manner Madame Beroldy at once created a stir in the quarter especially when it began to be whispered that some interesting mystery surrounded her birth.",
    "It was rumoured that she was the illegitimate daughter of a Russian Grand Duke.",
    "Others asserted that it was an Austrian Archduke and that the union was legal though morganatic.",
    "But all stories agreed upon one point that Jeanne Beroldy was the centre of an interesting mystery.",
    "Questioned by the curious Madame Beroldy did not deny these rumours.",
    "On the other hand she let it be clearly understood that though her \u201clips\u201d were \u201csealed\u201d all these stories had a foundation in fact.",
    "To intimate friends she unburdened herself further spoke of political intrigues of \u201cpapers\u201d of obscure dangers that threatened her.",
    "There was also much talk of Crown jewels that were to be sold secretly with herself acting as the gobetween.",
    "Amongst the friends and acquaintances of the Beroldys was a young lawyer Georges Conneau.",
    "It was soon evident that the fascinating Jeanne had completely enslaved his heart.",
    "Madame Beroldy encouraged the young man in a discreet fashion but being always careful to affirm her complete devotion to her middleaged husband.",
    "Nevertheless many spiteful persons did not hesitate to declare that young Conneau was her lover\u2014and not the only one\n\nWhen the Beroldys had been in Paris about three months another personage came upon the scene.",
    "This was Mr. Hiram P. Trapp a native of the United States and extremely wealthy.",
    "Introduced to the charming and mysterious Madame Beroldy he fell a prompt victim to her fascinations.",
    "His admiration was obvious though strictly respectful.",
    "About this time Madame Beroldy became more outspoken in her confidences.",
    "To several friends she declared herself greatly worried on her husband\u2019s behalf.",
    "She explained that he had been drawn into several schemes of a political nature and also referred to some important papers that had been entrusted to him for safekeeping and which concerned a \u201csecret\u201d of far reaching European importance.",
    "They had been entrusted to his custody to throw pursuers off the track but Madame Beroldy was nervous having recognized several important members of the Revolutionary Circle in Paris.",
    "On the 28th day of November the blow fell.",
    "The woman who came daily to clean and cook for the Beroldys was surprised to find the door of the apartment standing wide open.",
    "Hearing faint moans issuing from the bedroom she went in.",
    "A terrible sight met her eyes.",
    "Madame Beroldy lay on the floor bound hand and foot uttering feeble moans having managed to free her mouth from a gag.",
    "On the bed was Monsieur Beroldy lying in a pool of blood with a knife driven through his heart.",
    "Madame Beroldy\u2019s story was clear enough.",
    "Suddenly awakened from sleep she had discerned two masked men bending over her.",
    "Stifling her cries they had bound and gagged her.",
    "They had then demanded of Monsieur Beroldy the famous \u201csecret.\u201d\n\nBut the intrepid wine merchant refused pointblank to accede to their request.",
    "Angered by his refusal one of the men incontinently stabbed him through the heart.",
    "With the dead man\u2019s keys they had opened the safe in the corner and had carried away with them a mass of papers.",
    "Both men were heavily bearded and had worn masks but Madame Beroldy declared positively that they were Russians.",
    "The affair created an immense sensation.",
    "It was referred to variously as \u201cthe Nihilist Atrocity\u201d \u201cRevolutionaries in Paris\u201d and the \u201cRussian Mystery.\u201d Time went on and the mysterious bearded men were never traced.",
    "And then just as public interest was beginning to die down a startling development occurred.",
    "Madame Beroldy was arrested and charged with the murder of her husband.",
    "The trial when it came on aroused widespread interest.",
    "The youth and beauty of the accused and her mysterious history were sufficient to make of it a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre.",
    "People ranged themselves wildly for or against the prisoner.",
    "But her partisans received several severe checks to their enthusiasm.",
    "The romantic past of Madame Beroldy her royal blood and the mysterious intrigues in which she had her being were shown to be mere fantasies of the imagination.",
    "It was proved beyond doubt that Jeanne Beroldy\u2019s parents were a highly respectable and prosaic couple fruit merchants who lived on the outskirts of Lyons.",
    "The Russian Grand Duke the court intrigues and the political schemes\u2014all the stories current were traced back to\u2014the lady herself From her brain had emanated these ingenious myths and she was proved to have raised a considerable sum of money from various credulous persons by her fiction of the \u201cCrown jewels\u201d\u2014the jewels in question being found to be mere paste imitations.",
    "Remorselessly the whole story of her life was laid bare.",
    "The motive for the murder was found in Mr. Hiram P. Trapp.",
    "Mr. Trapp did his best but relentlessly and agilely crossquestioned he was forced to admit that he loved the lady and that had she been free he would have asked her to be his wife.",
    "The fact that the relations between them were admittedly platonic strengthened the case against the accused.",
    "Debarred from becoming his mistress by the simple honourable nature of the man Jeanne Beroldy had conceived the monstrous project of ridding herself of her elderly undistinguished husband and becoming the wife of the rich American.",
    "Throughout Madame Beroldy confronted her accusers with complete sang froid and self possession.",
    "Her story never varied.",
    "She continued to declare strenuously that she was of royal birth and that she had been substituted for the daughter of the fruit seller at an early age.",
    "Absurd and completely unsubstantiated as these statements were a great number of people believed implicitly in their truth.",
    "But the prosecution was implacable.",
    "It denounced the masked \u201cRussians\u201d as a myth and asserted that the crime had been committed by Madame Beroldy and her lover Georges Conneau.",
    "A warrant was issued for the arrest of the latter but he had wisely disappeared.",
    "Evidence showed that the bonds which secured Madame Beroldy were so loose that she could easily have freed herself.",
    "And then towards the close of the trial a letter posted in Paris was sent to the Public Prosecutor.",
    "It was from Georges Conneau and without revealing his whereabouts it contained a full confession of the crime.",
    "He declared that he had indeed struck the fatal blow at Madame Beroldy\u2019s instigation.",
    "The crime had been planned between them.",
    "Believing that her husband illtreated her and maddened by his own passion for her a passion which he believed her to return he had planned the crime and struck the fatal blow that should free the woman he loved from a hateful bondage.",
    "Now for the first time he learnt of Mr. Hiram P. Trapp and realized that the woman he loved had betrayed him Not for his sake did she wish to be free\u2014but in order to marry the wealthy American.",
    "She had used him as a cat\u2019spaw and now in his jealous rage he turned and denounced her declaring that throughout he had acted at her instigation.",
    "And then Madame Beroldy proved herself the remarkable woman she undoubtedly was.",
    "Without hesitation she dropped her previous defence and admitted that the \u201cRussians\u201d were a pure invention on her part.",
    "The real murderer was Georges Conneau.",
    "Maddened by passion he had committed the crime vowing that if she did not keep silence he would enact a terrible vengeance from her.",
    "Terrified by his threats she had consented\u2014also fearing it likely that if she told the truth she might be accused of conniving at the crime.",
    "But she had steadfastly refused to have anything more to do with her husband\u2019s murderer and it was in revenge for this attitude on her part that he had written this letter accusing her.",
    "She swore solemnly that she had had nothing to do with the planning of the crime that she had awoke on that memorable night to find Georges Conneau standing over her the bloodstained knife in his hand.",
    "It was a touch and go affair.",
    "Madame Beroldy\u2019s story was hardly credible.",
    "But this woman whose fairy tales of royal intrigues had been so easily accepted had the supreme art of making herself believed.",
    "Her address to the jury was a masterpiece.",
    "The tears streaming down her face she spoke of her child of her woman\u2019s honour\u2014of her desire to keep her reputation untarnished for the child\u2019s sake.",
    "She admitted that Georges Conneau having been her lover she might perhaps be held morally responsible for the crime\u2014but before God nothing more She knew that she had committed a grave fault in not denouncing Conneau to the law but she declared in a broken voice that that was a thing no woman could have done.",
    "\u2026 She had loved him Could she let her hand be the one to send him to the Guillotine She had been guilty of much but she was innocent of the terrible crime imputed to her.",
    "However that may have been her eloquence and personality won the day.",
    "Madame Beroldy amidst a scene of unparalleled excitement was acquitted.",
    "Despite the utmost endeavours of the police Georges Conneau was never traced.",
    "As for Madame Beroldy nothing more was heard of her.",
    "Taking the child with her she left Paris to begin a new life.",
    "17\n\nWe Make Further Investigations\n\n\nI have set down the Beroldy case in full.",
    "Of course all the details did not present themselves to my memory as I have recounted them here.",
    "Nevertheless I recalled the case fairly accurately.",
    "It had attracted a great deal of interest at the time and had been fully reported by the English papers so that it did not need much effort of memory on my part to recollect the salient details.",
    "Just for the moment in my excitement it seemed to clear up the whole matter.",
    "I admit that I am impulsive and Poirot deplores my custom of jumping to conclusions but I think I had some excuse in this instance.",
    "The remarkable way in which this discovery justified Poirot\u2019s point of view struck me at once.",
    "\u201cPoirot\u201d I said \u201cI congratulate you.",
    "I see everything now.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf that is indeed the truth I congratulate you mon ami.",
    "For as a rule you are not famous for seeing\u2014eh is it not so\u201d\n\nI felt a little annoyed.",
    "\u201cCome now don\u2019t rub it in.",
    "You\u2019ve been so confoundedly mysterious all along with your hints and your insignificant details that any one might fail to see what you were driving at.\u201d\n\nPoirot lit one of his little cigarettes with his usual precision.",
    "Then he looked up.",
    "\u201cAnd since you see everything now mon ami what exactly is it that you see\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy that it was Madame Daubreuil\u2014Beroldy who murdered Mr. Renauld.",
    "The similarity of the two cases proves that beyond a doubt.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen you consider that Madame Beroldy was wrongly acquitted That in actual fact she was guilty of connivance in her husband\u2019s murder\u201d\n\nI opened my eyes wide.",
    "\u201cBut of course Don\u2019t you\u201d\n\nPoirot walked to the end of the room absentmindedly straightened a chair and then said thoughtfully.",
    "\u201cYes that is my opinion.",
    "But there is no \u2018of course\u2019 about it my friend.",
    "Technically speaking Madame Beroldy is innocent.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf that crime perhaps.",
    "But not of this.\u201d\n\nPoirot sat down again and regarded me his thoughtful air more marked than ever.",
    "\u201cSo it is definitely your opinion Hastings that Madame Daubreuil murdered M. Renauld\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy\u201d\n\nHe shot the question at me with such suddenness that I was taken aback.",
    "\u201cWhy\u201d I stammered.",
    "\u201cWhy Oh because\u2014\u201d I came to a stop.",
    "Poirot nodded his head at me.",
    "\u201cYou see you come to a stumblingblock at once.",
    "Why should Madame Daubreuil I shall call her that for clearness sake murder M. Renauld We can find no shadow of a motive.",
    "She does not benefit by his death considered as either mistress or blackmailer she stands to lose.",
    "You cannot have a murder without a motive.",
    "The first crime was different there we had a rich lover waiting to step into her husband\u2019s shoes.\u201d\n\n\u201cMoney is not the only motive for murder\u201d I objected.",
    "\u201cTrue\u201d agreed Poirot placidly.",
    "\u201cThere are two others the crime passionnel is one.",
    "And there is the third rare motive murder for an idea which implies some form of mental derangement on the part of the murderer.",
    "Homicidal mania and religious fanaticism belong to that class.",
    "We can rule it out here.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut what about the crime passionnel Can you rule that out If Madame Daubreuil was Renauld\u2019s mistress if she found that his affection was cooling or if her jealousy was aroused in any way might she not have struck him down in a moment of anger\u201d\n\nPoirot shook his head.",
    "\u201cIf\u2014I say if you note\u2014Madame Daubreuil was Renauld\u2019s mistress he had not had time to tire of her.",
    "And in any case you mistake her character.",
    "She is a woman who can simulate great emotional stress.",
    "She is a magnificent actress.",
    "But looked at dispassionately her life disproves her appearance.",
    "Throughout if we examine it she had been coldblooded and calculating in her motives and actions.",
    "It was not to link her life with that of her young lover that she connived at her husband\u2019s murder.",
    "The rich American for whom she probably did not care a button was her objective.",
    "If she committed a crime she would always do so for gain.",
    "Here there was no gain.",
    "Besides how do you account for the digging of the grave That was a man\u2019s work.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe might have had an accomplice\u201d I suggested unwilling to relinquish my belief.",
    "\u201cI pass to another objection.",
    "You have spoken of the similarity between the two crimes.",
    "Wherein does that lie my friend\u201d\n\nI stared at him in astonishment.",
    "\u201cWhy Poirot it was you who remarked on that The story of the masked men the \u2018secret\u2019 the papers\u201d\n\nPoirot smiled a little.",
    "\u201cDo not be so indignant I beg of you.",
    "I repudiate nothing.",
    "The similarity of the two stories links the two cases together inevitably.",
    "But reflect now on something very curious.",
    "It is not Madame Daubreuil who tells us this tale\u2014if it were all would indeed be plain sailing\u2014it is Madame Renauld.",
    "Is she then in league with the other\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe that\u201d I said slowly.",
    "\u201cIf it is so she must be the most consummate actress the world has ever known.\u201d\n\n\u201cTatata\u201d said Poirot impatiently.",
    "\u201cAgain you have the sentiment and not the logic If it is necessary for a criminal to be a consummate actress then by all means assume her to be one.",
    "But is it necessary I do not believe Madame Renauld to be in league with Madame Daubreuil for several reasons some of which I have already enumerated to you.",
    "The others are selfevident.",
    "Therefore that possibility eliminated we draw very near to the truth which is as always very curious and interesting.\u201d\n\n\u201cPoirot\u201d I cried \u201cwhat more do you know\u201d\n\n\u201cMon ami you must make your own deductions.",
    "You have \u2018access to the facts\u2019 Concentrate your grey cells.",
    "Reason\u2014not like Giraud\u2014but like Hercule Poirot.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut are you sure\u201d\n\n\u201cMy friend in many ways I have been an imbecile.",
    "But at last I see clearly.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know everything\u201d\n\n\u201cI have discovered what M. Renauld sent for me to discover.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you know the murderer\u201d\n\n\u201cI know one murderer.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean\u201d\n\n\u201cWe talk a little at crosspurposes.",
    "There are here not one crime but two.",
    "The first I have solved the second\u2014eh bien I will confess I am not sure\u201d\n\n\u201cBut Poirot I thought you said the man in the shed had died a natural death\u201d\n\n\u201cTatata.\u201d Poirot made his favourite ejaculation of impatience.",
    "\u201cStill you do not understand.",
    "One may have a crime without a murderer but for two crimes it is essential to have two bodies.\u201d\n\nHis remark struck me as so peculiarly lacking in lucidity that I looked at him in some anxiety.",
    "But he appeared perfectly normal.",
    "Suddenly he rose and strolled to the window.",
    "\u201cHere he is\u201d he observed.",
    "\u201cWho\u201d\n\n\u201cM.",
    "Jack Renauld.",
    "I sent a note up to the Villa to ask him to come here.\u201d\n\nThat changed the course of my ideas and I asked Poirot if he knew that Jack Renauld had been in Merlinville on the night of the crime.",
    "I had hoped to catch my astute little friend napping but as usual he was omniscient.",
    "He too had inquired at the station.",
    "\u201cAnd without doubt we are not original in the idea Hastings.",
    "The excellent Giraud he also has probably made his inquiries.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t think\u2014\u201d I said and then stopped.",
    "\u201cAh no it would be too horrible\u201d\n\nPoirot looked inquiringly at me but I said no more.",
    "It had just occurred to me that though there were seven women directly or indirectly connected with the case Mrs. Renauld Madame Daubreuil and her daughter the mysterious visitor and the three servants\u2014there was with the exception of old Auguste who could hardly count only one man\u2014Jack Renauld.",
    "And a man must have dug a grave.",
    "\u2026\n\nI had no time to develop further the appalling idea that had occurred to me for Jack Renauld was ushered into the room.",
    "Poirot greeted him in a businesslike manner.",
    "\u201cTake a seat monsieur.",
    "I regret infinitely to derange you but you will perhaps understand that the atmosphere of the Villa is not too congenial to me.",
    "M. Giraud and I do not see eye to eye about everything.",
    "His politeness to me has not been striking and you will comprehend that I do not intend any little discoveries I may make to benefit him in any way.\u201d\n\n\u201cExactly M. Poirot\u201d said the lad.",
    "\u201cThat fellow Giraud is an illconditioned brute and I\u2019d be delighted to see some one score at his expense.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen I may ask a little favour of you\u201d\n\n\u201cCertainly.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will ask you to go to the railway station and take a train to the next station along the line Abbalac.",
    "Ask there at the cloakroom whether two foreigners deposited a valise there on the night of the murder.",
    "It is a small station and they are almost certain to remember.",
    "Will you do this\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course I will\u201d said the boy mystified though ready for the task.",
    "\u201cI and my friend you comprehend have business elsewhere\u201d explained Poirot.",
    "\u201cThere is a train in a quarter of an hour and I will ask you not to return to the Villa as I have no wish for Giraud to get an inkling of your errand.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery well I will go straight to the station.\u201d\n\nHe rose to his feet.",
    "Poirot\u2019s voice stopped him.",
    "\u201cOne moment M. Renauld there is one little matter that puzzles me.",
    "Why did you not mention to M. Hautet this morning that you were in Merlinville on the night of the crime\u201d\n\nJack Renauld\u2019s face went crimson.",
    "With an effort he controlled himself.",
    "\u201cYou have made a mistake.",
    "I was in Cherbourg as I told the examining magistrate this morning.\u201d\n\nPoirot looked at him his eyes narrowed catlike until they only showed a gleam of green.",
    "\u201cThen it is a singular mistake that I have made there\u2014for it is shared by the station staff.",
    "They say you arrived by the 1140 train.\u201d\n\nFor a moment Jack Renauld hesitated then he made up his mind.",
    "\u201cAnd if I did I suppose you do not mean to accuse me of participating in my father\u2019s murder\u201d He asked the question haughtily his head thrown back.",
    "\u201cI should like an explanation of the reason that brought you here.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is simple enough.",
    "I came to see my fianc\u00e9e Mademoiselle Daubreuil.",
    "I was on the eve of a long voyage uncertain as to when I should return.",
    "I wished to see her before I went to assure her of my unchanging devotion.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you did see her\u201d Poirot\u2019s eyes never left the other\u2019s face.",
    "There was an appreciable pause before Renauld replied.",
    "Then he said\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd afterwards\u201d\n\n\u201cI found I had missed the last train.",
    "I walked to St. Beauvais where I knocked up a garage and got a car to take me back to Cherbourg.\u201d\n\n\u201cSt.",
    "Beauvais That is fifteen kilometres.",
    "A long walk M. Renauld.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2014I felt like walking.\u201d\n\nPoirot bowed his head as a sign that he accepted the explanation.",
    "Jack Renauld took up his hat and cane and departed.",
    "In a trice Poirot jumped to his feet.",
    "\u201cQuick Hastings.",
    "We will go after him.\u201d\n\nKeeping a discreet distance behind our quarry we followed him through the streets of Merlinville.",
    "But when Poirot saw that he took the turning to the station he checked himself.",
    "\u201cAll is well.",
    "He has taken the bait.",
    "He will go to Abbalac and will inquire for the mythical valise left by the mythical foreigners.",
    "Yes mon ami all that was a little invention of my own.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou wanted him out of the way\u201d I exclaimed.",
    "\u201cYour penetration is amazing Hastings Now if you please we will go up to the Villa Genevi\u00e8ve.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n18\n\nGiraud Acts\n\n\n\u201cBy the way Poirot\u201d I said as we walked along the hot white road \u201cI\u2019ve got a bone to pick with you.",
    "I dare say you meant well but really it was no business of yours to go mouching round to the H\u00f4tel du Phare without letting me know.\u201d\n\nPoirot shot a quick sidelong glance at me.",
    "\u201cAnd how did you know I had been there\u201d he inquired.",
    "Much to my annoyance I felt the colour rising in my cheeks.",
    "\u201cI happened to look in in passing\u201d I explained with as much dignity as I could muster.",
    "I rather feared Poirot\u2019s banter but to my relief and somewhat to my surprise he only shook his head with a rather unusual gravity.",
    "\u201cIf I have offended your susceptibilities in any way I demand pardon of you.",
    "You will understand better soon.",
    "But believe me I have striven to concentrate all my energies on the case.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh it\u2019s all right\u201d I said mollified by the apology.",
    "\u201cI know it\u2019s only that you have my interests at heart.",
    "But I can take care of myself all right.\u201d\n\nPoirot seemed to be about to say something further but checked himself.",
    "Arrived at the Villa Poirot led the way up to the shed where the second body had been discovered.",
    "He did not however go in but paused by the bench which I have mentioned before as being set some few yards away from it.",
    "After contemplating it for a moment or two he paced carefully from it to the hedge which marked the boundary between the Villa Genevi\u00e8ve and the Villa Marguerite.",
    "Then he paced back again nodding his head as he did so.",
    "Returning again to the hedge he parted the bushes with his hands.",
    "\u201cWith good fortune\u201d he remarked to me over his shoulder \u201cMademoiselle Marthe may find herself in the garden.",
    "I desire to speak to her and would prefer not to call formally at the Villa Marguerite.",
    "Ah all is well there she is.",
    "Pst mademoiselle Pst Un moment s\u2019il vous pla\u00eet.\u201d\n\nI joined him at the moment that Marthe Daubreuil looking slightly startled came running up to the hedge at his call.",
    "\u201cA little word with you mademoiselle if it is permitted\u201d\n\n\u201cCertainly Monsieur Poirot.\u201d\n\nDespite her acquiescence her eyes looked troubled and afraid.",
    "\u201cMademoiselle do you remember running after me on the road the day that I came to your house with the examining magistrate You asked me if any one were suspected of the crime.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you told me two Chilians.\u201d Her voice sounded rather breathless and her left hand stole to her breast.",
    "\u201cWill you ask me the same question again mademoiselle\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean\u201d\n\n\u201cThis.",
    "If you were to ask me that question again I should give you a different answer.",
    "Some one is suspected\u2014but not a Chilian.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho\u201d The word came faintly between her parted lips.",
    "\u201cM.",
    "Jack Renauld.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u201d It was a cry.",
    "\u201cJack Impossible.",
    "Who dares to suspect him\u201d\n\n\u201cGiraud.\u201d\n\n\u201cGiraud\u201d The girl\u2019s face was ashy.",
    "\u201cI am afraid of that man.",
    "He is cruel.",
    "He will\u2014he will\u2014\u201d She broke off.",
    "There was courage gathering in her face and determination.",
    "I realized in that moment that she was a fighter.",
    "Poirot too watched her intently.",
    "\u201cYou know of course that he was here on the night of the murder\u201d he asked.",
    "\u201cYes\u201d she replied mechanically.",
    "\u201cHe told me.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was unwise to have tried to conceal the fact\u201d ventured Poirot.",
    "\u201cYes yes\u201d she replied impatiently.",
    "\u201cBut we cannot waste time on regrets.",
    "We must find something to save him.",
    "He is innocent of course but that will not help him with a man like Giraud who has his reputation to think of.",
    "He must arrest some one and that some one will be Jack.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe facts will tell against him\u201d said Poirot.",
    "\u201cYou realize that\u201d\n\nShe faced him squarely and used the words I had heard her say in her mother\u2019s drawingroom.",
    "\u201cI am not a child monsieur.",
    "I can be brave and look facts in the face.",
    "He is innocent and we must save him.\u201d\n\nShe spoke with a kind of desperate energy then was silent frowning as she thought.",
    "\u201cMademoiselle\u201d said Poirot observing her keenly \u201cis there not something that you are keeping back that you could tell us\u201d\n\nShe nodded perplexedly.",
    "\u201cYes there is something but I hardly know whether you will believe it\u2014it seems so absurd.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt any rate tell us mademoiselle.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is this.",
    "M. Giraud sent for me as an afterthought to see if I could identify the man in there.\u201d She signed with her head towards the shed.",
    "\u201cI could not.",
    "At least I could not at the moment.",
    "But since I have been thinking\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWell\u201d\n\n\u201cIt seems so queer and yet I am almost sure.",
    "I will tell you.",
    "On the morning of the day M. Renauld was murdered I was walking in the garden here when I heard a sound of men\u2019s voices quarrelling.",
    "I pushed aside the bushes and looked through.",
    "One of the men was M. Renauld and the other was a tramp a dreadful looking creature in filthy rags.",
    "He was alternately whining and threatening.",
    "I gathered he was asking for money but at that moment maman called me from the house and I had to go.",
    "That is all only\u2014I am almost sure that the tramp and the dead man in the shed are one and the same.\u201d\n\nPoirot uttered an exclamation.",
    "\u201cBut why did you not say so at the time mademoiselle\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause at first it only struck me that the face was vaguely familiar in some way.",
    "The man was differently dressed and apparently belonged to a superior station in life.",
    "But tell me Monsieur Poirot is it not possible that this tramp might have attacked and killed M. Renauld and taken his clothes and money\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is an idea mademoiselle\u201d said Poirot slowly.",
    "\u201cIt leaves a lot unexplained but it is certainly an idea.",
    "I will think of it.\u201d\n\nA voice called from the house.",
    "\u201cMaman\u201d whispered Marthe \u201cI must go.\u201d And she slipped away through the trees.",
    "\u201cCome\u201d said Poirot and taking my arm turned in the direction of the Villa.",
    "\u201cWhat do you really think\u201d I asked in some curiosity.",
    "\u201cWas that story true or did the girl make it up in order to divert suspicion from her lover\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is a curious tale\u201d said Poirot \u201cbut I believe it to be the absolute truth.",
    "Unwittingly Mademoiselle Marthe told us the truth on another point\u2014and incidentally gave Jack Renauld the lie.",
    "Did you notice his hesitation when I asked him if he saw Marthe Daubreuil on the night of the crime He paused and then said \u2018Yes.\u2019 I suspected that he was lying.",
    "It was necessary for me to see Mademoiselle Marthe before he could put her on her guard.",
    "Three little words gave me the information I wanted.",
    "When I asked her if she knew that Jack Renauld was here that night she answered \u2018He told me.\u2019 Now Hastings what was Jack Renauld doing here on that eventful evening and if he did not see Mademoiselle Marthe whom did he see\u201d\n\n\u201cSurely Poirot\u201d I cried aghast \u201cyou cannot believe that a boy like that would murder his own father.\u201d\n\n\u201cMon ami\u201d said Poirot \u201cyou continue to be of a sentimentality unbelievable I have seen mothers who murdered their little children for the sake of the insurance money After that one can believe anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the motive\u201d\n\n\u201cMoney of course.",
    "Remember that Jack Renauld thought that he would come in to half his father\u2019s fortune at the latter\u2019s death.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut the tramp.",
    "Where does he come in\u201d\n\nPoirot shrugged his shoulders.",
    "\u201cGiraud would say that he was an accomplice\u2014an apache who helped young Renauld to commit the crime and who was conveniently put out of the way afterwards.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut the hair round the dagger The woman\u2019s hair\u201d\n\n\u201cAh\u201d said Poirot smiling broadly.",
    "\u201cThat is the cream of Giraud\u2019s little jest.",
    "According to him it is not a woman\u2019s hair at all.",
    "Remember that the youths of today wear their hair brushed straight back from the forehead with pomade or hairwash to make it lie flat.",
    "Consequently some of the hairs are of considerable length.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you believe that too\u201d\n\n\u201cNo\u201d said Poirot with a curious smile.",
    "\u201cFor I know it to be the hair of a woman\u2014and more which woman\u201d\n\n\u201cMadame Daubreuil\u201d I announced positively.",
    "\u201cPerhaps\u201d said Poirot regarding me quizzically.",
    "But I refused to allow myself to get annoyed.",
    "\u201cWhat are we going to do now\u201d I asked as we entered the hall of the Villa Genevi\u00e8ve.",
    "\u201cI wish to make a search amongst the effects of M. Jack Renauld.",
    "That is why I had to get him out of the way for a few hours.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut will not Giraud have searched already\u201d I asked doubtfully.",
    "\u201cOf course.",
    "He builds a case as a beaver builds a dam with a fatiguing industry.",
    "But he will not have looked for the things that I am seeking\u2014in all probability he would not have seen their importance if they stared him in the face.",
    "Let us begin.\u201d\n\nNeatly and methodically Poirot opened each drawer in turn examined the contents and returned them exactly to their places.",
    "It was a singularly dull and uninteresting proceeding.",
    "Poirot waded on through collars pajamas and socks.",
    "A purring noise outside drew me to the window.",
    "Instantly I became galvanized into life.",
    "\u201cPoirot\u201d I cried.",
    "\u201cA car has just driven up.",
    "Giraud is in it and Jack Renauld and two gendarmes.\u201d\n\n\u201cSacr\u00e9 tonnerre\u201d growled Poirot.",
    "\u201cThat animal of a Giraud could he not wait I shall not be able to replace the things in this last drawer with the proper method.",
    "Let us be quick.\u201d\n\nUnceremoniously he tumbled out the things on the floor mostly ties and handkerchiefs.",
    "Suddenly with a cry of triumph Poirot pounced on something a small square cardboard evidently a photograph.",
    "Thrusting it into his pocket he returned the things pellmell to the drawer and seizing me by the arm dragged me out of the room and down the stairs.",
    "In the hall stood Giraud contemplating his prisoner.",
    "\u201cGood afternoon M. Giraud\u201d said Poirot.",
    "\u201cWhat have we here\u201d\n\nGiraud nodded his head towards Jack.",
    "\u201cHe was trying to make a getaway but I was too sharp for him.",
    "He is under arrest for the murder of his father M. Paul Renauld.\u201d\n\nPoirot wheeled to confront the boy who leaned limply against the door his face ashy pale.",
    "\u201cWhat do you say to that jeune homme\u201d\n\nJack Renauld stared at him stonily.",
    "\u201cNothing\u201d he said.",
    "19\n\nI Use My Grey Cells\n\n\nI was dumbfounded.",
    "Up to the last I had not been able bring myself to believe Jack Renauld guilty.",
    "I had expected a ringing proclamation of his innocence when Poirot challenged him.",
    "But now watching him as he stood white and limp against the wall and hearing the damning admission fall from his lips I doubted no longer.",
    "But Poirot had turned to Giraud.",
    "\u201cWhat are your grounds for arresting him\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you expect me to give them to you\u201d\n\n\u201cAs a matter of courtesy yes.\u201d\n\nGiraud looked at him doubtfully.",
    "He was torn between a desire to refuse rudely and the pleasure of triumphing over his adversary.",
    "\u201cYou think I have made a mistake I suppose\u201d he sneered.",
    "\u201cIt would not surprise me\u201d replied Poirot with a soup\u00e7on of malice.",
    "Giraud\u2019s face took on a deeper tinge of red.",
    "\u201cEh bien come in here.",
    "You shall judge for yourself.\u201d He flung open the door of the salon and we passed in leaving Jack Renauld in the care of the two other men.",
    "\u201cNow M. Poirot\u201d said Giraud laying his hat on the table and speaking with the utmost sarcasm \u201cI will treat you to a little lecture on detective work.",
    "I will show you how we moderns work.\u201d\n\n\u201cBien\u201d said Poirot composing himself to listen.",
    "\u201cI will show you how admirably the Old Guard can listen\u201d and he leaned back and closed his eyes opening them for a moment to remark.",
    "\u201cDo not fear that I shall sleep.",
    "I will attend most carefully.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course\u201d began Giraud \u201cI soon saw through all that Chilian tomfoolery.",
    "Two men were in it\u2014but they were not mysterious foreigners All that was a blind.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery creditable so far my dear Giraud\u201d murmured Poirot.",
    "\u201cEspecially after that clever trick of theirs with the match and cigarette end.\u201d\n\nGiraud glared but continued\n\n\u201cA man must have been connected with the case in order to dig the grave.",
    "There is no man who actually benefits by the crime but there was a man who thought he would benefit.",
    "I heard of Jack Renauld\u2019s quarrel with his father and of the threats that he had used.",
    "The motive was established.",
    "Now as to means.",
    "Jack Renauld was in Merlinville that night.",
    "He concealed the fact\u2014which turned suspicion into certainty.",
    "Then we found a second victim\u2014stabbed with the same dagger.",
    "We know when that dagger was stolen.",
    "Captain Hastings here can fix the time.",
    "Jack Renauld arriving from Cherbourg was the only person who could have taken it.",
    "I have accounted for all the other members of the household.\u201d\n\nPoirot interrupted\n\n\u201cYou are wrong.",
    "There is one other person who could have taken the dagger.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou refer to M. Stonor He arrived at the front door in an automobile which had brought him straight from Calais.",
    "Ah believe me I have looked into everything.",
    "M. Jack Renauld arrived by train.",
    "An hour elapsed between his arrival and the moment he presented himself at the house.",
    "Without doubt he saw Captain Hastings and his companion leave the shed slipped in himself and took the dagger stabbed his accomplice in the shed\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWho was already dead\u201d\n\nGiraud shrugged his shoulders.",
    "\u201cPossibly he did not observe that.",
    "He may have judged him to be sleeping.",
    "Without doubt they had a rendezvous.",
    "In any case he knew this apparent second murder would greatly complicate the case.",
    "It did.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut it could not deceive M. Giraud\u201d murmured Poirot.",
    "\u201cYou mock yourself at me.",
    "But I will give you one last irrefutable proof.",
    "Madame Renauld\u2019s story was false\u2014a fabrication from beginning to end.",
    "We believe Madame Renauld to have loved her husband\u2014yet she lied to shield his murderer.",
    "For whom will a woman lie Sometimes for herself usually for the man she loves always for her children.",
    "That is the last\u2014the irrefutable proof.",
    "You cannot get round it.\u201d\n\nGiraud paused flushed and triumphant.",
    "Poirot regarded him steadily.",
    "\u201cThat is my case\u201d said Giraud.",
    "\u201cWhat have you to say to it\u201d\n\n\u201cOnly that there is one thing you have failed to take into account.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is that\u201d\n\n\u201cJack Renauld was presumably acquainted with the planning out of the golf course.",
    "He knew that the body would be discovered almost at once when they started to dig the bunker.\u201d\n\nGiraud laughed out loud.",
    "\u201cBut it is idiotic what you say there He wanted the body to be found Until it was found he could not presume death and would have been unable to enter into his inheritance.\u201d\n\nI saw a quick flash of green in Poirot\u2019s eyes as he rose to his feet.",
    "\u201cThen why bury it\u201d he asked softly.",
    "\u201cReflect Giraud.",
    "Since it was to Jack Renauld\u2019s advantage that the body should be found without delay why dig a grave at all\u201d\n\nGiraud did not reply.",
    "The question found him unprepared.",
    "He shrugged his shoulders as though to intimate that it was of no importance.",
    "Poirot moved towards the door.",
    "I followed him.",
    "\u201cThere is one more thing that you have failed to take into account\u201d he said over his shoulder.",
    "\u201cWhat is that\u201d\n\n\u201cThe piece of lead piping\u201d said Poirot and left the room.",
    "Jack Renauld still stood in the hall with a white dumb face but as we came out of the salon he looked up sharply.",
    "At the same moment there was the sound of a footfall on the staircase.",
    "Mrs. Renauld was descending it.",
    "At the sight of her son standing between the two myrmidons of the law she stopped as though petrified.",
    "\u201cJack\u201d she faltered.",
    "\u201cJack what is this\u201d\n\nHe looked up at her his face set.",
    "\u201cThey have arrested me mother.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u201d\n\nShe uttered a piercing cry and before any one could get to her swayed and fell heavily.",
    "We both ran to her and lifted her up.",
    "In a minute Poirot stood up again.",
    "\u201cShe has cut her head badly on the corner of the stairs.",
    "I fancy there is a slight concussion also.",
    "If Giraud wants a statement from her he will have to wait.",
    "She will probably be unconscious for at least a week.\u201d\n\nDenise and Fran\u00e7oise had run to their mistress and leaving her in their charge Poirot left the house.",
    "He walked with his head bent down frowning thoughtfully at the ground.",
    "For some time I did not speak but at last I ventured to put a question to him.",
    "\u201cDo you believe then in spite of all appearances to the contrary that Jack Renauld may not be guilty\u201d\n\nPoirot did not answer at once but after a long wait he said gravely\n\n\u201cI do not know Hastings.",
    "There is just a chance of it.",
    "Of course Giraud is all wrong\u2014wrong from beginning to end.",
    "If Jack Renauld is guilty it is in spite of Giraud\u2019s arguments not because of them.",
    "And the gravest indictment against him is known only to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is that\u201d I asked impressed.",
    "\u201cIf you would use your grey cells and see the whole case clearly as I do you too would perceive it my friend.\u201d\n\nThis was what I called one of Poirot\u2019s irritating answers.",
    "He went on without waiting for me to speak.",
    "\u201cLet us walk this way to the sea.",
    "We will sit on that little mound there overlooking the beach and review the case.",
    "You shall know all that I know but I would prefer that you should come at the truth by your own efforts\u2014not by my leading you by the hand.\u201d\n\nWe established ourselves on the grassy knoll as Poirot had suggested looking out to sea.",
    "From farther along the sand the cries of the bathers reached us faintly.",
    "The sea was of the palest blue and the halcyon calm reminded me of the day we had arrived at Merlinville my own good spirits and Poirot\u2019s suggestion that I was \u201cfey.\u201d What a long time seemed to have elapsed since then.",
    "And in reality it was only three days\n\n\u201cThink my friend\u201d said Poirot\u2019s voice encouragingly.",
    "\u201cArrange your ideas.",
    "Be methodical.",
    "Be orderly.",
    "There is the secret of success.\u201d\n\nI endeavoured to obey him casting my mind back over all the details of the case.",
    "And reluctantly it seemed to me that the only clear and possible solution was that of Giraud\u2014which Poirot despised.",
    "I reflected anew.",
    "If there was daylight anywhere it was in the direction of Madame Daubreuil.",
    "Giraud was ignorant of her connection with the Beroldy Case.",
    "Poirot had declared the Beroldy Case to be all important.",
    "It was there I must seek.",
    "I was on the right track now.",
    "And suddenly I started as an idea of bewildering luminosity shot into my brain.",
    "Trembling I built up my hypothesis.",
    "\u201cYou have a little idea I see mon ami Capital.",
    "We progress.\u201d\n\nI sat up and lit a pipe.",
    "\u201cPoirot\u201d I said \u201cit seems to me we have been strangely remiss.",
    "I say we\u2014although I dare say I would be nearer the mark.",
    "But you must pay the penalty of your determined secrecy.",
    "So I say again we have been strangely remiss.",
    "There is some one we have forgotten.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd who is that\u201d inquired Poirot with twinkling eyes.",
    "\u201cGeorges Conneau\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n20\n\nAn Amazing Statement\n\n\nThe next moment Poirot embraced me warmly.",
    "\u201cEnfin You have arrived.",
    "And all by yourself.",
    "It is superb Continue your reasoning.",
    "You are right.",
    "Decidedly we have done wrong to forget Georges Conneau.\u201d\n\nI was so flattered by the little man\u2019s approval that I could hardly continue.",
    "But at last I collected my thoughts and went on.",
    "\u201cGeorges Conneau disappeared twenty years ago but we have no reason to believe that he is dead.\u201d\n\n\u201cAucunement\u201d agreed Poirot.",
    "\u201cProceed.\u201d\n\n\u201cTherefore we will assume that he is alive.\u201d\n\n\u201cExactly.\u201d\n\n\u201cOr that he was alive until recently.\u201d\n\n\u201cDe mieux en mieux\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will presume\u201d I continued my enthusiasm rising \u201cthat he has fallen on evil days.",
    "He has become a criminal an apache a tramp\u2014a what you will.",
    "He chances to come to Merlinville.",
    "There he finds the woman he has never ceased to love.\u201d\n\n\u201cEh eh The sentimentality\u201d warned Poirot.",
    "\u201cWhere one hates one also loves\u201d I quoted or misquoted.",
    "\u201cAt any rate he finds her there living under an assumed name.",
    "But she has a new lover the Englishman Renauld.",
    "Georges Conneau the memory of old wrongs rising in him quarrels with this Renauld.",
    "He lies in wait for him as he comes to visit his mistress and stabs him in the back.",
    "Then terrified at what he has done he starts to dig a grave.",
    "I imagine it likely that Madame Daubreuil comes out to look for her lover.",
    "She and Conneau have a terrible scene.",

    "Primed with the story that Madame Daubreuil has suggested to him she permits herself to be gagged and bound.",
    "There Poirot what do you think of that\u201d I leaned back flushed with the pride of successful reconstruction.",
    "Poirot looked at me thoughtfully.",
    "\u201cI think that you should write for the Kinema mon ami\u201d he remarked at last.",
    "\u201cYou mean\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIt would make a good film the story that you have recounted to me there\u2014but it bears no sort of resemblance to everyday life.\u201d\n\n\u201cI admit that I haven\u2019t gone into all the details but\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have gone further\u2014you have ignored them magnificently.",
    "What about the way the two men were dressed Do you suggest that after stabbing his victim Conneau removed his suit of clothes donned it himself and replaced the dagger\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see that that matters\u201d I objected rather huffily.",
    "\u201cHe may have obtained clothes and money from Madame Daubreuil by threats earlier in the day.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy threats\u2014eh You seriously advance that supposition\u201d\n\n\u201cCertainly.",
    "He could have threatened to reveal her identity to the Renaulds which would probably have put an end to all hopes of her daughter\u2019s marriage.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are wrong Hastings.",
    "He could not blackmail her for she had the whip hand.",
    "Georges Conneau remember is still wanted for murder.",
    "A word from her and he is in danger of the guillotine.\u201d\n\nI was forced rather reluctantly to admit the truth of this.",
    "\u201cYour theory\u201d I remarked acidly \u201cis doubtless correct as to all the details\u201d\n\n\u201cMy theory is the truth\u201d said Poirot quietly.",
    "\u201cAnd the truth is necessarily correct.",
    "In your theory you made a fundamental error.",
    "You permitted your imagination to lead you astray with midnight assignations and passionate love scenes.",
    "But in investigating crime we must take our stand upon the commonplace.",
    "Shall I demonstrate my methods to you\u201d\n\n\u201cOh by all means let us have a demonstration\u201d\n\nPoirot sat very upright and began wagging his forefinger emphatically to emphasize his points.",
    "\u201cI will start as you started from the basic fact of Georges Conneau.",
    "Now the story told by Madame Beroldy in court as to the \u2018Russians\u2019 was admittedly a fabrication.",
    "If she was innocent of connivance in the crime it was concocted by her and by her only as she stated.",
    "If on the other hand she was not innocent it might have been invented by either her or Georges Conneau.",
    "\u201cNow in this case we are investigating we meet the same tale.",
    "As I pointed out to you the facts render it very unlikely that Madame Daubreuil inspired it.",
    "So we turn to the hypothesis that the story had its origin in the brain of Georges Conneau.",
    "Very good.",
    "Georges Conneau therefore planned the crime with Madame Renauld as his accomplice.",
    "She is in the limelight and behind her is a shadowy figure whose alias is unknown to us.",
    "\u201cNow let us go carefully over the Renauld Case from the beginning setting down each significant point in its chronological order.",

    "Now what is the earliest point to note down\u201d\n\n\u201cThe letter to you\u201d\n\n\u201cThat was the first we knew of it but it is not the proper beginning of the case.",
    "The first point of any significance I should say is the change that came over M. Renauld shortly after arriving in Merlinville and which is attested to by several witnesses.",
    "We have also to consider his friendship with Madame Daubreuil and the large sums of money paid over to her.",
    "From thence we can come directly to the 23rd May.\u201d\n\nPoirot paused cleared his throat and signed to me to write.",

    "\u201cThere Hastings take each of those facts one by one consider them carefully by themselves and in relation to the whole and see if you do not get new light on the matter.\u201d\n\nI endeavoured conscientiously to do as he had said.",
    "After a moment or two I said rather doubtfully\n\n\u201cAs to the first points the question seems to be whether we adopt the theory of blackmail or of an infatuation for this woman.\u201d\n\n\u201cBlackmail decidedly.",
    "You heard what Stonor said as to his character and habits.\u201d\n\n\u201cMrs.",
    "Renauld did not confirm his view\u201d I argued.",
    "\u201cWe have already seen that Madame Renauld\u2019s testimony cannot be relied upon in any way.",
    "We must trust to Stonor on that point.\u201d\n\n\u201cStill if Renauld had an affair with a woman called Bella there seems no inherent improbability in his having another with Madame Daubreuil.\u201d\n\n\u201cNone whatever I grant you Hastings.",
    "But did he\u201d\n\n\u201cThe letter Poirot.",
    "You forget the letter.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo I do not forget.",
    "But what makes you think that letter was written to M. Renauld\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy it was found in his pocket and\u2014and\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd that is all\u201d cut in Poirot.",
    "\u201cThere was no mention of any name to show to whom the letter was addressed.",
    "We assumed it was to the dead man because it was in the pocket of his overcoat.",
    "Now mon ami something about that overcoat struck me as unusual.",
    "I measured it and made the remark that he wore his overcoat very long.",
    "That remark should have given you to think.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought you were just saying it for the sake of saying something\u201d I confessed.",
    "\u201cAh quelle id\u00e9e Later you observed me measuring the overcoat of M. Jack Renauld.",
    "Eh bien M. Jack Renauld wears his overcoat very short.",
    "Put those two facts together with a third namely that M. Jack Renauld flung out of the house in a hurry on his departure for Paris and tell me what you make of it\u201d\n\n\u201cI see\u201d I said slowly as the meaning of Poirot\u2019s remarks bore in upon me.",
    "\u201cThat letter was written to Jack Renauld\u2014not to his father.",
    "He caught up the wrong overcoat in his haste and agitation.\u201d\n\nPoirot nodded.",
    "\u201cPr\u00e9cisement We can return to this point later.",
    "For the moment let us content ourselves with accepting the letter as having nothing to do with M. Renauld p\u00e8re and pass to the next chronological event.\u201d\n\n\u201cMay 23rd\u201d I read \u201cM.",
    "Renauld quarrels with his son over latter\u2019s wish to marry Marthe Daubreuil.",
    "Son leaves for Paris.",
    "I don\u2019t see anything much to remark upon there and the altering of the will the following day seems straightforward enough.",
    "It was the direct result of the quarrel.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe agree mon ami\u2014at least as to the cause.",
    "But what exact motive underlay this procedure of M. Renauld\u2019s\u201d\n\nI opened my eyes in surprise.",
    "\u201cAnger against his son of course.\u201d\n\n\u201cYet he wrote him affectionate letters to Paris\u201d\n\n\u201cSo Jack Renauld says but he cannot produce them.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell let us pass from that.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow we come to the day of the tragedy.",
    "You have placed the events of the morning in a certain order.",
    "Have you any justification for that\u201d\n\n\u201cI have ascertained that the letter to me was posted at the same time as the telegram was despatched.",
    "Masters was informed he could take a holiday shortly afterwards.",
    "In my opinion the quarrel with the tramp took place anterior to these happenings.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do not see that you can fix that definitely\u2014unless you question Mademoiselle Dabreuil again.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no need.",
    "I am sure of it.",
    "And if you do not see that you see nothing Hastings\u201d\n\nI looked at him for a moment.",
    "\u201cOf course I am an idiot.",
    "If the tramp was Georges Conneau it was after the stormy interview with him that Mr. Renauld apprehended danger.",
    "He sent away the chauffeur Masters whom he suspected of being in the other\u2019s pay he wired to his son and sent for you.\u201d\n\nA faint smile crossed Poirot\u2019s lips.",
    "\u201cYou do not think it strange that he should use exactly the same expressions in his letter as Madame Renauld used later in her story If the mention of Santiago was a blind why should Renauld speak of it and\u2014what is more\u2014send his son there\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is puzzling I admit but perhaps we shall find some explanation later.",
    "We come now to the evening and the visit of the mysterious lady.",
    "I confess that that fairly baffles me unless it was Madame Daubreuil as Fran\u00e7oise all along maintained.\u201d\n\nPoirot shook his head.",
    "\u201cMy friend my friend where are your wits wandering Remember the fragment of cheque and the fact that the name Bella Duveen was faintly familiar to Stonor and I think we may take it for granted that Bella Duveen is the full name of Jack\u2019s unknown correspondent and that it was she who came to the Villa Genevi\u00e8ve that night.",
    "Whether she intended to see Jack or whether she meant all along to appeal to his father we cannot be certain but I think we may assume that this is what occurred.",
    "She produced her claim upon Jack probably showed letters that he had written her and the older man tried to buy her off by writing a cheque.",
    "This she indignantly tore up.",
    "The terms of her letter are those of a woman genuinely in love and she would probably deeply resent being offered money.",
    "In the end he got rid of her and here the words that he used are significant.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u200a\u2018Yes yes but for God\u2019s sake go now\u2019\u200a\u201d I repeated.",
    "\u201cThey seem to me a little vehement perhaps that is all.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is enough.",
    "He was desperately anxious for the girl to go.",
    "Why Not only because the interview was unpleasant.",
    "No it was the time that was slipping by and for some reason time was precious.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy should it be\u201d I asked bewildered.",
    "\u201cThat is what we ask ourselves.",
    "Why should it be But later we have the incident of the wrist watch\u2014which again shows us that time plays a very important part in the crime.",
    "We are now fast approaching the actual drama.",
    "It is halfpast ten when Bella Duveen leaves and by the evidence of the wrist watch we know that the crime was committed or at any rate that it was staged before twelve o\u2019clock.",
    "We have reviewed all the events anterior to the murder there remains only one unplaced.",
    "By the doctor\u2019s evidence the tramp when found had been dead at least fortyeight hours\u2014with a possible margin of twentyfour hours more.",
    "Now with no other facts to help me than those we have discussed I place the death as having occurred on the morning of June 7th.\u201d\n\nI stared at him stupefied.",
    "\u201cBut how Why How can you possibly know\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause only in that way can the sequence of events be logically explained.",
    "Mon ami I have taken you step by step along the way.",
    "Do you not now see what is so glaringly plain\u201d\n\n\u201cMy dear Poirot I can\u2019t see anything glaring about it.",
    "I did think I was beginning to see my way before but I\u2019m now hopelessly fogged.\u201d\n\nPoirot looked at me sadly and shook his head.",
    "\u201cMon Dieu But it is triste A good intelligence\u2014and so deplorably lacking in method.",
    "There is an exercise most excellent for the development of the little grey cells.",
    "I will impart it to you\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cFor Heaven\u2019s sake not now You really are the most irritating of fellows Poirot.",
    "For goodness\u2019 sake get on and tell me who killed M. Renauld.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is just what I am not sure of as yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you said it was glaringly clear\u201d\n\n\u201cWe talk at crosspurposes my friend.",
    "Remember it is two crimes we are investigating\u2014for which as I pointed out to you we have the necessary two bodies.",
    "There there ne vous impatientez pas I explain all.",
    "To begin with we apply our psychology.",
    "We find three points at which M. Renauld displays a distinct change of view and action\u2014three psychological points therefore.",
    "The first occurs immediately after arriving in Merlinville the second after quarrelling with his son on a certain subject the third on the morning of June 7th.",
    "Now for the three causes.",
    "We can attribute No.",
    "1 to meeting Madame Daubreuil.",
    "No.",
    "2 is indirectly connected with her since it concerns a marriage between M. Renauld\u2019s son and her daughter.",
    "But the cause of No.",
    "3 is hidden from us.",
    "We have to deduce it.",
    "Now mon ami let me ask you a question who do we believe to have planned this crime\u201d\n\n\u201cGeorges Conneau\u201d I said doubtfully eyeing Poirot warily.",
    "\u201cExactly.",
    "Now Giraud laid it down as an axiom that a woman lies to save herself the man she loves and her child.",
    "Since we are satisfied that was Georges Conneau who dictated the lie to her and as Georges Conneau is not Jack Renauld follows that the third case is put out of court.",
    "And still attributing the crime to Georges Conneau the first is equally so.",
    "So we are forced to the second\u2014that Madame Renauld lied for the sake of the man she loved\u2014or in other words for the sake of Georges Conneau.",
    "You agree to that.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes\u201d I admitted.",
    "\u201cIt seems logical enough.\u201d\n\n\u201cBien Madame Renauld loves Georges Conneau.",
    "Who then is Georges Conneau\u201d\n\n\u201cThe tramp.\u201d\n\n\u201cHave we any evidence to show that Madame Renauld loved the tramp\u201d\n\n\u201cNo but\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cVery well then.",
    "Do not cling to theories where facts no longer support them.",
    "Ask yourself instead who Madame Renauld did love.\u201d\n\nI shook my head perplexed.",
    "\u201cMais oui you know perfectly.",
    "Who did Madame Renauld love so dearly that when she saw his dead body she fell down in a swoon\u201d\n\nI stared dumbfounded.",
    "\u201cHer husband\u201d I gasped.",
    "Poirot nodded.",
    "\u201cHer husband\u2014or Georges Conneau whichever you like to call him.\u201d\n\nI rallied myself.",
    "\u201cBut it\u2019s impossible.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow \u2018impossible\u2019 Did we not agree just now that Madame Daubreuil was in a position to blackmail Georges Conneau\u201d\n\n\u201cYes but\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd did she not very effectively blackmail M. Renauld\u201d\n\n\u201cThat may be true enough but\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd is it not a fact that we know nothing of M. Renauld\u2019s youth and upbringing That he springs suddenly into existence as a French Canadian exactly twentytwo years ago\u201d\n\n\u201cAll that is so\u201d I said more firmly \u201cbut you seem to me to be overlooking one salient point.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is it my friend\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy we have admitted Georges Conneau planned the crime.",
    "That brings us to the ridiculous statement that he planned his own murder\u201d\n\n\u201cEh bien mon ami\u201d said Poirot placidly \u201cthat is just what he did do\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n21\n\nHercule Poirot on the Case\n\n\nIn a measured voice Poirot began his exposition.",
    "\u201cIt seems strange to you mon ami that a man should plan his own death So strange that you prefer to reject the truth as fantastic and to revert to a story that is in reality ten times more impossible.",
    "Yes M. Renauld planned his own death but there is one detail that perhaps escapes you\u2014he did not intend to die.\u201d\n\nI shook my head bewildered.",
    "\u201cBut no it is all most simple really\u201d said Poirot kindly.",
    "\u201cFor the crime that M. Renauld proposed a murderer was not necessary as I told you but a body was.",
    "Let us reconstruct seeing events this time from a different angle.",
    "\u201cGeorges Conneau flies from justice\u2014to Canada.",
    "There under an assumed name he marries and finally acquires a vast fortune in South America.",
    "But there is a nostalgia upon him for his own country.",
    "Twenty years have elapsed he is considerably changed in appearance besides being a man of such eminence that no one is likely to connect him with a fugitive from justice many years ago.",
    "He deems it quite safe to return.",
    "He takes up his headquarters in England but intends to spend the summers in France.",
    "And ill fortune that obscure justice which shapes men\u2019s ends and will not allow them to evade the consequences of their acts takes him to Merlinville.",
    "There in the whole of France is the one person who is capable of recognizing him.",
    "It is of course a gold mine to Madame Daubreuil and a gold mine of which she is not slow to take advantage.",
    "He is helpless absolutely in her power.",
    "And she bleeds him heavily.",
    "\u201cAnd then the inevitable happens.",
    "Jack Renauld falls in love with the beautiful girl he sees almost daily and wishes to marry her.",
    "That rouses his father.",
    "At all costs he will prevent his son marrying the daughter of this evil woman.",
    "Jack Renauld knows nothing of his father\u2019s past but Madame Renauld knows everything.",
    "She is a woman of great force of character and passionately devoted to her husband.",
    "They take counsel together.",
    "Renauld sees only one way of escape\u2014death.",
    "He must appear to die in reality escaping to another country where he will start again under an assumed name and where Madame Renauld having played the widow\u2019s part for a while can join him.",
    "It is essential that she should have control of the money so he alters his will.",
    "How they meant to manage the body business originally I do not know\u2014possibly an art student\u2019s skeleton\u2014and a fire or something of the kind but long before their plans have matured an event occurs which plays into their hands.",
    "A rough tramp violent and abusive finds his way into the garden.",
    "There is a struggle M. Renauld seeks to eject him and suddenly the tramp an epileptic falls down in a fit.",
    "He is dead.",
    "M. Renauld calls his wife.",
    "Together they drag him into the shed\u2014as we know the event had occurred just outside\u2014and they realize the marvellous opportunity that has been vouchsafed them.",
    "The man bears no resemblance to M. Renauld but he is middleaged of a usual French type.",
    "That is sufficient.",
    "\u201cI rather fancy that they sat on the bench up there out of earshot from the house discussing matters.",
    "Their plan was quickly made.",
    "The identification must rest solely on Madame Renauld\u2019s evidence.",
    "Jack Renauld and the chauffeur who had been with his master two years must be got out of the way.",
    "It was unlikely that the French women servants would go near the body and in any case Renauld intended to take measures to deceive any one not likely to appreciate details.",
    "Masters was sent off a telegram despatched to Jack Buenos Ayres being selected to give credence to the story that Renauld had decided upon.",
    "Having heard of me as a rather obscure elderly detective he wrote his appeal for help knowing that when I arrived the production of the letter would have a profound effect upon the examining magistrate\u2014which of course it did.",
    "\u201cThey dressed the body of the tramp in a suit of M. Renauld\u2019s and left his ragged coat and trousers by the door of the shed not daring to take them into the house.",
    "And then to give credence to the tale Madame Renauld was to tell they drove the aeroplane dagger through his heart.",
    "That night M. Renauld will first bind and gag his wife and then taking a spade will dig a grave in that particular spot of ground where he knows a\u2014how do you call it bunkair\u2014is to be made.",
    "It is essential that the body should be found\u2014Madame Daubreuil must have no suspicions.",
    "On the other hand if a little time elapses any dangers as to identity will be greatly lessened.",
    "Then M. Renauld will don the tramp\u2019s rags and shuffle off to the station where he will leave unnoticed by the 1210 train.",
    "Since the crime will be supposed to have taken place two hours later no suspicion can possibly attach to him.",
    "\u201cYou see now his annoyance at the inopportune visit of the girl Bella.",
    "Every moment of delay is fatal to his plans.",
    "He gets rid of her as soon as he can however.",
    "Then to work He leaves the front door slightly ajar to create the impression that the assassins left that way.",
    "He binds and gags Madame Renauld correcting his mistake of twentytwo years ago when the looseness of the bonds caused suspicion to fall upon his accomplice but leaving her primed with essentially the same story as he had invented before proving the unconscious recoil of the mind against originality.",
    "The night is chilly and he slips on an overcoat over his underclothing intending to cast it into the grave with the dead man.",
    "He goes out by the window smoothing over the flower bed carefully and thereby furnishing the most positive evidence against himself.",
    "He goes out on to the lonely golf links and he digs\u2014and then\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYes\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd then\u201d said Poirot gravely \u201cthe justice that he has so long eluded overtakes him.",
    "An unknown hand stabs him in the back.",
    "\u2026 Now Hastings you understand what I mean when I talk of two crimes.",
    "The first crime the crime that M. Renauld in his arrogance asked us to investigate ah but he made a famous mistake there He misjudged Hercule Poirot is solved.",
    "But behind it lies a deeper riddle.",
    "And to solve that will be difficult\u2014since the criminal in his wisdom has been content to avail himself of the devices prepared by M. Renauld.",
    "It has been a particularly perplexing and baffling mystery to solve.",
    "A young hand like Giraud who does not place any reliance on the psychology is almost certain to fail.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re marvellous Poirot\u201d I said with admiration.",
    "\u201cAbsolutely marvellous.",
    "No one on earth but you could have done it\u201d\n\nI think my praise pleased him.",
    "For once in his life he looked almost embarrassed.",
    "\u201cAh then you no longer despise poor old Papa Poirot You shift your allegiance back from the human foxhound\u201d\n\nHis term for Giraud never failed to make me smile.",
    "\u201cRather.",

    "That is where la mauvaise chance came in.",
    "Her hair dark originally is almost completely silvered.",
    "It might just as easily have been a grey hair\u2014and then by no conceivable effort could Giraud have persuaded himself it came from the head of Jack Renauld But it is all of a piece.",
    "Always the facts must be twisted to fit the theory Did not Giraud find the traces of two persons a man and a woman in the shed And how does that fit in with his reconstruction of the case I will tell you\u2014it does not fit in and so we shall hear no more of them I ask you is that a methodical way of working The great Giraud The great Giraud is nothing but a toy balloon\u2014swollen with its own importance.",
    "But I Hercule Poirot whom he despises will be the little pin that pricks the big balloon\u2014comme \u00e7a\u201d And he made an expressive gesture.",
    "Then calming down he resumed\n\n\u201cWithout doubt when Madame Renauld recovers she will speak.",
    "The possibility of her son being accused of the murder never occurred to her.",
    "How should it when she believed him safely at sea on board the Anzora Ah voil\u00e0 une femme Hastings What force what selfcommand She only made one slip.",
    "On his unexpected return \u2018It does not matter\u2014now.\u2019 And no one noticed\u2014no one realized the significance of those words.",
    "What a terrible part she has had to play poor woman.",
    "Imagine the shock when she goes to identify the body and instead of what she expects sees the actual lifeless form of the husband she has believed miles away by now.",
    "No wonder she fainted But since then despite her grief and her despair how resolutely she has played her part and how the anguish of it must wring her.",
    "She cannot say a word to set us on the track of the real murderers.",
    "For her son\u2019s sake no one must know that Paul Renauld was Georges Conneau the criminal.",
    "Final and most bitter blow she has admitted publicly that Madame Daubreuil was her husband\u2019s mistress\u2014for a hint of blackmail might be fatal to her secret.",
    "How cleverly she dealt with the examining magistrate when he asked her if there was any mystery in her husband\u2019s past life.",
    "\u2018Nothing so romantic I am sure M. le juge.\u2019 It was perfect the indulgent tone the soup\u00e7on of sad mockery.",
    "At once M. Hautet felt himself foolish and melodramatic.",
    "Yes she is a great woman If she loved a criminal she loved him royally\u201d\n\nPoirot lost himself in contemplation.",
    "\u201cOne thing more Poirot what about the piece of lead piping\u201d\n\n\u201cYou do not see To disfigure the victim\u2019s face so that it would be unrecognizable.",
    "It was that which first set me on the right track.",
    "And that imbecile of a Giraud swarming all over it to look for match ends Did I not tell you that a clue of two feet long was quite as good as a clue of two inches\u201d\n\n\u201cWell Giraud will sing small now\u201d I observed hastily to lead the conversation away from my own shortcomings.",
    "\u201cAs I said before will he If he has arrived at the right person by the wrong method he will not permit that to worry him.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut surely\u2014\u201d I paused as I saw the new trend of things.",
    "\u201cYou see Hastings we must now start again.",
    "Who killed M. Renauld Some one who was near the Villa just before twelve o\u2019clock that night some one who would benefit by his death\u2014the description fits Jack Renauld only too well.",
    "The crime need not have been premeditated.",
    "And then the dagger\u201d\n\nI started I had not realized that point.",
    "\u201cOf course\u201d I said.",
    "\u201cThe second dagger we found in the tramp was Mrs. Renauld\u2019s.",
    "There were two then.\u201d\n\n\u201cCertainly and since they were duplicates it stands to reason that Jack Renauld was the owner.",
    "But that would not trouble me so much.",
    "In fact I have a little idea as to that.",
    "No the worst indictment against him is again psychological\u2014heredity mon ami heredity Like father like son\u2014Jack Renauld when all is said or done is the son of Georges Conneau.\u201d\n\nHis tone was grave and earnest and I was impressed in spite of myself.",
    "\u201cWhat is your little idea that you mentioned just now\u201d I asked.",
    "For answer Poirot consulted his turnipfaced watch and then asked\n\n\u201cWhat time is the afternoon boat from Calais\u201d\n\n\u201cAbout five I believe.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat will do very well.",
    "We shall just have time.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are going to England\u201d\n\n\u201cYes my friend.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy\u201d\n\n\u201cTo find a possible\u2014witness.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho\u201d\n\nWith a rather peculiar smile upon his face Poirot replied\n\n\u201cMiss Bella Duveen.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut how will you find her\u2014what do you know about her\u201d\n\n\u201cI know nothing about her\u2014but I can guess a good deal.",
    "We may take it for granted that her name is Bella Duveen and since that name was faintly familiar to M. Stonor though evidently not in connection with the Renauld family it is probable that she is on the stage.",
    "Jack Renauld was a young man with plenty of money and twenty years of age.",
    "The stage is sure to have been the home of his first love.",
    "It tallies too with M. Renauld\u2019s attempt to placate her with a cheque.",
    "I think I shall find her all right\u2014especially with the help of this.\u201d\n\nAnd he brought out the photograph I had seen him take from Jack Renauld\u2019s drawer.",
    "\u201cWith love from Bella\u201d was scrawled across the corner but it was not that which held my eyes fascinated.",
    "The likeness was not first rate\u2014but for all that it was unmistakable to me.",
    "I felt a cold sinking as though some unutterable calamity had befallen me.",
    "It was the face of Cinderella.",
    "22\n\nI Find Love\n\n\nFor a moment or two I sat as though frozen the photograph still in my hand.",
    "Then summoning all my courage to appear unmoved I handed it back.",
    "At the same time I stole a quick glance at Poirot.",
    "Had he noticed anything But to my relief he did not seem to be observing me.",
    "Anything unusual in my manner had certainly escaped him.",
    "He rose briskly to his feet.",
    "\u201cWe have no time to lose.",
    "We must make our departure with all despatch.",
    "All is well\u2014the sea it will be calm\u201d\n\nIn the bustle of departure I had no time for thinking but once on board the boat secure from Poirot\u2019s observation he as usual was \u201cpractising the method most excellent of Laverguier\u201d I pulled myself together and attacked the facts dispassionately.",
    "How much did Poirot know Was he aware that my acquaintance of the train and Bella Duveen were one and the same Why had he gone to the H\u00f4tel du Phare On my behalf as I had believed Or had I only fatuously thought so and was this visit undertaken with a deeper and more sinister purpose\n\nBut in any case why was he bent on finding this girl Did he suspect her of having seen Jack Renauld commit the crime Or did he suspect\u2014but that was impossible The girl had no grudge against the elder Renauld no possible motive for wishing his death.",
    "What had brought her back to the scene of the murder I went over the facts carefully.",
    "She must have left the train at Calais where I parted from her that day.",
    "No wonder I had been unable to find her on the boat.",
    "If she had dined in Calais and then taken a train out to Merlinville she would have arrived at the Villa Genevi\u00e8ve just about the time that Fran\u00e7oise said.",
    "What had she done when she left the house just after ten Presumably either gone to an hotel or returned to Calais.",
    "And then The crime had been committed on Tuesday night.",
    "On Thursday morning she was once more in Merlinville.",
    "Had she ever left France at all I doubted it very much.",
    "What kept her there\u2014the hope of seeing Jack Renauld I had told her as at the time we believed that he was on the high seas en route to Buenos Ayres.",
    "Possibly she was aware that the Anzora had not sailed.",
    "But to know that she must have seen Jack.",
    "Was that what Poirot was after Had Jack Renauld returning to see Marthe Daubreuil come face to face instead with Bella Duveen the girl he had heartlessly thrown over\n\nI began to see daylight.",
    "If that were indeed the case it might furnish Jack with the alibi he needed.",
    "Yet under those circumstances his silence seemed difficult to explain.",
    "Why could he not have spoken out boldly Did he fear for this former entanglement of his to come to the ears of Marthe Daubreuil I shook my head dissatisfied.",
    "The thing had been harmless enough a foolish boy and girl affair and I reflected cynically that the son of a millionaire was not likely to be thrown over by a penniless French girl who moreover loved him devotedly without a much graver cause.",
    "Altogether I found the affair puzzling and unsatisfactory.",
    "I disliked intensely being associated with Poirot in hunting this girl down but I could not see any way of avoiding it without revealing everything to him and this for some reason I was loath to do.",
    "Poirot reappeared brisk and smiling at Dover and our journey to London was uneventful.",
    "It was past nine o\u2019clock when we arrived and I supposed that we should return straight away to our rooms and do nothing till the morning.",
    "But Poirot had other plans.",
    "\u201cWe must lose no time mon ami.",
    "The news of the arrest will not be in the English papers until the day after tomorrow but still we must lose no time.\u201d\n\nI did not quite follow his reasoning but I merely asked how he proposed to find the girl.",
    "\u201cYou remember Joseph Aarons the theatrical agent No I assisted him in a little matter of a Japanese wrestler.",
    "A pretty little problem I must recount it to you one day.",
    "He without doubt will be able to put us in the way of finding out what we want to know.\u201d\n\nIt took us some time to run Mr. Aarons to earth and it was after midnight when we finally managed it.",
    "He greeted Poirot with every evidence of warmth and professed himself ready to be of service to us in any way.",
    "\u201cThere\u2019s not much about the profession I don\u2019t know\u201d he said beaming genially.",
    "\u201cEh bien M. Aarons I desire to find a young girl called Bella Duveen.\u201d\n\n\u201cBella Duveen.",
    "I know the name but for the moment I can\u2019t place it.",
    "What\u2019s her line\u201d\n\n\u201cThat I do not know\u2014but here is her photograph.\u201d\n\nMr. Aarons studied it for a moment then his face lighted.",
    "\u201cGot it\u201d He slapped his thigh.",
    "\u201cThe Dulcibella Kids by the Lord\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Dulcibella Kids\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s it.",
    "They\u2019re sisters.",
    "Acrobats dancers and singers.",
    "Give quite a good little turn.",
    "They\u2019re in the provinces somewhere I believe\u2014if they\u2019re not resting.",
    "They\u2019ve been on in Paris for the last two or three weeks.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan you find out for me exactly where they are\u201d\n\n\u201cEasy as a bird.",
    "You go home and I\u2019ll send you round the dope in the morning.\u201d\n\nWith this promise we took leave of him.",
    "He was as good as his word.",
    "About eleven o\u2019clock the following day a scribbled note reached us.",
    "\u201cThe Dulcibella Sisters are on at the Palace in Coventry.",
    "Good luck to you.\u201d\n\nWithout more ado we started for Coventry.",
    "Poirot made no inquiries at the theatre but contented himself with booking stalls for the variety performance that evening.",
    "The show was wearisome beyond words\u2014or perhaps it was only my mood that made it seem so.",
    "Japanese families balanced themselves precariously wouldbe fashionable men in greenish evening dress and exquisitely slicked hair reeled off society patter and danced marvellously stout prima donnas sang at the top of the human register a comic comedian endeavoured to be Mr. George Robey and failed signally.",
    "At last the number went up which announced the Dulcibella Kids.",
    "My heart beat sickeningly.",
    "There she was\u2014there they both were the pair of them one flaxen haired one dark matching as to size with short fluffy skirts and immense buster brown bows.",
    "They looked a pair of extremely piquant children.",
    "They began to sing.",
    "Their voices were fresh and true rather thin and musichally but attractive.",
    "It was quite a pretty little turn.",
    "They danced neatly and did some clever little acrobatic feats.",
    "The words of their songs were crisp and catchy.",
    "When the curtain fell there was a full meed of applause.",
    "Evidently the Dulcibella Kids were a success.",
    "Suddenly I felt that I could remain no longer.",
    "I must get out into the air.",
    "I suggested leaving to Poirot.",
    "\u201cGo by all means mon ami.",
    "I amuse myself and will stay to the end.",
    "I will rejoin you later.\u201d\n\nIt was only a few steps from the theatre to the hotel.",
    "I went up to the sittingroom ordered a whisky and soda and sat drinking it staring meditatively into the empty grate.",
    "I heard the door open and turned my head thinking it was Poirot.",
    "Then I jumped to my feet.",
    "It was Cinderella who stood in the doorway.",
    "She spoke haltingly her breath coming in little gasps.",
    "\u201cI saw you in front.",
    "You and your friend.",
    "When you got up to go I was waiting outside and followed you.",
    "Why are you here\u2014in Coventry What were you doing there tonight Is the man who was with you the\u2014the detective\u201d\n\nShe stood there the cloak she had wrapped round her stage dress slipping from her shoulders.",
    "I saw the whiteness of her cheeks under the rouge and heard the terror in her voice.",
    "And in that moment I understood everything\u2014understood why Poirot was seeking her and what she feared and understood at last my own heart.",
    "\u2026\n\n\u201cYes\u201d I said gently.",
    "\u201cIs he looking for\u2014me\u201d she half whispered.",
    "Then as I did not answer for a moment she slipped down by the big chair and burst into violent bitter weeping.",
    "I knelt down by her holding her in my arms and smoothing the hair back from her face.",
    "\u201cDon\u2019t cry child don\u2019t cry for God\u2019s sake.",
    "You\u2019re safe here.",
    "I\u2019ll take care of you.",
    "Don\u2019t cry darling.",
    "Don\u2019t cry.",
    "I know\u2014I know everything.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh but you don\u2019t\u201d\n\n\u201cI think I do.\u201d And after a moment as her sobs grew quieter I asked \u201cIt was you who took the dagger wasn\u2019t it\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat was why you wanted me to show you round And why you pretended to faint\u201d\n\nAgain she nodded.",
    "It was a strange thought to come to me at the moment but it shot into my mind that I was glad her motive was what it had been\u2014rather than the idle and morbid curiosity I had accused her of at the time.",
    "How gallantly she had played her part that day inwardly racked with fear and trepidation as she must have been.",
    "Poor little soul bearing the burden of a moment\u2019s impetuous action.",
    "\u201cWhy did you take the dagger\u201d I asked presently.",
    "She replied as simply as a child\n\n\u201cI was afraid there might be fingermarks on it.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut didn\u2019t you remember that you had worn gloves\u201d\n\nShe shook her head as though bewildered and then said slowly\n\n\u201cAre you going to give me up to\u2014to the Police\u201d\n\n\u201cGood God no.\u201d\n\nHer eyes sought mine long and earnestly and then she asked in a little quiet voice that sounded afraid of itself\n\n\u201cWhy not\u201d\n\nIt seemed a strange place and a strange time for a declaration of love\u2014and God knows in all my imagining I had never pictured love coming to me in such a guise.",
    "But I answered simply and naturally enough\n\n\u201cBecause I love you Cinderella.\u201d\n\nShe bent her head down as though ashamed and muttered in a broken voice\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t\u2014you can\u2019t\u2014not if you knew\u2014\u201d And then as though rallying herself she faced me squarely and asked\n\n\u201cWhat do you know then\u201d\n\n\u201cI know that you came to see Mr. Renauld that night.",
    "He offered you a cheque and you tore it up indignantly.",
    "Then you left the house\u2014\u201d I paused.",
    "\u201cGo on\u2014what next\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know whether you knew that Jack Renauld would be coming that night or whether you just waited about on the chance of seeing him but you did wait about.",
    "Perhaps you were just miserable and walked aimlessly\u2014but at any rate just before twelve you were still near there and you saw a man on the golf links\u2014\u201d\n\nAgain I paused.",
    "I had leapt to the truth in a flash as she entered the room but now the picture rose before me even more convincingly.",
    "I saw vividly the peculiar pattern of the overcoat on the dead body of Mr. Renauld and I remembered the amazing likeness that had startled me into believing for one instant that the dead man had risen from the dead when his son burst into our conclave in the salon.",
    "\u201cGo on\u201d repeated the girl steadily.",
    "\u201cI fancy his back was to you\u2014but you recognized him or thought you recognized him.",
    "The gait and the carriage were familiar to you and the pattern of his overcoat.\u201d I paused.",
    "\u201cYou told me in the train on the way from Paris that you had Italian blood in your veins and that you had nearly got into trouble once with it.",
    "You used a threat in one of your letters to Jack Renauld.",
    "When you saw him there your anger and jealousy drove you mad\u2014and you struck I don\u2019t believe for a minute that you meant to kill him.",
    "But you did kill him Cinderella.\u201d\n\nShe had flung up her hands to cover her face and in a choked voice she said\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re right\u200a\u2026 you\u2019re right\u200a\u2026 I can see it all as you tell it.\u201d Then she turned on me almost savagely.",
    "\u201cAnd you love me Knowing what you do how can you love me\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d I said a little wearily.",
    "\u201cI think love is like that\u2014a thing one cannot help.",
    "I have tried I know\u2014ever since the first day I met you.",
    "And love has been too strong for me.\u201d\n\nAnd then suddenly when I least expected it she broke down again casting herself down on the floor and sobbing wildly.",
    "\u201cOh I can\u2019t\u201d she cried.",
    "\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do.",
    "I don\u2019t know which way to turn.",
    "Oh pity me pity me some one and tell me what to do\u201d\n\nAgain I knelt by her soothing her as best I could.",
    "\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid of me Bella.",
    "For God\u2019s sake don\u2019t be afraid of me.",
    "I love you that\u2019s true\u2014but I don\u2019t want anything in return.",
    "Only let me help you.",
    "Love him still if you have to but let me help you as he can\u2019t.\u201d\n\nIt was as though she had been turned to stone by my words.",
    "She raised her head from her hands and stared at me.",
    "\u201cYou think that\u201d she whispered.",
    "\u201cYou think that I love Jack Renauld\u201d\n\nThen half laughing half crying she flung her arms passionately round my neck and pressed her sweet wet face to mine.",
    "\u201cNot as I love you\u201d she whispered.",
    "\u201cNever as I love you\u201d\n\nHer lips brushed my cheek and then seeking my mouth kissed me again and again with a sweetness and fire beyond belief.",
    "The wildness of it\u2014and the wonder I shall not forget\u2014no not as long as I live\n\nIt was a sound in the doorway that made us look up.",
    "Poirot was standing there looking at us.",
    "I did not hesitate.",
    "With a bound I reached him and pinioned his arms to his sides.",
    "\u201cQuick\u201d I said to the girl.",
    "\u201cGet out of here.",
    "As fast as you can.",
    "I\u2019ll hold him.\u201d\n\nWith one look at me she fled out of the room past us.",
    "I held Poirot in a grip of iron.",
    "\u201cMon ami\u201d observed the latter mildly \u201cyou do this sort of thing very well.",
    "The strong man holds me in his grasp and I am helpless as a child.",
    "But all this is uncomfortable and slightly ridiculous.",
    "Let us sit down and be calm.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou won\u2019t pursue her\u201d\n\n\u201cMon Dieu no.",
    "Am I Giraud Release me my friend.\u201d\n\nKeeping a suspicious eye upon him for I paid Poirot the compliment of knowing that I was no match for him in astuteness I relaxed my grip and he sank into an armchair feeling his arms tenderly.",
    "\u201cIt is that you have the strength of a bull when you are roused Hastings Eh bien and do you think you have behaved well to your old friend I show you the girl\u2019s photograph and you recognize it but you never say a word.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere was no need if you knew that I recognized it\u201d I said rather bitterly.",
    "So Poirot had known all along I had not deceived him for an instant.",
    "\u201cTata You did not know that I knew that.",
    "And tonight you help the girl to escape when we have found her with so much trouble Eh bien it comes to this\u2014are you going to work with me or against me Hastings\u201d\n\nFor a moment or two I did not answer.",
    "To break with my old friend gave me great pain.",
    "Yet I must definitely range myself against him.",
    "Would he ever forgive me I wondered He had been strangely calm so far but I knew him to possess marvellous selfcommand.",
    "\u201cPoirot\u201d I said \u201cI\u2019m sorry.",
    "I admit I\u2019ve behaved badly to you over this.",
    "But sometimes one has no choice.",
    "And in future I must take my own line.\u201d\n\nPoirot nodded his head several times.",
    "\u201cI understand\u201d he said.",
    "The mocking light had quite died out of his eyes and he spoke with a sincerity and kindness that surprised me.",
    "\u201cIt is that my friend is it not It is love that has come\u2014not as you imagined it all cock a hoop with fine feathers but sadly with bleeding feet.",
    "Well well\u2014I warned you.",
    "When I realized that this girl must have taken the dagger I warned you.",
    "Perhaps you remember.",
    "But already it was too late.",
    "But tell me how much do you know\u201d\n\nI met his eyes squarely.",
    "\u201cNothing that you could tell me would be any surprise to me Poirot.",
    "Understand that.",
    "But in case you think of resuming your search for Miss Duveen I should like you to know one thing clearly.",
    "If you have any idea that she was concerned in the crime or was the mysterious lady who called upon Mr. Renauld that night you are wrong.",
    "I travelled home from France with her that day and parted from her at Victoria that evening so that it is clearly impossible for her to have been in Merlinville.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh\u201d Poirot looked at me thoughtfully.",
    "\u201cAnd you would swear to that in a court of law\u201d\n\n\u201cMost certainly I would.\u201d\n\nPoirot rose and bowed.",
    "\u201cMon ami Vive l\u2019amour It can perform miracles.",
    "It is decidedly ingenious what you have thought of there.",
    "It defeats even Hercule Poirot\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n23\n\nDifficulties Ahead\n\n\nAfter a moment of stress such as I have just described reaction is bound to set in.",
    "I retired to rest that night on a note of triumph but I awoke to realize that I was by no means out of the wood.",
    "True I could see no flaw in the alibi I had so suddenly conceived.",
    "I had but to stick to my story and I failed to see how Bella could be convicted in face of it.",
    "It was not as though there was any old friendship between us that could be raked up and which might lead them to suspect that I was committing perjury.",
    "It could be proved that in actual fact I had only seen the girl on three occasions.",
    "No I was still satisfied with my idea\u2014had not even Poirot admitted that it defeated him\n\nBut there I felt the need of treading warily.",
    "All very well for my little friend to admit himself momentarily nonplussed.",
    "I had far too much respect for his abilities to conceive of him as being content to remain in that position.",
    "I had a very humble opinion of my wits when it came to matching them against his.",
    "Poirot would not take defeat lying down.",
    "Somehow or other he would endeavour to turn the tables on me and that in the way and at the moment when I least expected it.",
    "We met at breakfast the following morning as though nothing had happened.",
    "Poirot\u2019s good temper was imperturbable yet I thought I detected a film of reserve in his manner which was new.",
    "After breakfast I announced my intention of going out for a stroll.",
    "A malicious gleam shot through Poirot\u2019s eyes.",
    "\u201cIf it is information you seek you need not be at the pains of deranging yourself.",
    "I can tell you all you wish to know.",
    "The Dulcibella Sisters have cancelled their contract and have left Coventry for an unknown destination.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs that really so Poirot\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can take it from me Hastings.",
    "I made inquiries the first thing this morning.",
    "After all what else did you expect\u201d\n\nTrue enough nothing else could be expected under the circumstances.",
    "Cinderella had profited by the slight start I had been able to assure her and would certainly not lose a moment in removing herself from the reach of the pursuer.",
    "It was what I had intended and planned.",
    "Nevertheless I was aware of being plunged into a network of fresh difficulties.",
    "I had absolutely no means of communicating with the girl and it was vital that she should know the line of defence that had occurred to me and which I was prepared to carry out.",
    "Of course it was possible that she might try to send word to me in some way or another but I hardly thought it likely.",
    "She would know the risk she ran of a message being intercepted by Poirot thus setting him on her track once more.",
    "Clearly her only course was to disappear utterly for the time being.",
    "But in the meantime what was Poirot doing I studied him attentively.",
    "He was wearing his most innocent air and staring meditatively into the far distance.",
    "He looked altogether too placid and supine to give me reassurance.",
    "I had learned with Poirot that the less dangerous he looked the more dangerous he was.",
    "His quiescence alarmed me.",
    "Observing a troubled quality in my glance he smiled benignantly.",
    "\u201cYou are puzzled Hastings You ask yourself why I do not launch myself in pursuit\u201d\n\n\u201cWell\u2014something of the kind.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is what you would do were you in my place.",
    "I understand that.",
    "But I am not of those who enjoy rushing up and down a country seeking a needle in a haystack as you English say.",
    "No\u2014let Mademoiselle Bella Duveen go.",
    "Without doubt I shall be able to find her when the time comes.",
    "Until then I am content to wait.\u201d\n\nI stared at him doubtfully.",
    "Was he seeking to mislead me I had an irritating feeling that even now he was master of the situation.",
    "My sense of superiority was gradually waning.",
    "I had contrived the girl\u2019s escape and evolved a brilliant scheme for saving her from the consequences of her rash act\u2014but I could not rest easy in my mind.",
    "Poirot\u2019s perfect calm awakened a thousand apprehensions.",
    "\u201cI suppose Poirot\u201d I said rather diffidently \u201cI mustn\u2019t ask what your plans are I\u2019ve forfeited the right.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut not at all.",
    "There is no secret about them.",
    "We return to France without delay.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u201d\n\n\u201cPrecisely\u2014\u2018we\u2019 You know very well that you cannot afford to let Papa Poirot out of your sight.",
    "Eh is it not so my friend But remain in England by all means if you wish\u2014\u201d\n\nI shook my head.",
    "He had hit the nail on the head.",
    "I could not afford to let him out of my sight.",
    "Although I could not expect his confidence after what had happened I could still check his actions.",
    "The only danger to Bella lay with him.",
    "Giraud and the French police were indifferent to her existence.",
    "At all costs I must keep near Poirot.",
    "Poirot observed me attentively as these reflections passed through my mind and gave a nod of satisfaction.",
    "\u201cI am right am I not And as you are quite capable of trying to follow me disguised with some absurdity such as a false beard\u2014which every one would perceive bien entendu\u2014I much prefer that we should voyage together.",
    "It would annoy me greatly that any one should mock themselves at you.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery well then.",
    "But it\u2019s only fair to warn you\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI know\u2014I know all.",
    "You are my enemy Be my enemy then.",
    "It does not worry me at all.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo long as it\u2019s all fair and aboveboard I don\u2019t mind.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have to the full the English passion for \u2018fairplay\u2019 Now your scruples are satisfied let us depart immediately.",
    "There is no time to be lost.",
    "Our stay in England has been short but sufficient.",
    "I know\u2014what I wanted to know.\u201d\n\nThe tone was light but I read a veiled menace into the words.",
    "\u201cStill\u2014\u201d I began and stopped.",
    "\u201cStill\u2014as you say Without doubt you are satisfied with the part you are playing.",
    "Me I preoccupy myself with Jack Renauld.\u201d\n\nJack Renauld The words gave me a start.",
    "I had completely forgotten that aspect of the case.",
    "Jack Renauld in prison with the shadow of the guillotine looming over him I saw the part I was playing in a more sinister light.",
    "I could save Bella\u2014yes but in doing so I ran the risk of sending an innocent man to his death.",
    "I pushed the thought from me with horror.",
    "It could not be.",
    "He would be acquitted.",
    "Certainly he would be acquitted But the cold fear came back.",
    "Suppose he were not What then Could I have it on my conscience\u2014horrible thought Would it come to that in the end A decision.",
    "Bella or Jack Renauld The promptings of my heart were to save the girl I loved at any cost to myself.",
    "But if the cost were to another the problem was altered.",
    "What would the girl herself say I remembered that no word of Jack Renauld\u2019s arrest had passed my lips.",
    "As yet she was in total ignorance of the fact that her former lover was in prison charged with a hideous crime which he had not committed.",
    "When she knew how would she act Would she permit her life to be saved at the expense of his Certainly she must do nothing rash.",
    "Jack Renauld might and probably would be acquitted without any intervention on her part.",
    "If so good.",
    "But if he was not.",
    "\u2026 That was the terrible the unanswerable problem.",
    "I fancied that she ran no risk of the extreme penalty.",
    "The circumstances of the crime were quite different in her case.",
    "She could plead jealousy and extreme provocation and her youth and beauty would go for much.",
    "The fact that by a tragic mistake it was old Mr. Renauld and not his son who paid the penalty would not alter the motive of the crime.",
    "But in any case however lenient the sentence of the Court it must mean a long term of imprisonment.",
    "No Bella must be protected.",
    "And at the same time Jack Renauld must be saved.",
    "How this was to be accomplished I did not see clearly.",
    "But I pinned my faith to Poirot.",
    "He knew.",
    "Come what might he would manage to save an innocent man.",
    "He must find some pretext other than the real one.",
    "It might be difficult but he would manage it somehow.",
    "And with Bella unsuspected and Jack Renauld acquitted all would end satisfactorily.",
    "So I told myself repeatedly but at the bottom of my heart there still remained a cold fear.",
    "24\n\n\u201cSave Him\u201d\n\n\nWe crossed from England by the evening boat and the following morning saw us in SaintOmer whither Jack Renauld had been taken.",
    "Poirot lost no time in visiting M. Hautet.",
    "As he did not seem disposed to make any objections to my accompanying him I bore him company.",
    "After various formalities and preliminaries we were conducted to the examining magistrate\u2019s room.",
    "He greeted us cordially.",
    "\u201cI was told that you had returned to England M. Poirot.",
    "I am glad to find that such is not the case.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is true that I went there M. le juge but it was only for a flying visit.",
    "A side issue but one that I fancied might repay investigation.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd it did\u2014eh\u201d\n\nPoirot shrugged his shoulders.",
    "M. Hautet nodded sighing.",
    "\u201cWe must resign ourselves I fear.",
    "That animal Giraud his manners are abominable but he is undoubtedly clever Not much chance of that one making a mistake.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou think not M. le juge\u201d\n\nIt was the examining magistrate\u2019s turn to shrug his shoulders.",
    "\u201cEh bien speaking frankly\u2014in confidence c\u2019est entendu\u2014can you come to any other conclusion\u201d\n\n\u201cFrankly M. le juge there seem to me to be many points that are obscure.\u201d\n\n\u201cSuch as\u2014\u201d\n\nBut Poirot was not to be drawn.",
    "\u201cI have not yet tabulated them\u201d he remarked.",
    "\u201cIt was a general reflection that I was making.",
    "I liked the young man and should be sorry to believe him guilty of such a hideous crime.",
    "By the way what has he to say for himself on the matter\u201d\n\nThe magistrate frowned.",
    "\u201cI cannot understand him.",
    "He seems incapable of putting up any sort of defence.",
    "It has been most difficult to get him to answer questions.",
    "He contents himself with a general denial and beyond that takes refuge in a most obstinate silence.",
    "I am interrogating him again tomorrow perhaps you would like to be present\u201d\n\nWe accepted the invitation with empressement.",
    "\u201cA distressing case\u201d said the magistrate with a sigh.",
    "\u201cMy sympathy for Madame Renauld is profound.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow is Madame Renauld\u201d\n\n\u201cShe has not yet recovered consciousness.",
    "It is merciful in a way poor woman she is being spared much.",
    "The doctors say that there is no danger but that when she comes to herself she must be kept as quiet as possible.",
    "It was I understand quite as much the shock as the fall which caused her present state.",
    "It would be terrible if her brain became unhinged but I should not wonder at all\u2014no really not at all.\u201d\n\nM. Hautet leaned back shaking his head with a sort of mournful enjoyment as he envisaged the gloomy prospect.",
    "He roused himself at length and observed with a start.",
    "\u201cThat reminds me.",
    "I have here a letter for you M. Poirot.",
    "Let me see where did I put it\u201d\n\nHe proceeded to rummage amongst his papers.",
    "At last he found the missive and handed it to Poirot.",
    "\u201cIt was sent under cover to me in order that I might forward it to you\u201d he explained.",
    "\u201cBut as you left no address I could not do so.\u201d\n\nPoirot studied the letter curiously.",
    "It was addressed in a long sloping foreign hand and the writing was decidedly a woman\u2019s.",
    "Poirot did not open it.",
    "Instead he put it in his pocket and rose to his feet.",
    "\u201cA demain then M. le juge.",
    "Many thanks for your courtesy and amiability.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut not at all.",
    "I am always at your service.",
    "These young detectives of the school of Giraud they are all alike\u2014rude sneering fellows.",
    "They do not realize that an examining magistrate of my\u2014er\u2014experience is bound to have a certain discernment a certain\u2014flair.",
    "Enfin the politeness of the old school is infinitely more to my taste.",
    "Therefore my dear friend command me in any way you will.",
    "We know a thing or two you and I\u2014eh\u201d\n\nAnd laughing heartily enchanted with himself and with us M. Hautet bade us adieu.",
    "I am sorry to have to record that Poirot\u2019s first remark to me as we traversed the corridor was\n\n\u201cA famous old imbecile that one Of a stupidity to make pity\u201d\n\nWe were just leaving the building when we came face to face with Giraud looking more dandified than ever and thoroughly pleased with himself.",
    "\u201cAha M. Poirot\u201d he cried airily.",
    "\u201cYou have returned from England then\u201d\n\n\u201cAs you see\u201d said Poirot.",
    "\u201cThe end of the case is not far off now I fancy.\u201d\n\n\u201cI agree with you M. Giraud.\u201d\n\nPoirot spoke in a subdued tone.",
    "His crestfallen manner seemed to delight the other.",
    "\u201cOf all the milk and water criminals Not an idea of defending himself.",
    "It is extraordinary\u201d\n\n\u201cSo extraordinary that it gives one to think does it not\u201d suggested Poirot mildly.",
    "But Giraud was not even listening.",
    "He twirled his cane amicably.",
    "\u201cWell good day M. Poirot.",
    "I am glad you\u2019re satisfied of young Renauld\u2019s guilt at last.\u201d\n\n\u201cPardon But I am not in the least satisfied.",
    "Jack Renauld is innocent.\u201d\n\nGiraud stared for a moment\u2014then burst out laughing tapping his head significantly with the brief remark \u201cToqu\u00e9\u201d\n\nPoirot drew himself up.",
    "A dangerous light showed in his eyes.",
    "\u201cM.",
    "Giraud throughout the case your manner to me has been deliberately insulting You need teaching a lesson.",
    "I am prepared to wager you 500 francs that I find the murderer of M. Renauld before you do.",
    "Is it agreed\u201d\n\nGiraud stared helplessly at him and murmured again\n\n\u201cToqu\u00e9\u201d\n\n\u201cCome now\u201d urged Poirot \u201cis it agreed\u201d\n\n\u201cI have no wish to take your money from you.\u201d\n\n\u201cMake your mind easy\u2014you will not\u201d\n\n\u201cOh well then I agree You speak of my manner to you being insulting.",
    "Eh bien once or twice your manner has annoyed me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am enchanted to hear it\u201d said Poirot.",
    "\u201cGood morning M. Giraud.",
    "Come Hastings.\u201d\n\nI said no word as we walked along the street.",
    "My heart was heavy.",
    "Poirot had displayed his intentions only too plainly.",
    "I doubted more than ever my powers of saving Bella from the consequences of her act.",
    "This unlucky encounter with Giraud had roused Poirot and put him on his mettle.",
    "Suddenly I felt a hand laid on my shoulder and turned to face Gabriel Stonor.",
    "We stopped and greeted him and he proposed strolling with us back to our hotel.",
    "\u201cAnd what are you doing here M. Stonor\u201d inquired Poirot.",
    "\u201cOne must stand by one\u2019s friends\u201d replied the other dryly.",
    "\u201cEspecially when they are unjustly accused.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen you do not believe that Jack Renauld committed the crime\u201d I asked eagerly.",
    "\u201cCertainly I don\u2019t.",
    "I know the lad.",
    "I admit that there have been one or two things in this business that have staggered me completely but none the less in spite of his fool way of taking it I\u2019ll never believe that Jack Renauld is a murderer.\u201d\n\nMy heart warmed to the secretary.",
    "His words seemed to lift a secret weight from my heart.",
    "\u201cI have no doubt that many people feel as you do\u201d I exclaimed.",
    "\u201cThere is really absurdly little evidence against him.",
    "I should say that there was no doubt of his acquittal\u2014no doubt whatever.\u201d\n\nBut Stonor hardly responded as I could have wished.",
    "\u201cI\u2019d give a lot to think as you do\u201d he said gravely.",
    "He turned to Poirot.",
    "\u201cWhat\u2019s your opinion monsieur\u201d\n\n\u201cI think that things look very black against him\u201d said Poirot quietly.",
    "\u201cYou believe him guilty\u201d said Stonor sharply.",
    "\u201cNo.",
    "But I think he will find it hard to prove his innocence.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s behaving so damned queerly\u201d muttered Stonor.",
    "\u201cOf course I realize that there\u2019s a lot more in this affair than meets the eye.",
    "Giraud\u2019s not wise to that because he\u2019s an outsider but the whole thing has been damned odd.",
    "As to that least said soonest mended.",
    "If Mrs. Renauld wants to hush anything up I\u2019ll take my cue from her.",
    "It\u2019s her show and I\u2019ve too much respect for her judgment to shove my oar in but I can\u2019t get behind this attitude of Jack\u2019s.",
    "Any one would think he wanted to be thought guilty.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s absurd\u201d I cried bursting in.",
    "\u201cFor one thing the dagger\u2014\u201d I paused uncertain as to how much Poirot would wish me to reveal.",
    "I continued choosing my words carefully \u201cWe know that the dagger could not have been in Jack Renauld\u2019s possession that evening.",
    "Mrs. Renauld knows that.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrue\u201d said Stonor.",
    "\u201cWhen she recovers she will doubtless say all this and more.",
    "Well I must be leaving you.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne moment.\u201d Poirot\u2019s hand arrested his departure.",
    "\u201cCan you arrange for word to be sent to me at once should Madame Renauld recover consciousness\u201d\n\n\u201cCertainly.",
    "That\u2019s easily done.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat point about the dagger is good Poirot\u201d I urged as we went upstairs.",
    "\u201cI couldn\u2019t speak very plainly before Stonor.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat was quite right of you.",
    "We might as well keep the knowledge to ourselves as long as we can.",
    "As to the dagger your point hardly helps Jack Renauld.",
    "You remember that I was absent for an hour this morning before we started from London\u201d\n\n\u201cYes\u201d\n\n\u201cWell I was employed in trying to find the firm Jack Renauld employed to convert his souvenirs.",
    "It was not very difficult.",
    "Eh bien Hastings they made to his order not two paperknives but three.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo that\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cSo that after giving one to his mother and one to Bella Duveen there was a third which he doubtless retained for his own use.",
    "No Hastings I fear the dagger question will not help us to save him from the guillotine.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt won\u2019t come to that\u201d I cried stung.",
    "Poirot shook his head uncertainly.",
    "\u201cYou will save him\u201d I cried positively.",
    "Poirot glanced at me dryly.",
    "\u201cHave you not rendered it impossible mon ami\u201d\n\n\u201cSome other way\u201d I muttered.",
    "\u201cAh Sapristi But it is miracles you ask from me.",
    "No\u2014say no more.",
    "Let us instead see what is in this letter.\u201d\n\nAnd he drew out the envelope from his breast pocket.",
    "His face contracted as he read then he handed the one flimsy sheet to me.",
    "\u201cThere are other women in the world who suffer Hastings.\u201d\n\nThe writing was blurred and the note had evidently been written in great agitation\n\n\u201cDear M. Poirot\n\n\u201cIf you get this I beg of you to come to my aid.",
    "I have no one to turn to and at all costs Jack must be saved.",
    "I implore of you on my knees to help us.",
    "\u201cMARTHE DAUBREUIL.\u201d\n\nI handed it back moved.",
    "\u201cYou will go\u201d\n\n\u201cAt once.",
    "We will command an auto.\u201d\n\nHalf an hour later saw us at the Villa Marguerite.",
    "Marthe was at the door to meet us and led Poirot in clinging with both hands to one of his.",
    "\u201cAh you have come\u2014it is good of you.",
    "I have been in despair not knowing what to do.",
    "They will not let me go to see him in prison even.",
    "I suffer horribly I am nearly mad.",
    "Is it true what they say that he does not deny the crime But that is madness.",
    "It is impossible that he should have done it Never for one minute will I believe it.\u201d\n\n\u201cNeither do I believe it mademoiselle\u201d said Poirot gently.",
    "\u201cBut then why does he not speak I do not understand.\u201d\n\n\u201cPerhaps because he is screening some one\u201d suggested Poirot watching her.",
    "Marthe frowned.",
    "\u201cScreening some one Do you mean his mother Ah from the beginning I have suspected her.",
    "Who inherits all that vast fortune She does.",
    "It is easy to wear widow\u2019s weeds and play the hypocrite.",
    "And they say that when he was arrested she fell down\u2014like that.\u201d She made a dramatic gesture.",
    "\u201cAnd without doubt M. Stonor the secretary he helped her.",
    "They are thick as thieves those two.",
    "It is true she is older than he\u2014but what do men care\u2014if a woman is rich\u201d\n\nThere was a hint of bitterness in her tone.",
    "\u201cStonor was in England\u201d I put in.",
    "\u201cHe says so\u2014but who knows\u201d\n\n\u201cMademoiselle\u201d said Poirot quietly \u201cif we are to work together you and I we must have things clear.",
    "First I will ask you a question.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes monsieur\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you aware of your mother\u2019s real name\u201d\n\nMarthe looked at him for a minute then letting her head fall forward on her arms she burst into tears.",
    "\u201cThere there\u201d said Poirot patting her on the shoulder.",
    "\u201cCalm yourself petite I see that you know.",
    "Now a second question did you know who M. Renauld was\u201d\n\n\u201cM.",
    "Renauld\u201d she raised her head from her hands and gazed at him wonderingly.",
    "\u201cAh I see you do not know that.",
    "Now listen to me carefully.\u201d\n\nStep by step he went over the case much as he had done to me on the day of our departure for England.",
    "Marthe listened spellbound.",
    "When he had finished she drew a long breath.",
    "\u201cBut you are wonderful\u2014magnificent You are the greatest detective in the world.\u201d\n\nWith a swift gesture she slipped off her chair and knelt before him with an abandonment that was wholly French.",
    "\u201cSave him monsieur\u201d she cried.",
    "\u201cI love him so.",
    "Oh save him save him\u2014save him\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n25\n\nAn Unexpected D\u00e9nouement\n\n\nWe were present the following morning at the examination of Jack Renauld.",
    "Short as the time had been I was shocked at the change that had taken place in the young prisoner.",
    "His cheeks had fallen in there were deep black circles round his eyes and he looked haggard and distraught as one who had wooed sleep in vain for several nights.",
    "He betrayed no emotion at seeing us.",
    "The prisoner and his counsel Ma\u00eetre Gros\u00eder were accommodated with chairs.",
    "A formidable guard with resplendent sabre stood before the door.",
    "The patient greffier sat at his desk.",
    "The examination began.",
    "\u201cRenauld\u201d began the magistrate \u201cdo you deny that you were in Merlinville on the night of the crime\u201d\n\nJack did not reply at once then he said with a hesitancy of manner which was piteous\n\n\u201cI\u2014I\u2014told you that I was in Cherbourg.\u201d\n\nMa\u00eetre Gros\u00eder frowned and sighed.",
    "I realized at once that Jack Renauld was obstinately bent on conducting his own case as he wished to the despair of his legal representative.",
    "The magistrate turned sharply.",
    "\u201cSend in the station witnesses.\u201d\n\nIn a moment or two the door opened to admit a man whom I recognized as being a porter at Merlinville station.",
    "\u201cYou were on duty on the night of June 7th\u201d\n\n\u201cYes monsieur.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou witnessed the arrival of the 1140 train\u201d\n\n\u201cYes monsieur.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook at the prisoner.",
    "Do you recognize him as having been one of the passengers to alight\u201d\n\n\u201cYes Monsieur le juge.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no possibility of your being mistaken\u201d\n\n\u201cNo monsieur.",
    "I knew M. Jack Renauld well.\u201d\n\n\u201cNor of your being mistaken as to the date\u201d\n\n\u201cNo monsieur.",
    "Because it was the following morning June 8th that we heard of the murder.\u201d\n\nAnother railway official was brought in and confirmed the first one\u2019s evidence.",
    "The magistrate looked at Jack Renauld.",
    "\u201cThese men have identified you positively.",
    "What have you to say\u201d\n\nJack shrugged his shoulders.",
    "\u201cNothing.\u201d\n\nM. Hautet exchanged a glance with the greffier as the scratching of the latter\u2019s pen recorded the answer.",
    "\u201cRenauld\u201d continued the magistrate \u201cdo you recognize this\u201d\n\nHe took something from the table by his side and held it out to the prisoner.",
    "I shuddered as I recognized the aeroplane dagger.",
    "\u201cPardon\u201d cried Ma\u00eetre Gros\u00eder.",
    "\u201cI demand to speak to my client before he answers that question.\u201d\n\nBut Jack Renauld had no consideration for the feelings of the wretched Gros\u00eder.",
    "He waved him aside and replied quietly\n\n\u201cCertainly I recognize it.",
    "It is a present given by me to my mother as a souvenir of the War.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs there as far as you know any duplicate of that dagger in existence\u201d\n\nAgain Ma\u00eetre Gros\u00eder burst out and again Jack overrode him.",
    "\u201cNot that I know of.",
    "The setting was my own design.\u201d\n\nEven the magistrate almost gasped at the boldness of the reply.",
    "It did in very truth seem as though Jack was rushing on his fate.",
    "I realized of course the vital necessity he was under of concealing for Bella\u2019s sake the fact that there was a duplicate dagger in the case.",
    "So long as there was supposed to be only one weapon no suspicion was likely to attach to the girl who had had the second paperknife in her possession.",
    "He was valiantly shielding the woman he had once loved\u2014but at what a cost to himself I began to realize the magnitude of the task I had so lightly set Poirot.",
    "It would not be easy to secure the acquittal of Jack Renauld by anything short of the truth.",
    "M. Hautet spoke again with a peculiarly biting inflection\n\n\u201cMadame Renauld told us that this dagger was on her dressing table on the night of the crime.",
    "But Madame Renauld is a mother It will doubtless astonish you Renauld but I consider it highly likely that Madame Renauld was mistaken and that by inadvertence perhaps you had taken it with you to Paris.",
    "Doubtless you will contradict me\u2014\u201d\n\nI saw the lad\u2019s handcuffed hands clench themselves.",
    "The perspiration stood out in beads upon his brow as with a supreme effort he interrupted M. Hautet in a hoarse voice\n\n\u201cI shall not contradict you.",
    "It is possible.\u201d\n\nIt was a stupefying moment.",
    "Ma\u00eetre Gros\u00eder rose to his feet protesting\n\n\u201cMy client has undergone a considerable nervous strain.",
    "I should wish it put on record that I do not consider him answerable for what he says.\u201d\n\nThe magistrate quelled him angrily.",
    "For a moment a doubt seemed to arise in his own mind.",
    "Jack Renauld had almost overdone his part.",
    "He leaned forward and gazed at the prisoner searchingly.",
    "\u201cDo you fully understand Renauld that on the answers you have given me I shall have no alternative but to commit you for trial\u201d\n\nJack\u2019s pale face flushed.",
    "He looked steadily back.",
    "\u201cM.",
    "Hautet I swear that I did not kill my father.\u201d\n\nBut the magistrate\u2019s brief moment of doubt was over.",
    "He laughed a short unpleasant laugh.",
    "\u201cWithout doubt without doubt\u2014they are always innocent our prisoners By your own mouth you are condemned.",
    "You can offer no defence no alibi\u2014only a mere assertion which would not deceive a babe\u2014that you are not guilty.",
    "You killed your father Renauld\u2014cruel and cowardly murder\u2014for the sake of money which you believed would come to you at his death.",
    "Your mother was an accessory after the fact.",
    "Doubtless in view of the fact that she acted as a mother the courts will extend an indulgence to her that they will not accord to you.",
    "And rightly so Your crime was a horrible one\u2014to be held in abhorrence by gods and men\u201d M. Hautet was enjoying himself working up his period steeped in the solemnity of the moment and his own role as representative of justice.",
    "\u201cYou killed\u2014and you must pay the consequences of your action.",
    "I speak to you not as a man but as Justice eternal Justice which\u2014\u201d\n\nM. Hautet was interrupted\u2014to his intense annoyance.",
    "The door was pushed open.",
    "\u201cM.",
    "le juge M. le juge\u201d stammered the attendant \u201cthere is a lady who says\u2014who says\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWho says what\u201d cried the justly incensed magistrate.",
    "\u201cThis is highly irregular.",
    "I forbid it\u2014I absolutely forbid it.\u201d\n\nBut a slender figure pushed the stammering gendarme aside.",
    "Dressed all in black with a long veil that hid her face she advanced into the room.",
    "My heart gave a sickening throb.",
    "She had come then All my efforts were in vain.",
    "Yet I could not but admire the courage that had led her to take this step so unfalteringly.",
    "She raised her veil\u2014and I gasped.",
    "For though as like her as two peas this girl was not Cinderella On the other hand now that I saw her without the fair wig she had worn on the stage I recognized her as the girl of the photograph in Jack Renauld\u2019s room.",
    "\u201cYou are the Juge d\u2019Instruction M. Hautet\u201d she queried.",
    "\u201cYes but I forbid\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cMy name is Bella Duveen.",
    "I wish to give myself up for the murder of Mr. Renauld.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n26\n\nI Receive a Letter\n\n\n\u201cMy Friend\n\n\u201cYou will know all when you get this.",
    "Nothing that I can say will move Bella.",
    "She has gone out to give herself up.",
    "I am tired out with struggling.",
    "\u201cYou will know now that I deceived you that where you gave me trust I repaid you with lies.",
    "It will seem perhaps indefensible to you but I should like before I go out of your life for ever to show you just how it all came about.",
    "If I knew that you forgave me it would make life easier for me.",
    "It wasn\u2019t for myself I did it\u2014that\u2019s the only thing I can put forward to say for myself.",
    "\u201cI\u2019ll begin from the day I met you in the boat train from Paris.",
    "I was uneasy then about Bella.",
    "She was just desperate about Jack Renauld she\u2019d have lain down on the ground for him to walk on and when he began to change and to stop writing so often she began getting in a state.",
    "She got it into her head that he was keen on another girl\u2014and of course as it turned out afterwards she was quite right there.",
    "She\u2019d made up her mind to go to their Villa at Merlinville and try and see Jack.",
    "She knew I was against it and tried to give me the slip.",
    "I found she was not on the train at Calais and determined I would not go on to England without her.",
    "I\u2019d an uneasy feeling that something awful was going to happen if I couldn\u2019t prevent it.",
    "\u201cI met the next train from Paris.",
    "She was on it and set upon going out then and there to Merlinville.",
    "I argued with her for all I was worth but it wasn\u2019t any good.",
    "She was all strung up and set upon having her own way.",
    "Well I washed my hands of it.",
    "I\u2019d done all I could It was getting late.",
    "I went to an hotel and Bella started for Merlinville.",
    "I still couldn\u2019t shake off my feeling of what the books call \u2018impending disaster.\u2019\n\n\u201cThe next day came\u2014but no Bella.",
    "She\u2019d made a date with me to meet at the hotel but she didn\u2019t keep it.",
    "No sign of her all day.",
    "I got more and more anxious.",
    "Then came an evening paper with the news.",
    "\u201cIt was awful I couldn\u2019t be sure of course\u2014but I was terribly afraid.",
    "I figured it out that Bella had met Papa Renauld and told him about her and Jack and that he\u2019d insulted her or something like that.",
    "We\u2019ve both got terribly quick tempers.",
    "\u201cThen all the masked foreigner business came out and I began to feel more at ease.",
    "But it still worried me that Bella hadn\u2019t kept her date with me.",
    "\u201cBy the next morning I was so rattled that I\u2019d just got to go and see what I could.",
    "First thing I ran up against you.",
    "You know all that\u200a\u2026 When I saw the dead man looking so like Jack and wearing Jack\u2019s fancy overcoat I knew And there was the identical paperknife\u2014wicked little thing\u2014that Jack had given Bella Ten to one it had her fingermarks on it.",
    "I can\u2019t hope to explain to you the sort of helpless horror of that moment.",
    "I only saw one thing clearly\u2014I must get hold of that dagger and get right away with it before they found out it was gone.",
    "I pretended to faint and whilst you were away getting water I took the thing and hid it away in my dress.",
    "\u201cI told you that I was staying at the H\u00f4tel du Phare but of course really I made a bee line back to Calais and then on to England by the first boat.",
    "When we were in midChannel I dropped that little devil of a dagger into the sea.",
    "Then I felt I could breathe again.",
    "\u201cBella was at our digs in London.",
    "She looked like nothing on God\u2019s earth.",
    "I told her what I\u2019d done and that she was pretty safe for the time being.",
    "She stared at me and then began laughing\u200a\u2026 laughing\u200a\u2026 laughing\u200a\u2026 it was horrible to hear her I felt that the best thing to do was to keep busy.",
    "She\u2019d go mad if she had time to brood on what she\u2019d done.",
    "Luckily we got an engagement at once.",
    "\u201cAnd then I saw you and your friend watching us that night\u200a\u2026 I was frantic.",
    "You must suspect or you wouldn\u2019t have tracked us down.",
    "I had to know the worst so I followed you.",
    "I was desperate.",
    "And then before I\u2019d had time to say anything I tumbled to it that it was me you suspected not Bella Or at least that you thought I was Bella since I\u2019d stolen the dagger.",
    "\u201cI wish honey that you could see back into my mind at that moment\u200a\u2026 you\u2019d forgive me perhaps\u200a\u2026 I was so frightened and muddled and desperate.",
    "\u2026 All I could get clearly was that you would try and save me.",
    "I didn\u2019t know whether you\u2019d be willing to save her\u200a\u2026 I thought very likely not\u2014it wasn\u2019t the same thing And I couldn\u2019t risk it Bella\u2019s my twin\u2014I\u2019d got to do the best for her.",
    "So I went on lying.",
    "\u2026 I felt mean\u2014I feel mean still.",
    "\u2026 That\u2019s all\u2014enough too you\u2019ll say I expect.",
    "I ought to have trusted you.",
    "\u2026 If I had\u2014\n\n\u201cAs soon as the news was in the paper that Jack Renauld had been arrested it was all up.",
    "Bella wouldn\u2019t even wait to see how things went.",
    "\u2026\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very tired.",
    "\u2026 I can\u2019t write any more.",
    "\u2026\u201d\n\nShe had begun to sign herself Cinderella but had crossed that out and written instead \u201cDulcie Duveen.\u201d\n\nIt was an illwritten blurred epistle but I have kept it to this day.",
    "Poirot was with me when I read it.",
    "The sheets fell from my hand and I looked across at him.",
    "\u201cDid you know all the time that it was\u2014the other\u201d\n\n\u201cYes my friend.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy did you not tell me\u201d\n\n\u201cTo begin with I could hardly believe it conceivable that you could make such a mistake.",
    "You had seen the photograph.",
    "The sisters are very alike but by no means incapable of distinguishment.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut the fair hair\u201d\n\n\u201cA wig worn for the sake of a piquant contrast on the stage.",
    "Is it conceivable that with twins one should be fair and one dark\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me that night at the hotel in Coventry\u201d\n\n\u201cYou were rather highhanded in your methods mon ami\u201d said Poirot dryly.",
    "\u201cYou did not give me a chance.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut afterwards\u201d\n\n\u201cAh afterwards Well to begin with I was hurt at your want of faith in me.",
    "And then I wanted to see whether your\u2014feelings would stand the test of time.",
    "In fact whether it was love or a flash in the pan with you.",
    "I should not have left you long in your error.\u201d\n\nI nodded.",
    "His tone was too affectionate for me to bear resentment.",
    "I looked down on the sheets of the letter.",
    "Suddenly I picked them up from the floor and pushed them across to him.",
    "\u201cRead that\u201d I said.",
    "\u201cI\u2019d like you to.\u201d\n\nHe read it through in silence then he looked up at me.",
    "\u201cWhat is it that worries you Hastings\u201d\n\nThis was quite a new mood in Poirot.",
    "His mocking manner seemed laid quite aside.",
    "I was able to say what I wanted without too much difficulty.",
    "\u201cShe doesn\u2019t say\u2014she doesn\u2019t say\u2014well not whether she cares for me or not\u201d\n\nPoirot turned back the pages.",
    "\u201cI think you are mistaken Hastings.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere\u201d I cried leaning forward eagerly.",
    "Poirot smiled.",
    "\u201cShe tells you that in every line of the letter mon ami.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut where am I to find her There\u2019s no address on the letter.",
    "There\u2019s a French stamp that\u2019s all.\u201d\n\n\u201cExcite yourself not Leave it to Papa Poirot.",
    "I can find her for you as soon as I have five little minutes\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n27\n\nJack Renauld\u2019s Story\n\n\n\u201cCongratulations M. Jack\u201d said Poirot wringing the lad warmly by the hand.",
    "Young Renauld had come to us as soon as he was liberated\u2014before starting for Merlinville to rejoin Marthe and his mother.",
    "Stonor accompanied him.",
    "His heartiness was in strong contrast to the lad\u2019s wan looks.",
    "It was plain that the boy was on the verge of a nervous breakdown.",
    "Although delivered from the immediate peril that was hanging over him the circumstances of his release were too painful to let him feel full relief.",
    "He smiled mournfully at Poirot and said in a low voice\n\n\u201cI went through it to protect her and now it\u2019s all no use\u201d\n\n\u201cYou could hardly expect the girl to accept the price of your life\u201d remarked Stonor dryly.",
    "\u201cShe was bound to come forward when she saw you heading straight for the guillotine.\u201d\n\n\u201cEh ma foi and you were heading for it too\u201d added Poirot with a slight twinkle.",
    "\u201cYou would have had Ma\u00eetre Gros\u00eder\u2019s death from rage on your conscience if you had gone on.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was a well meaning ass I suppose\u201d said Jack.",
    "\u201cBut he worried me horribly.",
    "You see I couldn\u2019t very well take him into my confidence.",
    "But my God what\u2019s going to happen about Bella\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I were you\u201d said Poirot frankly \u201cI should not distress myself unduly.",
    "The French Courts are very lenient to youth and beauty and the crime passionnel.",
    "A clever lawyer will make out a great case of extenuating circumstances.",
    "It will not be pleasant for you\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care about that.",
    "You see M. Poirot in a way I do feel guilty of my father\u2019s murder.",
    "But for me and my entanglement with this girl he would be alive and well today.",
    "And then my cursed carelessness in taking away the wrong overcoat.",
    "I can\u2019t help feeling responsible for his death.",
    "It will haunt me for ever\u201d\n\n\u201cNo no\u201d I said soothingly.",
    "\u201cOf course it\u2019s horrible to me to think that Bella killed my father\u201d resumed Jack \u201cbut I\u2019d treated her shamefully.",
    "After I met Marthe and realized I\u2019d made a mistake I ought to have written and told her so honestly.",
    "But I was so terrified of a row and of its coming to Marthe\u2019s ears and her thinking there was more in it than there ever had been that\u2014well I was a coward and went on hoping the thing would die down of itself.",
    "I just drifted in fact\u2014not realizing that I was driving the poor kid desperate.",
    "If she\u2019d really knifed me as she meant to I should have got no more than my deserts.",
    "And the way she\u2019s come forward now is downright plucky.",
    "I\u2019d have stood the racket you know\u2014up to the end.\u201d\n\nHe was silent for a moment or two and then burst out on another tack\n\n\u201cWhat gets me is why the Governor should be wandering about in underclothes and my overcoat at that time of night.",
    "I suppose he\u2019d just given the foreign johnnies the slip and my mother must have made a mistake about its being 2 o\u2019clock when they came.",
    "Or\u2014or it wasn\u2019t all a frame up was it I mean my mother didn\u2019t think\u2014couldn\u2019t think\u2014that\u2014that it was me\u201d\n\nPoirot reassured him quickly.",
    "\u201cNo no M. Jack.",
    "Have no fears on that score.",
    "As for the rest I will explain it to you one of these days.",
    "It is rather curious.",
    "But will you recount to us exactly what did occur on that terrible evening\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s very little to tell.",
    "I came from Cherbourg as I told you in order to see Marthe before going to the other end of the world.",
    "The train was late and I decided to take the short cut across the golf links.",
    "I could easily get into the grounds of the Villa Marguerite from there.",
    "I had nearly reached the place when\u2014\u201d\n\nHe paused and swallowed.",
    "\u201cYes\u201d\n\n\u201cI heard a terrible cry.",
    "It wasn\u2019t loud\u2014a sort of choke and gasp\u2014but it frightened me.",
    "For a moment I stood rooted to the spot.",
    "Then I came round the corner of a bush.",
    "There was moonlight.",
    "I saw the grave and a figure lying face downwards with a dagger sticking in the back.",
    "And then\u2014and then\u2014I looked up and saw her.",
    "She was looking at me as though she saw a ghost\u2014it\u2019s what she must have thought me at first\u2014all expression seemed frozen out of her face by horror.",
    "And then she gave a cry and turned and ran.\u201d\n\nHe stopped trying to master his emotion.",
    "\u201cAnd afterwards\u201d asked Poirot gently.",
    "\u201cI really don\u2019t know.",
    "I stayed there for a time dazed.",
    "And then I realized I\u2019d better get away as fast as I could.",
    "It didn\u2019t occur to me that they would suspect me but I was afraid of being called upon to give evidence against her.",
    "I walked to St. Beauvais as I told you and got a car from there back to Cherbourg.\u201d\n\nA knock came at the door and a page entered with a telegram which he delivered to Stonor.",
    "He tore it open.",
    "Then he got up from his seat.",
    "\u201cMrs.",
    "Renauld has regained consciousness\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cAh\u201d Poirot sprang to his feet.",
    "\u201cLet us all go to Merlinville at once\u201d\n\nA hurried departure was made forthwith.",
    "Stonor at Jack\u2019s instance agreed to stay behind and do all that could be done for Bella Duveen.",
    "Poirot Jack Renauld and I set off in the Renauld car.",
    "The run took just over forty minutes.",
    "As we approached the doorway of the Villa Marguerite Jack Renauld shot a questioning glance at Poirot.",
    "\u201cHow would it be if you went on first\u2014to break the news to my mother that I am free\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile you break it in person to Mademoiselle Marthe eh\u201d finished Poirot with a twinkle.",
    "\u201cBut yes by all means I was about to propose such an arrangement myself.\u201d\n\nJack Renauld did not wait for more.",
    "Stopping the car he swung himself out and ran up the path to the front door.",
    "We went on in the car to the Villa Genevi\u00e8ve.",
    "\u201cPoirot\u201d I said \u201cdo you remember how we arrived here that first day And were met by the news of M. Renauld\u2019s murder\u201d\n\n\u201cAh yes truly.",
    "Not so long ago either.",
    "But what a lot of things have happened since then\u2014especially for you mon ami\u201d\n\n\u201cPoirot what have you done about finding Bel\u2014I mean Dulcie\u201d\n\n\u201cCalm yourself Hastings.",
    "I arrange everything.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re being a precious long time about it\u201d I grumbled.",
    "Poirot changed the subject.",
    "\u201cThen the beginning now the end\u201d he moralized as we rang the bell.",
    "\u201cAnd considered as a case the end is profoundly unsatisfactory.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes indeed\u201d I sighed.",
    "\u201cYou are regarding it from the sentimental standpoint Hastings.",
    "That was not my meaning.",
    "We will hope that Mademoiselle Bella will be dealt with leniently and after all Jack Renauld cannot marry both the girls.",
    "I spoke from a professional standpoint.",
    "This is not a crime well ordered and regular such as a detective delights in.",
    "The mise en sc\u00e8ne designed by Georges Conneau that indeed is perfect but the d\u00e9nouement\u2014ah no A man killed by accident in a girl\u2019s fit of anger\u2014ah indeed what order or method is there in that\u201d\n\nAnd in the midst of a fit of laughter on my part at Poirot\u2019s peculiarities the door was opened by Fran\u00e7oise.",
    "Poirot explained that he must see Mrs. Renauld at once and the old woman conducted him upstairs.",
    "I remained in the salon.",
    "It was some time before Poirot reappeared.",
    "He was looking unusually grave.",
    "\u201cVous voil\u00e0 Hastings Sacr\u00e9 tonnerre but there are squalls ahead\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean\u201d I cried.",
    "\u201cI would hardly have credited it\u201d said Poirot thoughtfully \u201cbut women are very unexpected.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere are Jack and Marthe Daubreuil\u201d I exclaimed looking out of the window.",
    "Poirot bounded out of the room and met the young couple on the steps outside.",
    "\u201cDo not enter.",
    "It is better not.",
    "Your mother is very upset.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know I know\u201d said Jack Renauld.",
    "\u201cI must go up to her at once.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut no I tell you.",
    "It is better not.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut Marthe and I\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIn any case do not take Mademoiselle with you.",
    "Mount if you must but you would be wise to be guided by me.\u201d\n\nA voice on the stairs behind made us all start.",
    "\u201cI thank you for your good offices M. Poirot but I will make my own wishes clear.\u201d\n\nWe stared in astonishment.",
    "Descending the stairs leaning upon L\u00e9onie\u2019s arm was Mrs. Renauld her head still bandaged.",
    "The French girl was weeping and imploring her mistress to return to bed.",
    "\u201cMadame will kill herself.",
    "It is contrary to all the doctor\u2019s orders\u201d\n\nBut Mrs. Renauld came on.",
    "\u201cMother\u201d cried Jack starting forward.",
    "But with a gesture she drove him back.",
    "\u201cI am no mother of yours You are no son of mine From this day and hour I renounce you.\u201d\n\n\u201cMother\u201d cried the lad stupefied.",
    "For a moment she seemed to waver to falter before the anguish in his voice.",
    "Poirot made a mediating gesture but instantly she regained command of herself.",
    "\u201cYour father\u2019s blood is on your head.",
    "You are morally guilty of his death.",
    "You thwarted and defied him over this girl and by your heartless treatment of another girl you brought about his death.",
    "Go out from my house.",
    "Tomorrow I intend to take such steps as shall make it certain that you shall never touch a penny of his money.",
    "Make your way in the world as best you can with the help of the girl who is the daughter of your father\u2019s bitterest enemy\u201d\n\nAnd slowly painfully she retraced her way upstairs.",
    "We were all dumbfounded\u2014totally unprepared for such a demonstration.",
    "Jack Renauld worn out with all he had already gone through swayed and nearly fell.",
    "Poirot and I went quickly to his assistance.",
    "\u201cHe is overdone\u201d murmured Poirot to Marthe.",
    "\u201cWhere can we take him\u201d\n\n\u201cBut home To the Villa Marguerite.",
    "We will nurse him my mother and I.",
    "My poor Jack\u201d\n\nWe got the lad to the Villa where he dropped limply on to a chair in a semidazed condition.",
    "Poirot felt his head and hands.",
    "\u201cHe has fever.",
    "The long strain begins to tell.",
    "And now this shock on top of it.",
    "Get him to bed and Hastings and I will summon a doctor.\u201d\n\nA doctor was soon procured.",
    "After examining the patient he gave it as his opinion that it was simply a case of nerve strain.",
    "With perfect rest and quiet the lad might be almost restored by the next day but if excited there was a chance of brain fever.",
    "It would be advisable for some one to sit up all night with him.",
    "Finally having done all we could we left him in the charge of Marthe and her mother and set out for the town.",
    "It was past our usual hour of dining and we were both famished.",
    "The first restaurant we came to assuaged the pangs of hunger with an excellent omelette and an equally excellent entrec\u00f4te to follow.",
    "\u201cAnd now for quarters for the night\u201d said Poirot when at length caf\u00e9 noir had completed the meal.",
    "\u201cShall we try our old friend the H\u00f4tel des Bains\u201d\n\nWe traced our steps there without more ado.",
    "Yes Messieurs could be accommodated with two good rooms overlooking the sea.",
    "Then Poirot asked a question which surprised me.",
    "\u201cHas an English lady Miss Robinson arrived\u201d\n\n\u201cYes monsieur.",
    "She is in the little salon.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh\u201d\n\n\u201cPoirot\u201d I cried keeping pace with him as he walked along the corridor \u201cwho on earth is Miss Robinson\u201d\n\nPoirot beamed kindly on me.",
    "\u201cIt is that I have arranged you a marriage Hastings.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I say\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cBah\u201d said Poirot giving me a friendly push over the threshold of the door.",
    "\u201cDo you think I wish to trumpet aloud in Merlinville the name of Duveen\u201d\n\nIt was indeed Cinderella who rose to greet us.",
    "I took her hands in both of mine.",
    "My eyes said the rest.",
    "Poirot cleared his throat.",
    "\u201cMes enfants\u201d he said \u201cfor the moment we have no time for sentiment.",
    "There is work ahead of us.",
    "Mademoiselle were you able to do what I asked you\u201d\n\nIn response Cinderella took from her bag an object wrapped up in paper and handed it silently to Poirot.",
    "The latter unwrapped it.",
    "I gave a start\u2014for it was the aeroplane dagger which I understood she had cast into the sea.",
    "Strange how reluctant women always are to destroy the most compromising of objects and documents\n\n\u201cTr\u00e8s bien mon enfant\u201d said Poirot.",
    "\u201cI am pleased with you.",
    "Go now and rest yourself.",
    "Hastings here and I have work to do.",
    "You shall see him tomorrow.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere are you going\u201d asked the girl her eyes widening.",
    "\u201cYou shall hear all about it tomorrow.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause wherever you\u2019re going I\u2019m coming too.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut mademoiselle\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m coming too I tell you.\u201d\n\nPoirot realized that it was futile to argue further.",
    "He gave in.",
    "\u201cCome then mademoiselle.",
    "But it will not be amusing.",
    "In all probability nothing will happen.\u201d\n\nThe girl made no reply.",
    "Twenty minutes later we set forth.",
    "It was quite dark now a close oppressive evening.",
    "Poirot led the way out of the town in the direction of the Villa Genevi\u00e8ve.",
    "But when he reached the Villa Marguerite he paused.",
    "\u201cI should like to assure myself that all goes well with Jack Renauld.",
    "Come with me Hastings.",
    "Mademoiselle will perhaps remain outside.",
    "Madame Daubreuil might say something which would wound her.\u201d\n\nWe unlatched the gate and walked up the path.",
    "As we went round to the side of the house I drew Poirot\u2019s attention to a window on the first floor.",
    "Thrown sharply on the blind was the profile of Marthe Daubreuil.",
    "\u201cAh\u201d said Poirot.",
    "\u201cI figure to myself that that is the room where we shall find Jack Renauld.\u201d\n\nMadame Daubreuil opened the door to us.",
    "She explained that Jack was much the same but perhaps we would like to see for ourselves.",
    "She led us upstairs and into the bedroom.",
    "Marthe Daubreuil was embroidering by a table with a lamp on it.",
    "She put her finger to her lips as we entered.",
    "Jack Renauld was sleeping an uneasy fitful sleep his head turning from side to side and his face still unduly flushed.",
    "\u201cIs the doctor coming again\u201d asked Poirot in a whisper.",
    "\u201cNot unless we send.",
    "He is sleeping\u2014that is the great thing.",
    "Maman made him a tisane.\u201d\n\nShe sat down again with her embroidery as we left the room.",
    "Madame Daubreuil accompanied us down the stairs.",
    "Since I had learned of her past history I viewed this woman with increased interest.",
    "She stood there with her eyes cast down the same very faint enigmatical smile that I remembered on her lips.",
    "And suddenly I felt afraid of her as one might feel afraid of a beautiful poisonous snake.",
    "\u201cI hope we have not deranged you madame\u201d said Poirot politely as she opened the door for us to pass out.",
    "\u201cNot at all monsieur.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy the way\u201d said Poirot as though struck by an afterthought \u201cM.",
    "Stonor has not been in Merlinville today has he\u201d\n\nI could not at all fathom the point of this question which I well knew to be meaningless as far as Poirot was concerned.",
    "Madame Daubreuil replied quite composedly\n\n\u201cNot that I know of.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe has not had an interview with Mrs. Renauld\u201d\n\n\u201cHow should I know that monsieur\u201d\n\n\u201cTrue\u201d said Poirot.",
    "\u201cI thought you might have seen him coming or going that is all.",
    "Good night madame.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy\u2014\u201d I began.",
    "\u201cNo \u2018whys\u2019 Hastings.",
    "There will be time for that later.\u201d\n\nWe rejoined Cinderella and made our way rapidly in the direction of the Villa Genevi\u00e8ve.",
    "Poirot looked over his shoulder once at the lighted window and the profile of Marthe as she bent over her work.",
    "\u201cHe is being guarded at all events\u201d he muttered.",
    "Arrived at the Villa Genevi\u00e8ve Poirot took up his stand behind some bushes to the left of the drive where whilst enjoying a good view ourselves we were completely hidden from sight.",
    "The Villa itself was in total darkness everybody was without doubt in bed and asleep.",
    "We were almost immediately under the window of Mrs. Renauld\u2019s bedroom which window I noticed was open.",
    "It seemed to me that it was upon this spot that Poirot\u2019s eyes were fixed.",
    "\u201cWhat are we going to do\u201d I whispered.",
    "\u201cWatch.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI do not expect anything to happen for at least an hour probably two hours but the\u2014\u201d\n\nBut his words were interrupted by a long thin drawn cry\n\n\u201cHelp\u201d\n\nA light flashed up in the second floor room on the right hand side of the house.",
    "The cry came from there.",
    "And even as we watched there came a shadow on the blind as of two people struggling.",
    "\u201cMille tonnerres\u201d cried Poirot.",
    "\u201cShe must have changed her room\u201d\n\nDashing forward he battered wildly on the front door.",
    "Then rushing to the tree in the flowerbed he swarmed up it with the agility of a cat.",
    "I followed him as with a bound he sprang in through the open window.",
    "Looking over my shoulder I saw Dulcie reaching the branch behind me.",
    "\u201cTake care\u201d I exclaimed.",
    "\u201cTake care of your grandmother\u201d retorted the girl.",
    "\u201cThis is child\u2019s play to me.\u201d\n\nPoirot had rushed through the empty room and was pounding on the door leading into the corridor.",
    "\u201cLocked and bolted on the outside\u201d he growled.",
    "\u201cAnd it will take time to burst it open.\u201d\n\nThe cries for help were getting noticeably fainter.",
    "I saw despair in Poirot\u2019s eyes.",
    "He and I together put our shoulders to the door.",
    "Cinderella\u2019s voice calm and dispassionate came from the window\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be too late I guess I\u2019m the only one who can do anything.\u201d\n\nBefore I could move a hand to stop her she appeared to leap upward into space.",
    "I rushed and looked out.",
    "To my horror I saw her hanging by her hands from the roof propelling herself along by jerks in the direction of the lighted window.",
    "\u201cGood heavens She\u2019ll be killed\u201d I cried.",
    "\u201cYou forget.",
    "She\u2019s a professional acrobat Hastings.",
    "It was the providence of the good God that made her insist on coming with us tonight.",
    "I only pray that she may be in time.",
    "Ah\u201d\n\nA cry of absolute terror floated out on to the night as the girl disappeared through the righthand window then in Cinderella\u2019s clear tones came the words\n\n\u201cNo you don\u2019t I\u2019ve got you\u2014and my wrists are just like steel.\u201d\n\nAt the same moment the door of our prison was opened cautiously by Fran\u00e7oise.",
    "Poirot brushed her aside unceremoniously and rushed down the passage to where the other maids were grouped round the further door.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s locked on the inside monsieur.\u201d\n\nThere was the sound of a heavy fall within.",
    "After a moment or two the key turned and the door swung slowly open.",
    "Cinderella very pale beckoned us in.",
    "\u201cShe is safe\u201d demanded Poirot.",
    "\u201cYes I was just in time.",
    "She was exhausted.\u201d\n\nMrs. Renauld was half sitting half lying on the bed.",
    "She was gasping for breath.",
    "\u201cNearly strangled me\u201d she murmured painfully.",
    "The girl picked up something from the floor and handed it to Poirot.",
    "It was a rolled up ladder of silk rope very fine but quite strong.",
    "\u201cA getaway\u201d said Poirot.",
    "\u201cBy the window whilst we were battering at the door.",
    "Where is\u2014the other\u201d\n\nThe girl stood aside a little and pointed.",
    "On the ground lay a figure wrapped in some dark material a fold of which hid the face.",
    "\u201cDead\u201d\n\nShe nodded.",
    "\u201cI think so.\u201d\n\n\u201cHead must have struck the marble fender.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut who is it\u201d I cried.",
    "\u201cThe murderer of M. Renauld Hastings.",
    "And the wouldbe murderer of Madame Renauld.\u201d\n\nPuzzled and uncomprehending I knelt down and lifting the fold of cloth looked into the dead beautiful face of Marthe Daubreuil\n\n\n\n\n\n28\n\nJourney\u2019s End\n\n\nI have confused memories of the further events of that night.",
    "Poirot seemed deaf to my repeated questions.",
    "He was engaged in overwhelming Fran\u00e7oise with reproaches for not having told him of Mrs. Renauld\u2019s change of sleeping quarters.",
    "I caught him by the shoulder determined to attract his attention and make myself heard.",
    "\u201cBut you must have known\u201d I expostulated.",
    "\u201cYou were taken up to see her this afternoon.\u201d\n\nPoirot deigned to attend to me for a brief moment.",
    "\u201cShe had been wheeled on a sofa into the middle room\u2014her boudoir\u201d he explained.",
    "\u201cBut monsieur\u201d cried Fran\u00e7oise \u201cMadame changed her room almost immediately after the crime The associations\u2014they were too distressing\u201d\n\n\u201cThen why was I not told\u201d vociferated Poirot striking the table and working himself into a firstclass passion.",
    "\u201cI demand you\u2014why\u2014was\u2014I\u2014not\u2014told You are an old woman completely imbecile And L\u00e9onie and Denise are no better.",
    "All of you are triple idiots Your stupidity has nearly caused the death of your mistress.",
    "But for this courageous child\u2014\u201d\n\nHe broke off and darting across the room to where the girl was bending over ministering to Mrs. Renauld he embraced her with Gallic fervour\u2014slightly to my annoyance.",
    "I was aroused from my condition of mental fog by a sharp command from Poirot to fetch the doctor immediately on Mrs. Renauld\u2019s behalf.",
    "After that I might summon the police.",
    "And he added to complete my dudgeon\n\n\u201cIt will hardly be worth your while to return here.",
    "I shall be too busy to attend to you and of Mademoiselle here I make a gardemalad.\u201d\n\nI retired with what dignity I could command.",
    "Having done my errands I returned to the hotel.",
    "I understood next to nothing of what had occurred.",
    "The events of the night seemed fantastic and impossible.",
    "Nobody would answer my questions.",
    "Nobody had seemed to hear them.",
    "Angrily I flung myself into bed and slept the sleep of the bewildered and utterly exhausted.",
    "I awoke to find the sun pouring in through the open windows and Poirot neat and smiling sitting beside the bed.",
    "\u201cEnfin you wake But it is that you are a famous sleeper Hastings Do you know that it is nearly eleven o\u2019clock\u201d\n\nI groaned and put a hand to my head.",
    "\u201cI must have been dreaming\u201d I said.",
    "\u201cDo you know I actually dreamt that we found Marthe Daubreuil\u2019s body in Mrs. Renauld\u2019s room and that you declared her to have murdered Mr. Renauld\u201d\n\n\u201cYou were not dreaming.",
    "All that is quite true.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut Bella Duveen killed Mr. Renauld\u201d\n\n\u201cOh no Hastings she did not She said she did\u2014yes\u2014but that was to save the man she loved from the guillotine.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u201d\n\n\u201cRemember Jack Renauld\u2019s story.",
    "They both arrived on the scene at the same instant and each took the other to be the perpetrator of the crime.",
    "The girl stares at him in horror and then with a cry rushes away.",
    "But when she hears that the crime has been brought home to him she cannot bear it and comes forward to accuse herself and save him from certain death.\u201d\n\nPoirot leaned back in his chair and brought the tips of his fingers together in familiar style.",
    "\u201cThe case was not quite satisfactory to me\u201d he observed judicially.",
    "\u201cAll along I was strongly under the impression that we were dealing with a coldblooded and premeditated crime committed by some one who had been contented very cleverly with using M. Renauld\u2019s own plans for throwing the police off the track.",
    "The great criminal as you may remember my remarking to you once is always supremely simple.\u201d\n\nI nodded.",
    "\u201cNow to support this theory the criminal must have been fully cognizant of Mr. Renauld\u2019s plans.",
    "That leads us to Madame Renauld.",
    "But facts fail to support any theory of her guilt.",
    "Is there any one else who might have known of them Yes.",
    "From Marthe Daubreuil\u2019s own lips we have the admission that she overheard M. Renauld\u2019s quarrel with the tramp.",
    "If she could overhear that there is no reason why she should not have heard everything else especially if M. and Madame Renauld were imprudent enough to discuss their plans sitting on the bench.",
    "Remember how easily you overheard Marthe\u2019s conversation with Jack Renauld from that spot.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut what possible motive could Marthe have for murdering Mr. Renauld\u201d I argued.",
    "\u201cWhat motive Money M. Renauld was a millionaire several times over and at his death or so she and Jack believed half that vast fortune would pass to his son.",
    "Let us reconstruct the scene from the standpoint of Marthe Daubreuil.",
    "\u201cMarthe Daubreuil overhears what passes between Renauld and his wife.",
    "So far he has been a nice little source of income to the Daubreuil mother and daughter but now he proposes to escape from their toils.",
    "At first possibly her idea is to prevent that escape.",
    "But a bolder idea takes its place and one that fails to horrify the daughter of Jeanne Beroldy At present M. Renauld stands inexorably in the way of her marriage with Jack.",
    "If the latter defies his father he will be a pauper\u2014which is not at all to the mind of Mademoiselle Marthe.",
    "In fact I doubt if she has ever cared a straw for Jack Renauld.",
    "She can simulate emotion but in reality she is of the same cold calculating type as her mother.",
    "I doubt too whether she was really very sure of her hold over the boy\u2019s affections.",
    "She had dazzled and captivated him but separated from her as his father could so easily manage to separate him she might lose him.",
    "But with M. Renauld dead and Jack the heir to half his millions the marriage can take place at once and at a stroke she will attain wealth\u2014not the beggarly thousands that have been extracted from him so far.",
    "And her clever brain takes in the simplicity of the thing.",
    "It is all so easy.",
    "M. Renauld is planning all the circumstances of his death\u2014she has only to step in at the right moment and turn the farce into a grim reality.",
    "And here comes in the second point which led me infallibly to Marthe Daubreuil\u2014the dagger Jack Renauld had three souvenirs made.",
    "One he gave to his mother one to Bella Duveen was it not highly probable that he had given the third one to Marthe Daubreuil\n\n\u201cSo then to sum up there were four points of note against Marthe Daubreuil\n\n\u201c1 Marthe Daubreuil could have overheard M. Renauld\u2019s plans.",
    "\u201c2 Marthe Daubreuil had a direct interest in causing M. Renauld\u2019s death.",
    "\u201c3 Marthe Daubreuil was the daughter of the notorious Madame Beroldy who in my opinion was morally and virtually the murderess of her husband although it may have been Georges Conneau\u2019s hand which struck the actual blow.",
    "\u201c4 Marthe Daubreuil was the only person besides Jack Renauld likely to have the third dagger in her possession.\u201d\n\nPoirot paused and cleared his throat.",
    "\u201cOf course when I learned of the existence of the other girl Bella Duveen I realized that it was quite possible that she might have killed M. Renauld.",
    "The solution did not commend itself to me because as I pointed out to you Hastings an expert such as I am likes to meet a foeman worthy of his steel.",
    "Still one must take crimes as one finds them not as one would like them to be.",
    "It did not seem very likely that Bella Duveen would be wandering about carrying a souvenir paperknife in her hand but of course she might have had some idea all the time of revenging herself on Jack Renauld.",
    "When she actually came forward and confessed to the murder it seemed that all was over.",
    "And yet\u2014I was not satisfied mon ami.",
    "I was not satisfied.",
    "\u2026\n\n\u201cI went over the case again minutely and I came to the same conclusion as before.",
    "If it was not Bella Duveen the only other person who could have committed the crime was Marthe Daubreuil.",
    "But I had not one single proof against her\n\n\u201cAnd then you showed me that letter from Mademoiselle Dulcie and I saw a chance of settling the matter once for all.",
    "The original dagger was stolen by Dulcie Duveen and thrown into the sea\u2014since as she thought it belonged to her sister.",
    "But if by any chance it was not her sister\u2019s but the one given by Jack to Marthe Daubreuil\u2014why then Bella Duveen\u2019s dagger would be still intact I said no word to you Hastings it was no time for romance but I sought out Mademoiselle Dulcie told her as much as I deemed needful and set her to search amongst the effects of her sister.",
    "Imagine my elation when she sought me out according to my instructions as Miss Robinson with the precious souvenir in her possession\n\n\u201cIn the meantime I had taken steps to force Mademoiselle Marthe into the open.",
    "By my orders Mrs. Renauld repulsed her son and declared her intention of making a will on the morrow which should cut him off from ever enjoying even a portion of his father\u2019s fortune.",
    "It was a desperate step but a necessary one and Madame Renauld was fully prepared to take the risk\u2014though unfortunately she also never thought of mentioning her change of room.",
    "I suppose she took it for granted that I knew.",
    "All happened as I thought.",
    "Marthe Daubreuil made a last bold bid for the Renauld millions\u2014and failed\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat absolutely bewilders me\u201d I said \u201cis how she ever got into the house without our seeing her.",
    "It seems an absolute miracle.",
    "We left her behind at the Villa Marguerite we go straight to the Villa Genevi\u00e8ve\u2014and yet she is there before us\u201d\n\n\u201cAh but we did not leave her behind.",
    "She was out of the Villa Marguerite by the back way whilst we were talking to her mother in the hall.",
    "That is where as the Americans say she \u2018put it over\u2019 on Hercule Poirot\u201d\n\n\u201cBut the shadow on the blind We saw it from the road.\u201d\n\n\u201cEh bien when we looked up Madame Daubreuil had just had time to run upstairs and take her place.\u201d\n\n\u201cMadame Daubreuil\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.",
    "One is old and one is young one dark and one fair but for the purpose of a silhouette on a blind their profiles are singularly alike.",
    "Even I did not suspect\u2014triple imbecile that I was I thought I had plenty of time before me\u2014that she would not try to gain admission to the Villa until much later.",
    "She had brains that beautiful Mademoiselle Marthe.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd her object was to murder Mrs. Renauld\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.",
    "The whole fortune would then pass to her son.",
    "But it would have been suicide mon ami On the floor by Marthe Daubreuil\u2019s body I found a pad and a little bottle of chloroform and a hypodermic syringe containing a fatal dose of morphine.",
    "You understand The chloroform first\u2014then when the victim is unconscious the prick of the needle.",
    "By the morning the smell of the chloroform has quite disappeared and the syringe lies where it has fallen from Madame Renauld\u2019s hand.",
    "What would he say the excellent M. Hautet \u2018Poor woman What did I tell you The shock of joy it was too much on top of the rest Did I not say that I should not be surprised if her brain became unhinged.",
    "Altogether a most tragic case the Renauld Case\u2019\n\n\u201cHowever Hastings things did not go quite as Mademoiselle Marthe had planned.",
    "To begin with Madame Renauld was awake and waiting for her.",
    "There is a struggle.",
    "But Madame Renauld is terribly weak still.",
    "There is a last chance for Marthe Daubreuil.",
    "The idea of suicide is at an end but if she can silence Madame Renauld with her strong hands make a getaway with her little silk ladder whilst we are still battering on the inside of the further door and be back at the Villa Marguerite before we return there it will be hard to prove anything against her.",
    "But she was checkmated\u2014not by Hercule Poirot\u2014but by la petite acrobate with her wrists of steel.\u201d\n\nI mused over the whole story.",
    "\u201cWhen did you first begin to suspect Marthe Daubreuil Poirot When she told us she had overheard the quarrel in the garden\u201d\n\nPoirot smiled.",
    "\u201cMy friend do you remember when we drove into Merlinville that first day And the beautiful girl we saw standing at the gate You asked me if I had not noticed a young goddess and I replied to you that I had seen only a girl with anxious eyes.",
    "That is how I have thought of Marthe Daubreuil from the beginning.",
    "The girl with the anxious eyes Why was she anxious Not on Jack Renauld\u2019s behalf for she did not know then that he had been in Merlinville the previous evening.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy the way\u201d I exclaimed \u201chow is Jack Renauld\u201d\n\n\u201cMuch better.",
    "He is still at the Villa Marguerite.",
    "But Madame Daubreuil has disappeared.",
    "The police are looking for her.\u201d\n\n\u201cWas she in with her daughter do you think\u201d\n\n\u201cWe shall never know.",
    "Madame is a lady who can keep her secrets.",
    "And I doubt very much if the police will ever find her.\u201d\n\n\u201cHas Jack Renauld been\u2014told\u201d\n\n\u201cNot yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt will be a terrible shock to him.\u201d\n\n\u201cNaturally.",
    "And yet do you know Hastings I doubt if his heart was ever seriously engaged.",
    "So far we have looked upon Bella Duveen as a siren and Marthe Daubreuil as the girl he really loved.",
    "But I think that if we reversed the terms we should come nearer to the truth.",
    "Marthe Daubreuil was very beautiful.",
    "She set herself to fascinate Jack and she succeeded but remember his curious reluctance to break with the other girl.",
    "And see how he was willing to go to the guillotine rather than implicate her.",
    "I have a little idea that when he learns the truth he will be horrified\u2014revolted and his false love will wither away.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat about Giraud\u201d\n\n\u201cHe has a crise of the nerves that one He has been obliged to return to Paris.\u201d\n\nWe both smiled.",
    "Poirot proved a fairly true prophet.",
    "When at length the doctor pronounced Jack Renauld strong enough to hear the truth it was Poirot who broke it to him.",
    "The shock was indeed terrific.",
    "Yet Jack rallied better than I could have supposed possible.",
    "His mother\u2019s devotion helped him to live through those difficult days.",
    "The mother and son were inseparable now.",
    "There was a further revelation to come.",
    "Poirot had acquainted Mrs. Renauld with the fact that he knew her secret and had represented to her that Jack should not be left in ignorance of his father\u2019s past.",
    "\u201cTo hide the truth never does it avail madame Be brave and tell him everything.\u201d\n\nWith a heavy heart Mrs. Renauld consented and her son learned that the father he had loved had been in actual fact a fugitive from justice.",
    "A halting question was promptly answered by Poirot.",
    "\u201cReassure yourself M. Jack.",
    "The world knows nothing.",
    "As far as I can see there is no obligation for me to take the police into my confidence.",
    "Throughout the case I have acted not for them but for your father.",
    "Justice overtook him at last but no one need ever know that he and Georges Conneau were one and the same.\u201d\n\nThere were of course various points in the case that remained puzzling to the police but Poirot explained things in so plausible a fashion that all query about them was gradually stilled.",
    "Shortly after we got back to London I noticed a magnificent model of a foxhound adorning Poirot\u2019s mantelpiece.",
    "In answer to my inquiring glance Poirot nodded.",
    "\u201cMais oui I got my 500 francs Is he not a splendid fellow I call him Giraud\u201d\n\nA few days later Jack Renauld came to see us with a resolute expression on his face.",
    "\u201cM.",
    "Poirot I\u2019ve come to say goodbye.",
    "I\u2019m sailing for South America almost immediately.",
    "My father had large interests over the continent and I mean to start a new life out there.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou go alone M. Jack\u201d\n\n\u201cMy mother comes with me\u2014and I shall keep Stonor on as my secretary.",
    "He likes out oftheway parts of the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo one else goes with you\u201d\n\nJack flushed.",
    "\u201cYou mean\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cA girl who loves you very dearly\u2014who has been willing to lay down her life for you.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow could I ask her\u201d muttered the boy.",
    "\u201cAfter all that has happened could I go to her and\u2014oh what sort of a lame story could I tell\u201d\n\n\u201cLes femmes\u2014they have a wonderful genius for manufacturing crutches for stories like that.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes but\u2014I\u2019ve been such a damned fool\u201d\n\n\u201cSo have all of us at one time and another\u201d observed Poirot philosophically.",
    "But Jack\u2019s face had hardened.",
    "\u201cThere\u2019s something else.",
    "I\u2019m my father\u2019s son.",
    "Would any one marry me knowing that\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are your father\u2019s son you say.",
    "Hastings here will tell you that I believe in heredity\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWell then\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWait.",
    "I know a woman a woman of courage and endurance capable of great love of supreme selfsacrifice\u2014\u201d\n\nThe boy looked up.",
    "His eyes softened.",
    "\u201cMy mother\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.",
    "You are your mother\u2019s son as well as your father\u2019s.",
    "Go then to Mademoiselle Bella.",
    "Tell her everything.",
    "Keep nothing back\u2014and see what she will say\u201d\n\nJack looked irresolute.",
    "\u201cGo to her as a boy no longer but a man\u2014a man bowed by the fate of the Past and the fate of Today but looking forward to a new and wonderful life.",
    "Ask her to share it with you.",
    "You may not realize it but your love for each other has been tested in the fire and not found wanting.",
    "You have both been willing to lay down your lives for each other.\u201d\n\nAnd what of Captain Arthur Hastings humble chronicler of these pages\n\nThere is some talk of his joining the Renaulds on a ranch across the seas but for the end of this story I prefer to go back to a morning in the garden of the Villa Genevi\u00e8ve.",
    "\u201cI can\u2019t call you Bella\u201d I said \u201csince it isn\u2019t your name.",
    "And Dulcie seems so unfamiliar.",
    "So it\u2019s got to be Cinderella.",
    "Cinderella married the Prince you remember.",
    "I\u2019m not a Prince but\u2014\u201d\n\nShe interrupted me.",
    "\u201cCinderella warned him I\u2019m sure You see she couldn\u2019t promise to turn into a princess.",
    "She was only a little scullion after all\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the Prince\u2019s turn to interrupt\u201d I interpolated.",
    "\u201cDo you know what he said\u201d\n\n\u201cNo\u201d\n\n\u201c\u200a\u2018Hell\u2019 said the Prince\u2014and kissed her\u201d\n\nAnd I suited the action to the word."
