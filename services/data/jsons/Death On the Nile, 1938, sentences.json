    "She \nflushed and said quickly \u201cYou are right.",
    "A discussion of \nmotives  s beside the point.",
    "The crux of the matter is that \nthis has got to be stopped.\u201d \n\n\u201cAnd how do you propose that that should be accom \nplished Madame\u201d Poirot asked.",
    "\u201cWell\u2014 naturally\u2014 my husband and I cannot continue \nbeing subjected to this annoyance.",
    "There must be some \nkind of legal redress against such a thing.\u201d \n\nShe spoke impatiently.",

    "If it is a young lady\u2019s pleasure to travel in certain places \nand those places are the same where you and your hus \nband find themselves \u2014 eh bien \u2014 what of it The air is free \nto all There is no question of her forcing herself upon \nyour privacy It is always in public that these encounters \ntake place\u201d \n\n\u201cYou mean there is nothing that I can do about it\u201d \n\nLinnet sounded incredulous.",

    "It is that one day a month or two ago I am dining in a \nrestaurant in London.",
    "At the table next to me are two \npeople a man and a girl.",
    "They are very happy so it seems \nvery much in love.",
    "They talk with confidence of the fu \nture.",
    "It is not that I listen to what is not meant for me \nthey are quite oblivious of who hears them and who does \nnot.",
    "The man\u2019s back is to me but I can watch the girl\u2019s \nface.",
    "It is very intense.",
    "She is in love\u2014 heart soul and body \n\u2014and she is not of those who love lightly and often.",
    "With \nher it is clearly the life and the death.",
    "They are engaged \nto be married these two that is what I gather and they \ntalk of where they shall pass the days of their honeymoon.",
    "They plan to go to Egypt.\u201d \n\nHe paused.",
    "Linnet said sharply \u201cWell\u201d \n\nPoirot went on \u201cThat is a month or two ago but the \ngirl\u2019s face\u2014 I do not forget it.",
    "I know that I shall remember \nif I see it again.",
    "And I remember too the man\u2019s voice.",
    "And I think you can guess Madame when it is I see the \none and hear the other again.",
    "It is here in Egypt.",
    "The man \nis on his honeymoon yes\u2014 but he is on his honeymoon \nwith another woman.\u201d \n\nLinnet said sharply \u201cWhat of it I had already men \ntioned the facts.\u201d \n\n\u201cThe facts\u2014 yes.\u201d  \n\n\u201cWell then\u201d I \n\nPoirot said slowly \u201cThe girl in the restaurant men \ntioned a friend\u2014 a friend who she was very positive \nwould not let her down.",
    "That friend I think was you \nMadame.\u201d \n\nLinnet flushed.",
    "\u201cYes.",
    "I told you we had been friends.\u201d \n\n\n1  \n\n\nDeath on the Nile \n\n\n6 1 \n\n\n\u201cAnd she trusted you\u201d \n\n\u201cYes\u201d \n\nShe hesitated for a moment biting her lip impatiently \n\u2022then as Poirot did not seem disposed to speak she broke \nput \n\n\u201cOf course the whole thing was very unfortunate.",
    "But \nhese things happen Monsieur Poirot.\u201d \n\n\u201cAh yes they happen Madame.\u201d He paused.",
    "\u201cYou are \npf the Church of England I presume\u201d \n\n\u201cYes.\u201d Linnet looked slightly bewildered.",
    "\u201cThen you have heard portions of the Bible read aloud \nn church.",
    "You have heard of King David and of the rich \nman who had many flocks and herds and the poor man \nwho had one ewe lamb\u2014 and of how the rich man took the \npoor man\u2019s one ewe lamb.",
    "That was something that hap \npened Madame.\u201d \n\nLinnet sat up.",
    "Her eyes flashed angrily.",
    "\u201cI see perfectly what you are driving at Monsieur \nApirot You think to put it vulgarly that I stole my \nrriend\u2019s young man.",
    "Looking at the matter sentimentally \nwhich is I suppose the way people of your generation \nannot help looking at things\u2014 that is possibly true.",
    "But \nhe real hard truth is different.",
    "I don\u2019t deny that Jackie \nvas passionately in love with Simon but I don\u2019t think \nou take into account that he may not have been equally \nievoted to her.",
    "He was very fond of her but I think that \nven before he met me he was beginning to feel that he \nlad made a mistake.",
    "Look at it clearly Monsieur Poirot \niimon discovers that it is I he loves not Jackie.",
    "What is \nle to do Be heroically noble and marry a woman he does \nlot care for\u2014 and thereby probably ruin three lives\u2014 for it \ns doubtful whether he could make Jackie happy under \n\n\n6i \n\n\nDeath on the Nile \n\n\nthose circumstances If he were actually married to her \nwhen he met me I agree that it might be his duty to stick \nto her\u2014 though I\u2019m not really sure of that.",
    "If one person is \nunhappy the other suffers too.",
    "But an engagement is not \nreally binding.",
    "If a mistake has been made then surely it is \nbetter to face the fact before it is too late.",
    "I admit that it \nwas very hard on Jackie and I\u2019m terribly sorry about it\u2014 \nbut there it is.",
    "It was inevitable.\u201d \n\n\u201cI wonder.\u201d \n\nShe stared at him.",
    "\u201cWhat do you mean\u201d \n\n\u201cIt is very sensible very logical\u2014 all that you say But \nit does not explain one thing.\u201d \n\n\u201cWhat is that\u201d \n\n\u201cYour own attitude Madame.",
    "See you this pursuit of \nyou you might take it in two ways.",
    "It might cause you \nannoyance\u2014 yes or it might stir your pity\u2014 that your friend \nshould have been so deeply hurt as to throw all regards \nfor the conventions aside.",
    "But that is not the way you react.",
    "No to you this persecution is intolerable \u2014 and why It can \nbe for one reason only\u2014 that you feel a sense of guilt.\u201d \n\nLinnet sprang to her feet.",
    "\u201cHow dare you Really Monsieur Poirot this is going \ntoo far.\u201d \n\n\u201cBut I do dare Madame I am going to speak to you \nquite frankly.",
    "I suggest to you that although you may \nhave endeavoured to gloss over the fact to yourself you did \ndeliberately set about taking your husband from your \nfriend.",
    "I suggest that you felt strongly attracted to him at \nonce.",
    "But I suggest that there was a moment when you \nhesitated when you realized that there was a choice \nthat you could refrain or go on.",
    "I suggest that the initia \n\n\nDeath on the Nile \n\n\n63 \n\nfive rested with you \u2014 not with Monsieur Doyle.",
    "You are \nbeautiful Madame you are rich you are clever intelli \ngent\u2014 and you have charm.",
    "You could have exercised that \ncharm or you could have restrained it.",
    "You had every \nthing Madame that life can offer.",
    "Your friend\u2019s life was \nbound up in one person.",
    "You knew that but though you \nhesitated you did not hold your hand.",
    "You stretched it \nout and like the rich man in the Bible you took the poor \nnan\u2019s one ewe lamb.\u201d \n\nThere was a silence.",
    "Linnet controlled herself with an \neffort and said in a cold voice \u201cAll this is quite beside the \npoint\u201d \n\n\u201cNo it is not beside the point.",
    "I am explaining to you \njust why the unexpected appearances of Mademoiselle de \nBellefort have upset you so much.",
    "It is because though she \nmay be unwomanly and undignified in what she is doing \npou have the inner conviction that she has right on her \nside.\u201d \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not true\u201d \n\nPoirot shrugged his shoulders.",
    "\u201cYou refuse to be honest with yourself.\u201d \n\n\u201cNot at all.\u201d \n\nPoirot said gently \u201cI should say Madame that you have \nbad a happy life that you have been generous and kindly \nin your attitude toward others.\u201d \n\n\u201cI have tried to be\u201d said Linnet.",
    "The impatient anger \ndied out of her face.",
    "She spoke simply\u2014 almost forlornly.",
    "\u201cAnd that is why the feeling that you have deliberately \ncaused injury to someone upsets you so much and why \nyou are so reluctant to admit the fact.",
    "Pardon me if I have \naeen impertinent but the psychology it is the most im \naortant fact in a case.\u201d \n\n\nDeath on the Nile \n\n\n64 \n\nLinnet said slowly \u201cEven supposing what you say were \ntrue\u2014 and I don\u2019t admit it mind\u2014 what can be done about \nit now One can\u2019t alter the past one must deal with things \nas they are.\u201d \n\nPoirot nodded.",
    "\u201cYou have the clear brain.",
    "Yes one cannot go back over j \nthe past.",
    "One must accept things as they are.",

    "Bessner followed them.",

    "It must have been \na real fiend who could hurt her And poor Mr. Doyle \nhe\u2019ll just go half crazy when he knows Why even last \nnight he was so frightfully worried lest she should hear \nabout his accident.\u201d \n\n\u201cThat is just what we want you to tell us about Miss \nRobson\u201d said Race.",

    "Fanthorp was reading a book.",

    "\u201cShe was drinking pretty \nheavily.\u201d \n\n\u201cYes\u201d agreed Cornelia.",
    "\u201cShe was talking to me mostly \nand asking me about things at home.",
    "And she kept saying \nthings\u2014 to me mostly but I think they were kind of \nmeant for Mr. Doyle.",
    "He was getting kind of mad at her \nbut he didn\u2019t say anything.",
    "I think he thought if he kept \nquiet she might simmer down.\u201d \n\n\u201cBut she didn\u2019t\u201d \n\nCornelia shook her head.",
    "\u201cI tried to go once or twice but she made me stay and \nI was getting very very uncomfortable.",
    "And then Mr. \nFanthorp got up and went out\u2014\u201d \n\n\u201cIt was a little embarrassing\u201d said Fanthorp.",
    "\u201cI thought \n\n\nDeath on the Nile \n\n\n158 \n\nI\u2019d make an unobtrusive exit.",
    "Miss de Bellefort was clearly \nworking up for a scene.\u201d \n\n\u201cAnd then she pulled out the pistol\u201d went on Cornelia \n\u201cand Mr. Doyle jumped up to try and get it away from \nher and it went off and shot him through the leg and \nthen she began to sob and cry\u2014 and I was scared to death \nand ran out after Mr. Fanthorp and he came back with \nme and Mr. Doyle said not to make a fuss and one of the \nNubian boys heard the noise of the shot and came along \nbut Mr. Fanthorp told him it was all right and then we \ngot Jacqueline away to her cabin and Mr. Fanthorp stayed \nwith her while I got Miss Bowers.\u201d \n\nCornelia paused breathless.",
    "\u201cWhat time was this\u201d asked Race.",
    "Cornelia said again \u201cMercy I don\u2019t know\u201d but Fan \nthorp answered promptly \n\n\u201cIt must have been about twenty minutes past twelve.",
    "I know that it was actually half past twelve when I finally \ngot to my cabin.\u201d \n\n\u201cNow let me be quite sure on one or two points\u201d said \nPoirot.",
    "\u201cAfter Madame Doyle left the saloon did any of \nyou four leave it\u201d \n\n\u201cNo.\u201d \n\n\u201cYou are quite certain Mademoiselle de Bellefort did \nnot leave the saloon at all\u201d \n\nFanthorp answered promptly \u201cPositive.",
    "Neither Doyle \nMiss de Bellefort Miss Robson nor myself left the saloon.\u201d \n\n\u201cGood.",
    "That establishes the fact that Mademoiselle de \nBellefort could not possibly have shot Madame Doyle \nbefore\u2014 let us say\u2014 twenty past twelve.",
    "Now Mademoiselle \nRobson you went to fetch Mademoiselle Bowers.",
    "Was \nMademoiselle de Bellefort alone in her cabin during that \n\n\n\n\nDeath on the Nile \n\n\ni59 \n\n\nperiod\u201d \n\n\u201cNo Mr. Fanthorp stayed with her.\u201d \n\n\u201cGood So far Mademoiselle de Bellefort has a perfect \nalibi.",
    "Mademoiselle Bowers is the next person to interview \nbut before I send for her I should like to have your opin \n\u25a0 lion on one or two points.",
    "Monsieur Doyle you say was \nI very anxious that Mademoiselle de Bellefort should not be \nleft alone.",
    "Was he afraid do you think that she was con \ntemplating some further rash act\u201d \n\n\u201cThat is my opinion\u201d said Fanthorp.",
    "\u201cHe was definitely afraid she might attack Madame \nDoyle\u201d \n\n\u201cNo.\u201d Fanthorp shook his head.",
    "\u201cI don\u2019t think that was \nhis idea at all.",

    "You see she seemed completely sobered and heart \nbroken at what she had done.",
    "She was full of selfreproach.",
    "She kept saying she would be better dead.\u201d \n\n Cornelia said timidly \u201cI think he was rather upset about \nher.",
    "He spoke\u2014 quite nicely.",
    "He said it was all his fault\u2014 \nthat he\u2019d treated her badly.",
    "He\u2014 he was really very nice.\u201d \n\nHercule Poirot nodded thoughtfully.",
    "\u201cNow about the pistol\u201d he went on.",
    "\u201cWhat happened \nto that\u201d \n\n\u201cShe dropped it\u201d said Cornelia.",
    "\u201cAnd afterward\u201d \n\nFanthorp explained how he had gone back to search for \nit but had not been able to find it.",
    "\u201cAha\u201d said Poirot.",
    "\u201cNow we begin to arrive.",
    "Let us I \npray you be very precise.",
    "Describe to me exactly what \nhappened.\u201d \n\n\ni6o \n\n\nDeath on the Nile \n\n\n\u201cMiss de Bellefort let it fall.",
    "Then she kicked it away \nfrom her with her foot.\u201d \n\n\u201cShe sort of hated it\u201d explained Cornelia.",
    "\u201cI know just \nwhat she felt.\u201d \n\n\u201cAnd it went under a settee you say.",
    "Now be very care \nful.",
    "Mademoiselle de Bellefort did not recover that pistol \nbefore she left the saloon\u201d \n\nBoth Fanthorp and Cornelia were positive on that point.",
    "\u201c Frecisement .",
    "I seek only to be very exact you com \nprehend.",
    "Then we arrive at this point.",
    "When Mademoiselle \nde Bellefort leaves the saloon the pistol is under the settee \nand since Mademoiselle de Bellefort is not left alone\u2014 \nMonsieur Fanthorp Mademoiselle Robson or Mademoiselle \nBowers being with her\u2014 she has no opportunity to get back \nthe pistol after she left the saloon.",
    "What time was it Mon \nsieur Fanthorp when you went back to look for it\u201d \n\n\u201cIt must have been just before half past twelve.\u201d \n\n\u201cAnd how long would have elapsed between the time \nyou and Dr. Bessner carried Monsieur Doyle out of the \nsaloon until you returned to look for the pistol\u201d \n\n\u201cPerhaps five minutes\u2014 perhaps a little more.\u201d \n\n\u201cThen in that five minutes someone removes that pistol \nfrom where it lay out of sight under the settee.",
    "That some \none was not Mademoiselle de Bellefort.",
    "Who was it It \nseems highly probable that the person who removed it was \nthe murderer of Madame Doyle.",
    "We may assume too that \nthat person had overheard or seen something of the events \nimmediately preceding.\u201d \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see how you make that out\u201d objected Fan \nthorp.",
    "\u201cBecause\u201d said Hercule Poirot \u201cyou have just told us \nthat the pistol was out of sight under the settee.",
    "Therefore \n\n\nDeath on the Nile \n\n\n161 \n\n\nit is hardly credible that it was discovered by accident.",
    "It \nwas taken by someone who knew it was there.",
    "Therefore \nthat someone must have assisted at the scene.\u201d \n\nFanthorp shook his head.",
    "\u201cI saw no one when I went out \non the deck just before the shot was fired.\u201d \n\n\u201cAh but you went out by the door on the starboard \nside.\u201d \n\n\u201cYes.",
    "The same side as my cabin.\u201d \n\n\u201cThen if there had been anybody at the port door look \ning through the glass you would not have seen him\u201d \n\n\u201cNo\u201d admitted Fanthorp.",
    "\u201cDid anyone hear the shot except the Nubian boy\u201d \n\n\u201cNot as far as I know.\u201d \n\nFanthorp went on \u201cYou see the windows in here were \nall closed.",
    "Miss Van Schuyler felt a draught earlier in the \nevening.",
    "The swing doors were shut.",
    "I doubt if the shot \nwould be at all clearly heard.",
    "It would only sound like the \npop of a cork.\u201d \n\nRace said \u201cAs far as I know no one seems to have heard \nthe other shot\u2014 the shot that killed Mrs. Doyle.\u201d \n\n\u201cThat we will inquire into presently\u201d said Poirot.",
    "\u201cFor \nthe moment we still concern ourselves with Mademoiselle \nde Bellefort.",
    "We must speak to Mademoiselle Bowers.",
    "But \nfirst before you go\u201d\u2014 he arrested Fanthorp and Cornelia \nwith a gesture\u2014 \u201cyou will give me a little information about \nyourselves.",
    "Then it will not be necessary to call you again \nlater.",

    "To me \nhe stumbling block was the pistol\u2014 Jacqueline de Belle \n ort\u2019s pistol.",
    "Why had that pistol not been left on the \ncene of the crime The idea of the murderer was quite \nolainly to incriminate her.",

    "That \nidea was that the crime was committed on the spur of \nthe moment without any preliminary planning.",
    "Somebody \nwished to remove Linnet Doyle and had seized their op \nportunity to do so at a moment when the crime would \nalmost certainly be attributed to Jacqueline de Bellefort.",
    "It therefore followed that the person in question had over \nheard the scene between Jacqueline and Simon Doyle and \nhad obtained possession of the pistol after the others had \nleft the saloon.",
    "\u201cBut my friends if that preconceived idea was wrong \nthe whole aspect of the case altered.",
    "And it was wrong \nThis was no spontaneous crime committed on the spur of \nthe moment.",
    "It was on the contrary very carefully \nplanned and accurately timed with all the details meticu \nlously worked out beforehand even to the drugging of \nHercule Poirot\u2019s bottle of wine on the night in question \n\n\u201cBut yes that is so I was put to sleep so that there \nshould be no possibility of my participating in the events \nof the night.",
    "It did just occur to me as a possibility.",
    "I drink \nwine my two companions at table drink whisky and min 1 \neral water respectively.",
    "Nothing easier than to slip a dose \nof harmless narcotic into my bottle of wine\u2014 the bottles \nstand on the tables all day.",
    "But I dismissed the thought.",
    "It had been a hot day I had been unusually tired it was \n\n\nDeath on the Nile \n\n\n305 \n\n\nnot really extraordinary that I should for once have slept \nheavily instead of lightly as I usually do.",
    "\u201cYou see I was still in the grip of the preconceived \nidea.",
    "If I had been drugged that would have implied pre \nmeditation it would mean that before seventhirty when \ndinner is served the crime had already been decided upon \nand that always from the point of view of the precon \nceived idea was absurd.",
    "\u201cThe first blow to the preconceived idea was when the \npistol was recovered from the Nile.",
    "To begin with if we \nwere right in our assumptions the pistol ought never to \nhave been thrown overboard at all. . . . And there was \n more to follow.\u201d \n\nPoirot turned to Dr. Bessner.",
    "\u201cYou Dr. Bessner examined Linnet Doyle\u2019s body.",
    "You \nwill remember that the wound showed signs of scorch \ning\u2014 that is to say that the pistol had been placed close \nagainst the head before being fired.\u201d \n\nBessner nodded.",
    "\u201cSo.",
    "That is exact.\u201d \n\n\u201cBut when the pistol was found it was wrapped in a \nvelvet stole and that velvet showed definite signs that a \npistol had been fired through its folds presumably under \nthe impression that that would deaden the sound of the \nshot.",
    "But if the pistol had been fired through the velvet \nthere would have been no signs of burning on the vic \ntim\u2019s skin.",
    "Therefore the shot fired through the stole could \nnot have been the shot that killed Linnet Doyle.",
    "Could it \nhave been the other shot\u2014 the one fired by Jacqueline de \nBellefort at Simon Doyle Again no for there had been \ntwo witnesses of that shooting and we knew all about it.",
    "It appeared therefore as though a third shot had been \nfired\u2014 one we knew nothing about.",
    "But only two shots had \n\n\nDeath on the Nile \n\n\n30 6 \n\nbeen fired from the pistol and there was no hint or sug \ngestion of another shot.",
    "\u201cHere we were face to face with a very curious un \nexplained circumstance.",
    "The next interesting point was \nthe fact that in Linnet Doyle\u2019s cabin I found two bottles \nof coloured nail polish.",
    "Now ladies very often vary the \ncolour of their nails but so far Linnet Doyle\u2019s nails had \nalways been the shade called Cardinal\u2014 a deep dark red \nThe other bottle was labelled Rose which is a shade of \npale pink but the few drops remaining in the bottle were \nnot pale pink but a bright red.",
    "I was sufficiently curious \nto take out the stopper and sniff.",
    "Instead of the usual strong \nodour of pear drops the bottle smelt of vinegar That is \nto say it suggested that the drop or two of fluid in it was \nred ink.",
    "Now there is no reason why Madame Doyle should \nnot have had a bottle of red ink but it would have been \nmore natural if she had had red ink in a red ink bottle \nand not in a nail polish bottle.",
    "It suggested a link with the \nfaintly stained handkerchief which had been wrapped \nround the pistol.",
    "Red ink washes out quickly but always \nleaves a pale pink stain.",
    "\u201cI should perhaps have arrived at the truth with these \nslender indications but an event occurred which rendered \nall doubt superfluous.",
    "Louise Bourget was killed in cir \ncumstances which pointed unmistakably to the fact that \nshe had been blackmailing the murderer.",
    "Not only was a \nfragment of a mille franc note still clasped in her hand \nbut I remembered some very significant words she had \nused this morning.",
    "\u201cListen carefully for here is the crux of the whole mat \nter.",
    "When I asked her if she had seen anything the pre \nvious night she gave this very curious answer \u2018Naturally  \n\n\nDeath on the Nile \n\n\n3\u00b07 \n\nj c I had been unable to sleep if I had mounted the stairs \nhen perhaps I might have seen this assassin this monster \nnter or leave Madame\u2019s cabin.",
    ". . .\u2019 Now what exactly \nid that tell us\u201d \n\nBessner his nose wrinkling with intellectual interest re \ndied promptly \u201cIt told you that she had mounted the \ntair.\u201d \n\n\u201cNo no you fail to see the point.",
    "Why should she \niave said that to us\u201d \n\n\u201cTo convey a hint.\u201d \n\n\u201cBut why hint to us If she knows who the murderer \nL there are two courses open to her\u2014 to tell us the truth \nr to hold her tongue and demand money for her silence \nrom the person concerned But she does neither.",
    "She \nleither says promptly \u2018I saw nobody.",
    "I was asleep.\u2019 Nor \nloes she say \u2018Yes I saw someone and it was so and so.\u2019 \nVhy use that significant indeterminate rigmarole of \nvords Tar bleu there can be only one reason She is hint \nng to the murderer therefore the murderer must have \noeen present at the time.",
    "But besides myself and Colonel \nlace only two people were present\u2014 Simon Doyle and \nDr. Bessner.\u201d \n\nThe doctor sprang up with a roar.",
    "\u201cAch what is that you say You accuse me Again \n3ut it is ridiculous\u2014 beneath contempt.\u201d \n\nPoirot said sharply \u201cBe quiet.",
    "I am telling you what I \nhought at the time.",
    "Let us remain impersonal.\u201d \n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t mean he thinks it\u2019s you now\u201d said Cor \nlelia soothingly.",
    "Poirot went on quickly \u201cSo it lay there\u2014 between Simon \nDoyle and Dr. Bessner.",
    "But what reason has Bessner to \ntill Linnet Doyle None so far as I know.",
    "Simon Doyle \n\n\nDeath on the Nile \n\n\n308 \n\nthen But that was impossible There were plenty of wii ti \nnesses who could swear that Doyle never left the salooji \nthat evening until the quarrel broke out.",
    "After that he wI i \nwounded and it would then have been physically impo \nsible for him to have done so.",
    "Had I good evidence 0 \nboth those points Yes I had the evidence of Mademoiselli \nRobson of Jim Fanthorp and of Jacqueline de Bellefoj \nas to the first and I had the skilled testimony of Dr. Bess \nner and of Mademoiselle Bowers as to the other.",
    "No dout \nwas possible.",
    "\u201cSo Dr. Bessner must be the guilty one.",
    "In favour 0 \nthis theory there was the fact that the maid had bee \nstabbed with a surgical knife.",
    "On the other hand Bessne \nhad deliberately called attention to this fact.",
    "\u201cAnd then my friends a second perfectly indisputabl \nfact became apparent to me.",
    "Louise Bourget\u2019s hint coult \nnot have been intended for Dr. Bessner because she coulr \nperfectly well have spoken to him in private at any tim \nshe liked.",
    "There was one person and one person only wh \ncorresponded to her necessity\u2014 Simon Doyle Simon DoyL \nwas wounded was constantly attended by a doctor wa \nin that doctor\u2019s cabin.",
    "It was to him therefore that sh \nrisked saying those ambiguous words in case she migh \nnot get another chance.",
    "And I remembered how she hat \ngone on turning to him \u2018Monsieur I implore you\u2014 ym \nsee how it is What can I say\u2019 And his answer \u2018My goot \ngirl don\u2019t be a fool.",
    "Nobody thinks you saw or heart \nanything.",
    "You\u2019ll be quite all right.",
    "I\u2019ll look after you.",
    "No \nbody\u2019s accusing you of anything.\u2019 That was the assurance \nshe wanted and she got it\u201d \n\nBessner uttered a colossal snort.",
    "\u201cAch it is foolish that Do you think a man with \u00a3 \n\n\nDeath on the Nile \n\n\n309 \n\n\nractured bone and a splint on his leg could go walking \n3pout the boat and stabbing people I tell you it was \nwn possible for Simon Doyle to leave his cabin.\u201d \n\nPoirot said gently \u201cI know.",
    "That is quite true.",
    "The \nling was impossible.",
    "It was impossible but it was also \nue There could be only one logical meaning behind \nouise Bourget\u2019s words.",
    "\u201cSo I returned to the beginning and reviewed the crime \nt the light of this new knowledge.",
    "Was it possible that \nl the period preceding the quarrel Simon Doyle had left \nle saloon and the others had forgotten or not noticed it \ncould not see that that was possible.",

    "It \nwould be easy enough for me to pretend to hate Simon \nt was quite a likely thing to happen under the circum \ntances.",

    "We worked out details little by little.",
    "I wanted it to \n\u00bbe so that if anything went wrong they\u2019d get me and \nlot Simon.",
