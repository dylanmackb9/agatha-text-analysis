    "No secrets in the East are there\nNo sir.",
    "If you ask me there arent any secrets anywhere.",

    "If an understanding could be reached...",
    "He stopped.",
    "Crosbie still looked doubtful.",
    "Forgive me sir  is any agreement possible\nProbably not.",

    "But we go on\nYes.",
    "What about Crofton Lee\nHes agreed to come.",

    "It must therefore be very urgent.",
    "And Carmichael had\nmanaged to pass this chit to his old school friend.",
    "It must therefore be very\nimportant  and Carmichaels enemies would look for it.",
    "What then should Richard do with it\nHe would keep it until Carmichael came for it  but first he must make it\nsafe.",
    "Tearing half a sheet from an old letter Baker sat down to write a chit for a\nlorry driver but using different words  if this message was a code that would be\nthe end of that.",
    "Then he covered the new chit with dust from his shoes and\nfolded and refolded it until it looked old and dirty.",

    "What a showoff.",
    "thought Victoria irritated.",
    "She saw with some pleasure\nthat Sir Rupert had a boil starting on the back of his neck  it made the great man\nseem more human.",
    "Stopping first in Cairo en route for Baghdad Mrs Hamilton Clipp said that\nshe was going to sleep until six and suggested that Victoria might like to see the\nPyramids.",
    "Ive arranged a car for you Miss Jones.",

    "But she\ncertainly is a very charming and capable girl.",
    "Ha the voice said.",
    "Victoria decided to avoid this lady and started to consider her situation.",

    "Sitting a little way along was a man with grey hair curling down on to\nhis redbrown neck.",
    "With surprise Victoria recognized Sir Rupert Crofton Lee.",
    "Why she was surprised she could not say.",
    "Perhaps because she thought an\nimportant man such as Sir Rupert would have been staying at the Embassy.",
    "But\nhere he was staring at the Tigris.",
    "After breakfast Victoria went to look for the Olive Branch.",
    "Baghdad was completely different from her idea of it  people shouting and\na main road filled with cars sounding their horns angrily.",
    "In the shop windows\nthere was a strange mixture of European goods babies shoes and woollen\nclothes toothpaste and face creams electric torches and china cups and saucers\nall shown together.",

    "The road was in poor condition with the\noccasional large hole.",
    "She felt lost and far from home.",
    "Here there was no beauty only confusion.",

    "Looking along an alley\nVictoria saw the Copper Bazaar.",

    "Balek\n\n\fA donkey carrying a huge load made Victoria step aside into a dark alley\nthat turned and twisted between tall houses.",
    "There by chance she looked into a\ncourtyard and at its far side was a doorway with a huge sign THE OLIVE\nBRANCH.",

    "Dr Rathbones secretary said Victoria loudly and clearly.",
    "He particularly\ntold me to ask for him.",
    "A growing determination to win the argument showed on the young\nwomans face.",
    "Not today she said.",
    "We do not interrupt.",
    "Unhappily instead of the Olive Branch creating friendly feelings it\nseemed to be having the opposite effect.",
    "I have just arrived from England Victoria insisted.",
    "Please take me to Dr\nRathbone at once At once\nThe young woman turned and led Victoria to the back of the room up a\nstaircase and along a passage.",
    "She knocked at a door.",
    "Come in.",
    "Victorias guide opened the door.",

    "Edwards\ngood at that sort of thing.",
    "Hes a fine young man.",
    "His eyes twinkled.",
    "But I dont suppose I need to sing Edwards praises to\nyou young lady\nWhen  when will Edward be back from Basrah asked Victoria\nhopefully.",
    "Not till hes finished the job  and you cant hurry things in this country.",
    "Tell me where you are staying and Ill make sure he gets in touch as soon as hes\nhere.",
    "I was wondering if I could do some work here Victoria spoke urgently\nthinking of her money troubles.",
    "Yes of course you can be most valuable said Dr Rathbone warmly.",
    "Our\nwork is going very well  but theres lots more to do.",
    "Ive got thirty volunteers\nalready  all of them very enthusiastic\nVolunteering would not help Victoria.",
    "I really wanted a paid job she said.",
    "Oh dear Dr Rathbone lost his smile.",
    "Thats difficult.",
    "Our paid staff is\n\n\fvery small  and with the volunteers its enough.",
    "I really must find a job explained Victoria.",
    "My dear young lady I hope youll help us in your spare time.",
    "Most of our\nworkers have their own jobs.",
    "Youll find it a great experience to help us.",

    "For example that girl Catherine who brought you up here.",
    "Shes a\nSyrian from Damascus.",
    "Normally you and she would never have met.",
    "But at the\nOlive Branch you and she and many others all meet and like each other  thats\nhow the world is meant to be.",
    "Victoria could not help thinking that Dr Rathbone was fooling himself.",
    "She\nand Catherine for instance had not liked each other at all.",
    "And Victoria strongly\nsuspected that the more they saw of each other the greater their dislike would\ngrow.",
    "Edwards excellent said Dr Rathbone.",
    "Friends with everybody.",
    "All the\ngirls admire Edward theyll do anything for him.",
    "He and Catherine get on\nparticularly well.",

    "She returned to the hotel.",
    "Trying not to think about her own problems  a\ngirl in Baghdad without any money  instead she considered Dr Rathbone and\nthe Olive Branch.",
    "Edward had an idea that there was something not right about\nDr Rathbone.",
    "But Victoria thought that he was just one of those people who are\n\n\fso sure of what they believe that they cannot see what the world is really like.",
    "CHAPTER ELEVEN\nVictoria arrived back at the Hotel Tio with sore feet.",
    "Marcus who was\nsitting out on the terrace overlooking the river and talking to a thin rather tiredlooking middleaged man called out to her enthusiastically.",
    "Come and have a drink with us Miss Jones.",
    "This is Mr Dakin.",
    "Now then\nmy dear what will you have\nVictoria said she would have a cocktail and she suggested hopefully some\nof those lovely nuts.",

    "Ah cried Marcus here is Mrs Cardew Trench.",
    "You know Mr Dakin\nWhat will you have\nGin and lime said Mrs Cardew Trench nodding to Dakin.",
    "You look hot\nshe added to Victoria.",
    "Ive been walking around seeing the city.",
    "When the drinks came Victoria ate a large plateful of nuts and some potato\nchips.",
    "After a while a short solidlooking man came up the steps and Marcus\nintroduced him to Victoria as Captain Crosbie.",
    "Just arrived he asked her.",
    "Yesterday.",
    "I didnt think I had seen you before.",
    "She is very nice and beautiful is she not said Marcus joyfully.",
    "Oh yes it\nis very nice to have Miss Victoria.",
    "I will give a very nice party for her.",
    "Oh it is\nvery good.",
    "We will have a long dinner that goes on for hours.",
    "That will be lovely said Victoria feeling quite weak with hunger.",
    "I thought youd gone to Basrah said Mrs Cardew Trench to Crosbie.",
    "I got back yesterday said Crosbie.",
    "He looked up at the balcony.",
    "Whos that he asked.",
    "The man in the big hat.",
    "That my dear is Sir Rupert Crofton Lee said Marcus.",
    "He came last night\n\n\ffrom the British Embassy.",
    "He is a very nice man a great traveller.",
    "He rides on\ncamels over the Sahara and climbs up mountains.",
    "It is very uncomfortable and\ndangerous that kind of life.",
    "I would not like it myself.",
    "Oh hes that man is he said Crosbie.",
    "Ive read his book.",
    "I came over on the plane with him said Victoria.",
    "Both men or so it seemed to her looked at her with interest.",
    "Hes very pleased with himself said Victoria.",
    "I knew his aunt in India said Mrs Cardew Trench.",
    "The whole family is\nlike that.",
    "They are terribly clever but they cant help telling everyone.",
    "Another drink Marcus demanded.",
    "Not for me said Victoria quickly.",
    "Thanking Marcus for the drink Victoria went up and lay down on her bed\nto do some serious thinking.",
    "How long would it be before Marcus presented her\nbill\nShe had no idea.",
    "When would Edward get back from Basrah Perhaps she thought\nhorrified Edward would have forgotten all about her.",
    "Why on earth had she\ncome rushing out to Baghdad in this silly way\nShe must get a job  any job.",
    "If not they would take her to a Consul and\nshe would be sent back to England and never see Edward again...\nAt this point exhausted from all the emotion Victoria fell asleep.",
    "She woke hours later and decided Its no good worrying anymore.",
    "So\ngoing down to the restaurant she ate the entire menu.",
    "When she had finished\nshe felt very very full but much happier.",
    "Before going to bed she went out on to the terrace.",
    "One of the waiters was\nstanding beside the railing looking down into the water.",
    "He jumped guiltily\nwhen Victoria appeared and hurried back into the hotel by the service door.",
    "Victoria was delighted by the Tigris in the moonlight.",
    "Well anyway Ive got here said Victoria to herself feeling much happier\nand Ill manage somehow.",
    "Everything will be alright in the end.",
    "As she went up to bed the waiter came quietly out again and finished what\nhe had been trying to do which was to tie a rope so that it hung down to the\nriver.",
    "Having done this Mr Dakin went back into the shadows where he changed\nfrom the waiters white coat back into his own blue suit.",
    "Soon another man joined him.",
    "Dakin asked in a low voice Everything\nalright\nYes sir nothing suspicious to report Crosbie said quietly.",
    "Whos the\ngirl\nShe says shes the niece of the archaeologist Pauncefoot Jones.",
    "But she came on the same plane as Crofton Lee...",
    "Yes we must be careful said Dakin.",
    "Crosbie replied Do you really think its best to move from the Embassy to\nhere in spite of the whole thing being planned to the smallest detail\nIt was planned to the smallest detail in Basrah  and that ended with Salah\nHassan poisoned and a shooting at the Consulate.",
    "If our plans are known its\neasy for the other side to act.",
    "I doubt\nCarmichael could get near the Embassy  and even if he did...",
    "He shook\nhis head.",
    "Here only you and I and Crofton Lee know whats going on.",
    "Theyll know Crofton Lee moved here from the Embassy.",
    "Of course.",
    "But Crosbie whatever the enemy does theyve got to do it\nquickly and without planning.",
    "They couldnt possibly have put someone into the\nTio six months ago  to be ready and waiting.",
    "The Tios never been part of the\nplan until now.",
    "He looked at his watch.",
    "Ill go up and see Crofton Lee now.",
    "Sir Ruperts door opened silently to let Dakin in.",
    "There was only one small\nlamp on and the traveller had placed his chair beside it.",
    "As he sat down again he\nput a small gun onto the table.",
    "Whats your opinion Dakin Do you think\nCarmichael will come\nYes Sir Rupert.",
    "Then he said Youve never met him have you\nNo.",
    "Sir Rupert looked at him sharply.",
    "Youve got the place guarded\nCrosbies on the balcony and I shall be watching the stairs.",
    "When\nCarmichael reaches you knock on the wall and Ill come in.",
    "Crofton Lee nodded.",
    "Dakin went quietly out of the room.",
    "CHAPTER TWELVE\nVictoria having slept most of the afternoon didnt feel sleepy at all.",
    "So she\nsat down and wrote several advertisements to find work a telegram asking for\nhelp from her only living relative a very old and unpleasant gentleman who had\nnever helped anybody in his life then she tried out a new hair style and finally\nwith a sudden sigh she was ready for bed.",
    "At that moment her bedroom door opened a man came in locked the door\nand said to her urgently Please hide me  quickly.",
    "Victorias reactions were never slow.",
    "In a second she had noted the painful\nbreathing the weak voice and the desperate way the man held an old red knitted\nscarf against his chest.",
    "She responded immediately to the adventure.",
    "The bed was large  and memories of playing hideandseek as a child\nmade Victoria say Quick.",
    "She pushed off the pillows and opened the sheet and\nblanket.",
    "The man lay across the top of the bed.",
    "Victoria pulled the sheet and\nblanket over him and put the pillows on top.",
    "Almost immediately there was a knock at the door.",
    "Open the door please.",
    "It is the police said a mans voice.",
    "As Victoria crossed the room she noticed the red knitted scarf on the floor.",
    "She picked it up and put it into a drawer then opening the door a little she\nlooked out nervously.",
    "A darkhaired young man in a striped suit was outside and behind him was\na man in police uniform.",
    "Whats the matter Victoria asked in alarm.",
    "The young man smiled brightly.",
    "I am so sorry miss to trouble you at this hour but a criminal has escaped.",
    "He has run into this hotel.",
    "We must look in every room.",
    "He is very dangerous.",
    "Oh dear Victoria stepped back opening the door wide.",
    "How frightening\nLook in the bathroom please.",
    "Oh And the wardrobe  and under the bed He\nmight have been there all evening.",
    "The search was very quick.",
    "No he is not here.",
    "Youre sure\n\n\fThank you miss.",
    "The young man bowed and they left.",
    "Victoria relocked the door and turned to the bed.",
    "She had probably been\nvery foolish  letting her romantic nature put her on the side of the hunted\nagainst the hunter.",
    "She said abruptly Theyve gone.",
    "You can get up now.",
    "There was no movement under the pillows.",
    "Impatiently Victoria threw\nthem off.",
    "The young man lay as she had left him.",
    "But now his face was grey his\neyes were closed and a bright red mark was spreading on the blanket.",
    "Oh no said Victoria.",
    "Oh no\nThe wounded man opened his eyes and looked at her as though from very\nfar away.",
    "His lips opened  the sound was so quiet that Victoria had to move very\nclose.",
    "What\nWith great difficulty the young man said two words.",
    "Lucifer  Basrah...\nHis eyes closed.",
    "He said one word more.",
    "Then he lay still.",
    "Victorias heart was beating violently.",
    "She was filled with pity and anger.",
    "A sound made her turn  the key had fallen out of her door.",
    "She heard the\nlock turning.",
    "The door opened and Mr Dakin came in closing the door behind\nhim.",
    "He walked across to her saying quietly Nice work my dear.",
    "You think\nquickly.",
    "How is he\nWith a break in her voice Victoria said Hes  hes dead.",
    "She saw the others face change saw a flash of violent anger then it was\ngone  only now it seemed to her that the tiredness she had seen in his face\nyesterday had gone too and that something quite different was in its place.",
    "He gently opened the dead mans jacket.",
    "He was stabbed through the heart said Dakin as he stood up.",
    "Carmichael\nwas a brave man  and a clever one.",
    "Victoria managed to say The police came.",
    "They said he was a criminal.",
    "No.",
    "He wasnt a criminal.",
    "Were they really the police\nThey may have been said Dakin.",
    "Did he say anything  before he died\nYes.",
    "Lucifer  and then Basrah.",
    "And then he said  I think it was a French\nname  it sounded like Lefarge.",
    "What does it all mean And what must I do\nI dont want you connected with this if thats possible said Dakin.",
    "Ill\ncome back later and tell you what its all about.",
    "The first thing to do is to get\nhold of Marcus.",
    "Just do something about your appearance before I bring him in.",
    "Marcus will always help a beautiful woman in distress.",
    "He left the room.",
    "As though in a dream Victoria combed back her hair\nmade up her face so it seemed white with shock and fell on to a chair as Dakin\ncame in.",
    "Behind him came Marcus Tio.",
    "This time there was not the usual smile\non his face.",
    "Now Marcus said Mr Dakin you must do what you can about this.",
    "Its\nbeen a terrible shock to this poor girl.",
    "The man ran in  shes got a very kind\nheart and she hid him from the police.",
    "And now hes dead.",
    "Of course she did said Marcus.",
    "Nobody likes the police.",
    "I do not like the\npolice.",
    "But I have to keep good relations with them because of my hotel.",
    "You\nwant me to give them money\nWe want you to take the body away quietly.",
    "That is very nice I agree.",
    "I too I do not want a body in my hotel.",
    "But it is\nnot so easy to do.",
    "I think it could be said Dakin.",
    "Youve got a doctor in your family havent\nyou\nYes Paul my sisters husband.",
    "But I do not want him in trouble.",
    "He wont be said Dakin.",
    "Listen Marcus.",
    "We move the body into my\nroom.",
    "That way Miss Jones is no longer involved.",
    "Then I use your telephone.",
    "In\nten minutes a young man comes into the hotel he is very drunk he holds his\nside.",
    "He shouts for me.",
    "He walks into my room and falls.",
    "I come out and ask you\nfor a doctor.",
    "Your brotherinlaw sends for an ambulance and goes in it with this\ndrunken friend of mine.",
    "Before they get to the hospital my friend is dead.",
    "He\nhas been stabbed in the street before coming into your hotel.",
    "That is all right for\n\n\fyou.",
    "And the young man who plays the drunk he goes away quietly.",
    "And there\nis no body found in my hotel And Miss Jones does not get any worry I think\nthat is a very good idea.",
    "CHAPTER THIRTEEN\nVictoria lay in bed listening.",
    "She heard loud drunken arguing.",
    "Heard a\nvoice insisting I had a fight with a man outside.",
    "She heard bells ring.",
    "More\nvoices and a lot of movement.",
    "Then silence.",
    "She heard the gentle opening of her\ndoor and sat up in bed and switched on the lamp.",
    "Dakin brought a chair up to the bed sat down and looked at her as if he\nwas a doctor.",
    "Tell me what its all about demanded Victoria.",
    "Suppose said Dakin that you tell me all about yourself first.",
    "Why did\nyou come to Baghdad\nVictoria thought afterwards that it was something in Dakins personality\nbut for once she simply told him everything her meeting with Edward her\ndetermination to get to Baghdad and the wonderful luck of Mrs Hamilton Clipp.",
    "I see said Dakin when she had finished.",
    "The point is you are involved in\nthis whether I like it or not.",
    "So you might as well work for me.",
    "Youve got a job for me Victoria said hopefully.",
    "This job Victoria is dangerous.",
    "Oh thats all right said Victoria happily.",
    "She added doubtfully Its not\ndishonest is it I know I tell an awful lot of lies but I wouldnt like to do\nanything dishonest.",
    "Dakin smiled.",
    "Strangely enough your ability to invent a good lie quickly\nis one of your qualifications for the job.",
    "No its not dishonest.",
    "In fact you will\nbe working for law and order.",
    "Have you thought much about world politics\nI know everybody says theres going to be another war sooner or later.",
    "Between Russia and America.",
    "Exactly said Mr Dakin.",
    "Therefore everything depends on them agreeing\nwith each other.",
    "Instead the opposite is happening.",
    "Every time there is a chance\nof agreement something happens to create more distrust or hysterical fear.",
    "These\nthings are not accidents Victoria they are deliberate  a group is working\nundercover to cause this destruction.",
    "A group that wants to take control.",
    "But how do you know\nMoney Victoria.",
    "Money is always the clue to what is happening in the\n\n\fworld  its the key to any plan.",
    "A group of people are cleverly moving very large\nsums of money around and using that money to create conflict.",
    "But who are these people\nIdealists who intend I fear to make the world better To think that you\ncan force Perfection on the human race is one of the most dangerous ideas in\nexistence.",
    "The belief that some men are Supermen and therefore good enough to\nrule the world  that Victoria is the most evil of all beliefs.",
    "For when you say I\nam not like other men you have lost the two most valuable qualities humility\nand brotherhood.",
    "He sighed.",
    "Well I mustnt preach a sermon.",
    "What we know is that in the\npast two years many of the best young scientists have disappeared.",
    "The same\nhas happened with engineers and other people with valuable skills.",
    "And we are\nbeginning to guess what they are doing.",
    "Victoria listened with increasing concern.",
    "There is a remote part of the world protected by mountains and deserts\nthat is only visited by exceptional travellers.",
    "It can be reached from China or the\nHimalayas but the journey is hard and long.",
    "Machines and people from all over\nthe world are being sent there.",
    "One man followed that route.",
    "What he found was so incredible that when\nhe got back to civilization only two people believed his story.",
    "One was myself\nand because he had been to these remote regions the other was Sir Rupert\nCrofton Lee.",
    "It was from one of these journeys that Sir Rupert brought back\nsome uraniumrich rock.",
    "The result was that Carmichael a man who works for us in the\nintelligence service decided to go on a desperate journey We heard nothing for\nnine months then news came.",
    "Hed got what he went to get.",
    "Proof.",
    "But the other\nside knew about him and their agents were already inside our whole system some at a very high level.",
    "Somehow or other Carmichael got through safely until tonight.",
    "Then that was  the dead man in my room\nYes my dear.",
    "A very brave young man.",
    "But what about the proof Did they get it\nA slow smile showed on Dakins tired face.",
    "Knowing Carmichael Im sure\n\n\fthey didnt.",
    "But he died without being able to tell us where that proof is.",
    "I think\nhe tried to give us a clue.",
    "He repeated slowly Lucifer  Basrah  Lefarge.",
    "Hed\nbeen in Basrah  he tried to report at the Consulate and was very nearly shot.",
    "Its\npossible that he left the proof in Basrah.",
    "What I want you to do Victoria is to go\nthere and try to find out.",
    "Me Id love to go to Basrah said Victoria with enthusiasm.",
    "Dakin\nsmiled.",
    "It suits you because your young man is there eh What a very good reason\nfor going there.",
    "Nothing could seem more natural.",
    "You go to Basrah and look for\nwhat Lucifer and Lefarge mean.",
    "What do I use for money said Victoria in a businesslike way.",
    "I did some\nreading on the plane and its about three hundred and forty miles to Basrah.",
    "Dakin handed her a roll of paper money.",
    "Talk to Mrs Cardew Trench tomorrow morning say you want to visit\nBasrah before you go off to this dig youre pretending to work at.",
    "Shell tell you\nat once that you must stay at the Consulate and will send a telegram to Mrs\nClayton.",
    "Youll probably find your Edward there  everyone who passes through\nstays with the Claytons.",
    "Apart from that I give you one warning.",
    "If  er anything unpleasant happens if youre asked what you know  dont try and be a\nhero.",
    "Tell them everything at once.",
    "Thank you said Victoria.",
    "Im rather afraid of pain and if anyone were to\ntorture me Im afraid I wouldnt be brave.",
    "They wont torture you said Mr Dakin.",
    "Tortures very old fashioned.",
    "Theyll put a drug in your arm and youll answer every question truthfully.",
    "Thats\nwhy I didnt want you to get grand ideas of secrecy.",
    "What about Edward Do I tell him\nDakin thought for a moment.",
    "That would put him in danger too.",
    "But I understand he had a good record\nin the Air Force.",
    "I dont suppose danger will worry him.",
    "Two heads are often\nbetter than one.",
    "And he thinks theres something suspicious about this Olive\nBranch hes working for.",
    "Thats interesting.",
    "Why\nBecause we think so too said Dakin.",
    "Then he added And keep your ears open for any mention of a young\nwoman called Anna Scheele.",
    "We would really like to know much more about\nher.",
    "CHAPTER FOURTEEN\nA car met Victoria at the station she was driven to the Consulate and in\nthrough big gates into a delightful garden.",
    "The car stopped in front of steps\nleading up to a balcony surrounding the house.",
    "Mrs Clayton a smiling energetic\nwoman came through a door at the top of the steps to meet her.",
    "Were so pleased to see you she said.",
    "Basrahs really delightful at this\ntime of year though theres no one here now except Dr Rathbones young man\nwhos quite charming.",
    "What would you like first  a bath or some coffee\nA bath please said Victoria gratefully.",
    "If possible Victoria hoped to meet Edward alone.",
    "With this in mind when\nshe had bathed and put on a summer dress she went quietly out to sit on the\nbalcony.",
    "The first to arrive was a tall thin man with a thoughtful face and as he\ncame up the steps Victoria went to stand out of sight round the corner of the\nbalcony.",
    "As she did so she saw Edward entering through a garden gate that\nopened on to the river.",
    "Victoria called out quietly.",
    "Up here.",
    "Edward who was Victoria thought more attractive than ever turned\nquickly  and complete surprise appeared on his face.",
    "My goodness Victoria\nQuiet.",
    "Wait for me.",
    "Im coming down.",
    "Victoria ran round the balcony down the steps and along to where Edward\nstood confusion still on his face.",
    "I cant be drunk so early in the day said Edward.",
    "It is you.",
    "Yes its me said Victoria happily.",
    "But... its unbelievable.",
    "How did you get here\nI flew.",
    "I mean what wonderful chance brought you to Basrah\nThe train said Victoria.",
    "Youre doing it on purpose you little witch.",
    "I am so pleased to see you.",
    "But how did you get here  really\nI came out with an American woman whod broken her arm.",
    "I was offered\n\n\fthe job the day after I met you and youd talked about Baghdad so I thought\nwhy not see the world\nYou really are great fun Victoria.",
    "But what are you doing now\nIm still seeing the world said Victoria.",
    "But Ive had to do a few tricks.",
    "The idea is that I am Miss Pauncefoot Jones.",
    "My uncle is a famous archaeologist\nwho is working out here and I am joining him soon.",
    "Oh excellent thats a good story.",
    "But what will happen if you and Jones\ncome face to face\nI dont think that is likely.",
    "From what I hear once archaeologists start to\ndig they go on digging like mad and dont stop.",
    "I say you really are wonderful Victoria said Edward admiringly.",
    "Ive\nnever met anyone like you.",
    "Edwards admiring look caused Victoria great satisfaction.",
    "If she had been\na cat she would have purred.",
    "And you will actually want a job wont you said Edward.",
    "Yes said\nVictoria I actually went into your Olive Branch and asked Dr Rathbone for a\njob but he wasnt helpful.",
    "The old man is tight with his money said Edward.",
    "He wants everybody\nto work for love.",
    "Do you think hes a fake.",
    "Edward\nI dont know exactly what I think.",
    "He doesnt make any money.",
    "So far as I\ncan see all that enthusiasm is real.",
    "And yet you know I dont believe hes a\nfool.",
    "Wed better go in said Victoria.",
    "We can talk later.",
    "Id no idea you and Edward knew each other said Mrs Clayton.",
    "Oh were old friends laughed Victoria.",
    "Only wed lost contact.",
    "Id no idea\nEdward was here.",
    "Mr Clayton who was the man Victoria had seen coming up the steps\nasked How did you get on this morning Edward Any progress\nOh the books are there sir but the forms to get them are unending.",
    "The\nperson you need always seems to be away that day.",
    "Everyone is very willing \n\n\fonly nothing seems to happen.",
    "Everyone laughed and Mrs Clayton said Youll\nget them in the end.",
    "It was very wise of Dr Rathbone to send someone down\npersonally.",
    "As everything was closed during the midday hours Edward and Victoria\nwent out after lunch to see the sights.",
    "Victoria was delighted with the Shatt el\nArab River and the palm trees beside it.",
    "She loved the Arab boats tied up in the\ncanal in the town.",
    "They walked slowly into the souk.",
    "When they turned towards\nthe Consulate and Edward was preparing to leave for work Victoria asked\nsuddenly Edward whats your last name I dont know it.",
    "Edward stared at her.",
    "Dont you No I suppose you dont.",
    "Its Goring.",
    "Edward Goring.",
    "Youve no idea what a fool I felt going into that Olive\nBranch place and wanting to ask for you and not knowing anything but Edward.",
    "Was there a darkskinned girl there With rather long hair\nYes.",
    "Thats Catherine.",
    "If you said Edward shed know.",
    "I am sure she would said Victoria without enthusiasm.",
    "Shes a very nice\ngirl.",
    "Didnt you think so\nOh...",
    "Very kind.",
    "Is she Victorias voice was now as cold as ice  but Edward did not seem\nto notice.",
    "I dont know what I would have done without her.",
    "Im sure you and she\nwill be great friends.",
    "I dont think well have the chance.",
    "Oh yes you will.",
    "Im going to get you a job there.",
    "How are you going to manage that\nI dont know but I shall manage it somehow.",
    "If not next thing I know\nyoull be heading for Burma.",
    "No young Victoria Im not going to take any\nchances I dont want you running away from me.",
    "Youre too fond of seeing the\nworld.",
    "You sweet fool thought Victoria to herself dont you know that nothing\nwould drive me away from Baghdad now\n\n\fAloud she said Well it would be fun to have a job at the Olive Branch.",
    "I wouldnt describe it as fun.",
    "The organization means well but its all a bit\nsilly too.",
    "And do you still think theres something wrong about it\nOh that was only a wild idea of mine.",
    "No said Victoria thoughtfully I think its true.",
    "Edward turned on her quickly.",
    "What makes you say that\nSomething I heard  from a friend of mine.",
    "Who was it\nJust a friend.",
    "Girls like you have too many friends Edward complained.",
    "You are a\ndevil Victoria.",
    "I love you madly and you dont care a bit.",
    "Oh yes I do said Victoria.",
    "Just a little bit.",
    "Then hiding her delighted satisfaction she asked Edward is there anyone\ncalled Lefarge connected with the Olive Branch\nLefarge Edward looked doubtful.",
    "No I dont think so.",
    "Or anyone called Anna Scheele\nThis time Edwards reaction was very different.",
    "He caught her arm What\ndo you know about Anna Scheele\nOw Edward let go I dont know anything about her.",
    "I just wanted to\nknow if you did.",
    "Where did you hear about her What made you think this Anna Scheele\nhad anything to do with the Olive Branch\nHas she\nEdward said slowly I dont know.",
    "Its all so  so unclear.",
    "He looked at his\nwatch.",
    "I must go he said.",
    "But weve got to get together Victoria.",
    "Theres a lot I\nwant to know.",
    "That evening Edward and Victoria walked together in the Consulate\ngarden.",
    "The sunset was beautiful but neither of the young people noticed it.",
    "It began simply said Victoria with a man coming into my room at the\nTio Hotel and getting stabbed.",
    "It was not perhaps most peoples idea of a simple beginning.",
    "Edward said\nGetting what\nStabbed said Victoria.",
    "Anyway she added he was dead.",
    "How could he come into your room if he was dead\nOh Edward dont be stupid.",
    "For some mysterious reason Victoria could never tell the truth in a simple\nway.",
    "Her story was uncertain and incomplete and it sounded as if she was telling\na terrible lie.",
    "When she came to the end Edward looked at her doubtfully and said You\ndo feel alright Victoria dont you I mean you havent had a dream or\nanything\nOf course not.",
    "Because I mean it seems such an impossible thing to have happened.",
    "Well it did happen Victoria insisted.",
    "And all that dramatic stuff about world powers and mysterious secrets\nthings like that simply dont happen.",
    "Honest Victoria  are you making this up\nNo cried Victoria annoyed.",
    "And youve come down here looking for someone called Lefarge and\nsomeone called Anna Scheele...",
    "Whom youve heard of Victoria added.",
    "Yes... but I dont know if it means anything.",
    "It was just  odd.",
    "You see\nVictoria Im not as clever as you.",
    "You see things and you understand what those\nthings mean.",
    "I just sort of feel that things are  well  wrong  but I dont know\nwhy.",
    "I feel like that sometimes too said Victoria.",
    "Like seeing Sir Rupert on\nthe balcony of the Tio Hotel.",
    "Whos Sir Rupert\nSir Rupert Crofton Lee.",
    "He was on the plane coming out.",
    "A famous man.",
    "And when I saw him sitting on the balcony at the Tio I had that strange feeling\n\n\flike youve just said that something was wrong but I didnt know what it was.",
    "Rathbone asked him to come and give a talk at the Olive Branch I\nbelieve but he couldnt come.",
    "Well go on about Anna Scheele.",
    "Oh Anna Scheele.",
    "It was one of the girls.",
    "Catherine said Victoria immediately.",
    "I believe it was now I think of it.",
    "Well Catherine said to one of the other\ngirls When Anna Scheele comes we can move forward.",
    "Then well get our\norders from her  and her alone\nThats really important Edward.",
    "Didnt you think it was strange at the\ntime\nNo of course I didnt.",
    "I thought it was just some woman who was coming\nout  perhaps a new boss.",
    "Are you sure youre not imagining all this Victoria\nAs soon as he saw the look his young friend gave him he was immediately\nsorry.",
    "All right all right he said quickly.",
    "Only youll admit the whole story just\ndoesnt seem real.",
    "And you are very good at making things up.",
    "The Bishop of\nLlangow and all that\nOh that was just girlish fun said Victoria.",
    "This is serious.",
    "But look here\nEdward how do you know...\nA call from the balcony interrupted her.",
    "Come in you two  drinks waiting.",
    "Coming called Victoria.",
    "Victoria went to bed that night with strangely mixed feelings.",
    "Her journey\nhad ended  and she had found Edward Then she shuddered.",
    "In spite of\neverything she had a feeling of disappointment.",
    "Words floated through her head.",
    "Something she had meant to ask Edward\nin the garden  but Mrs Clayton had called and it had gone out of her head.",
    "She\nmust remember because it was important something was wrong.",
    "If only she\ncould remember before sleep...\n\n\fVictoria dreamed.",
    "She dreamed of a woman coming towards her along a\nhotel corridor  it was herself  but when the woman got near she saw the face\nwas Catherines.",
    "Edward and Catherine  how silly\nCome with me she said to Edward we will find Mr Lefarge...\nAnd suddenly Edward had gone and she was alone in the dark with evil all\naround her.",
    "And she was holding a brown coat covered with blood.",
    "She was\nrunning in terror down a hotel corridor.",
    "And they were coming after her.",
    "Victoria woke suddenly from her dream her heart beating wildly.",
    "CHAPTER FIFTEEN\nYou found your young man asked Mr Dakin.",
    "Victoria nodded.",
    "Yes and Edward thinks he can get me a job at the Olive\nBranch.",
    "And they know something about Anna Scheele there.",
    "Victoria repeated\nwhat Edward had told her.",
    "Now thats very interesting said Mr Dakin.",
    "Who is Anna Scheele asked Victoria.",
    "Shes secretary to the head of an international bank.",
    "She disappeared in\nLondon about ten days ago.",
    "Is she coming to Baghdad\nIf we can believe this young woman Catherine then yes she is Mr Dakin\nsaid thoughtfully.",
    "Perhaps I can find out more at the Olive Branch.",
    "Perhaps  but be very careful Victoria.",
    "I would prefer not to have your\nbody floating in the river.",
    "Victoria shuddered Like Sir Rupert Crofton Lees That was horrible.",
    "Mrs\nClayton got the awful news at breakfast  thats when we heard it.",
    "A report from\nCairo announcing that the body of Sir Rupert has been taken out of the Nile.",
    "First Carmichael and now Sir Rupert.",
    "All the people who know about this\nbusiness are being killed.",
    "You know that morning when Sir Rupert was here at\nthe hotel there was something strange about him.",
    "In what way  strange\nWell  different.",
    "She shook her head annoyed.",
    "I will remember it\nsometime.",
    "Anyway.",
    "There is something I want to ask you.",
    "Who stabbed\nCarmichael Was it someone who followed him here\nNo said Dakin slowly.",
    "He came in one of those Arab boats  and he\nwasnt followed.",
    "I had someone watching the river.",
    "Then it was someone  in the hotel\nYes I was watching the stairs and no one came up.",
    "Yet all the people in\nthe hotel are unlikely for one very good reason.",
    "What is that\n\n\fCarmichael was on his guard.",
    "He had a very strong instinct for danger.",
    "So\nhe must have been stabbed by someone he trusted.",
    "Somehow Edward had persuaded Dr Rathbone to offer Victoria a very\nlowpaid job.",
    "She spent most of her time typing  or encouraging good feeling\namongst visitors who mostly looked at one another with dislike.",
    "The Olive\nBranch was full of that sort of international peace.",
    "The meetings were held with\norange juice to drink and boring food to go with it.",
    "As far as Victoria could see\neverything was respectable and very dull.",
    "She was now living with some other young female workers in a house by\nthe river.",
    "It seemed to Victoria that Catherine watched her in an unfriendly way it was known that Edward had helped Victoria get her job and several pairs of\njealous eyes looked at her unkindly.",
    "Though the Olive Branch seemed respectable Victoria had a strong feeling\nthat Dr Rathbone was not.",
    "Once or twice she noticed his dark eyes looking at her\nand though she returned her most innocent and sweet expression she felt a\nsudden shock of fear.",
    "She rarely saw Edward since he was always being sent to far off places by\nDr Rathbone  he had only just come back from Iran.",
    "Really thought Victoria I see so little of Edward I might as well have\nstayed in England\nSoon afterwards however Edward brought her some papers.",
    "Dr Rathbone\nwould like these typed at once please Victoria.",
    "A tiny note in Edwards handwriting was pinned to the top sheet.",
    "The Tigris riverbank past the House of King Ali tomorrow morning about\neleven.",
    "The following day was Friday the weekly holiday.",
    "Victoria s spirits rose\nhigh.",
    "She really must get her hair washed.",
    "It really needs it she said aloud.",
    "What did you say Catherine at work on a pile of leaflets raised her head\nsuspiciously from the next table.",
    "Victoria said My hair needs washing.",
    "Most of these hairdressing places\nlook so dirty I dont know where to go.",
    "Yes they are dirty.",
    "But I know a girl who washes hair very well and the\ntowels are clean.",
    "I will take you there.",
    "Thats very kind of you Catherine.",
    "We will go tomorrow.",
    "Thank you said Victoria.",
    "Thats very kind.",
    "But not tomorrow.",
    "CHAPTER SIXTEEN\nThe old car bumped madly over the rough road.",
    "The driver turned and\nsmiled at them.",
    "Where are we going\nTo Babylon said Edward.",
    "Its time we had a day out.",
    "To Babylon cried Victoria.",
    "How lovely.",
    "Really to Babylon\nYes but dont expect too much.",
    "Babylon isnt as impressive as it was.",
    "The road isnt very good is it gasped Victoria bouncing in her seat.",
    "It gets worse later on said Edward.",
    "They bounced along happily.",
    "The dust rose in clouds.",
    "Large lorries full of\nArabs raced along in the middle of the road paying no attention to the other\ndrivers.",
    "They passed walled gardens and groups of women and children and\ndonkeys  and to Victoria it was all delightful.",
    "They reached Babylon in two hours and were happy to get out of the car.",
    "The pile of mud and ruins was a disappointment to Victoria who had expected\ncolumns and arches.",
    "But her disappointment disappeared as their guide led them along the\nProcessional Way to the Ishtar Gate with their pictures of unbelievable animals\nhigh on the walls.",
    "A sudden sense of a grand history came to Victoria and a wish\nto know something about this huge proud city that now lay dead and empty.",
    "After a while they sat down by the Babylonian Lion to eat the picnic lunch\nthat Edward had brought.",
    "The guide moved away smiling and telling them\nfirmly that they must see the museum later.",
    "Must we said Victoria dreamily.",
    "Things in glass cases dont seem real\nsomehow.",
    "I went to the British Museum once.",
    "It was very tiring for the feet.",
    "The past is always boring said Edward.",
    "The futures much more\nimportant.",
    "This isnt boring said Victoria waving a sandwich towards the ruins.",
    "Theres a feeling of of greatness here.",
    "A city of great Kings.",
    "Would you have\nliked to be a King of Babylon Edward\nEdward took a deep breath.",
    "Yes I would.",
    "They understood how to be\nKings in those days Thats why they could rule the world and put everything in\n\n\forder.",
    "How strange thought Victoria to be sitting in the ruins of Babylon talking\nlike this.",
    "The sun was very hot and bright and the ruins were pale and\nshimmering in the heat with a background of dark palm trees.",
    "How very nicely\nEdwards hair grew down with a little curl into his neck Victoria found herself\nthinking.",
    "And what a nice neck  brown from the sun with no marks on it.",
    "Suddenly Victoria sat up straight wildly excited.",
    "Ive just remembered about Sir Rupert Crofton Lee.",
    "Edward looked at her blankly.",
    "He sat in front of me in the plane and I saw it  a boil on his neck.",
    "Why shouldnt he have a boil Painful but lots of people get them.",
    "Yes yes of course.",
    "But the point is that morning on the balcony he didnt\nhave one.",
    "One what\nA boil.",
    "Oh Edward do try and understand In the aeroplane he had a boil\nand on the balcony at the Tio he didnt.",
    "His neck was unmarked.",
    "So you see\nwhat it means  the man at the Tio wasnt Sir Rupert.",
    "She nodded violently.",
    "Edward stared at her.",
    "Youre mad Victoria.",
    "It must have been Sir Rupert.",
    "No.",
    "Dont you see Edward I never looked at him properly only at the\ngeneral effect the hat the cloak the whole appearance.",
    "How easy to copy that\nBut why...\nBecause of Carmichael of course.",
    "Carmichael was coming to Baghdad to\ntell him what he had discovered.",
    "And Carmichael wouldnt be on his guard with\nhim.",
    "Of course  it was the false Rupert Crofton Lee who stabbed Carmichael\nI dont believe a word of it.",
    "Its madness.",
    "Dont forget Sir Rupert was\nkilled too afterwards in Cairo.",
    "Oh Edward how awful I saw it happen.",
    "You saw it happen  Victoria are you completely mad\nNo not at all.",
    "Just listen Edward.",
    "There was a knock on my door  in the\nhotel in Cairo  at least I thought it was on my door and I looked out but it was\n\n\factually next door to mine on Sir Rupert Crofton Lees.",
    "It was one of the air\nhostesses.",
    "She asked him if he could go to the BOAC office.",
    "Dont you see\nEdward It was a trap an impersonator was waiting all ready and as soon as Sir\nRupert went into the office they hit him on the head and the other man came out\nand took his place.",
    "They killed the real Sir Rupert when the impersonator came\nback to Cairo.",
    "Its a wonderful story said Edward.",
    "But you know Victoria there is no\nevidence.",
    "Theres the boil...\nOh forget the boil\nAnd there are one or two other things.",
    "What\nThe BOAC notice on the door.",
    "It wasnt there later.",
    "I remembered being\nsurprised when I found the BOAC office was on the other side of the building.",
    "And the air stewardess.",
    "Ive seen her since  here in Baghdad  at the Olive\nBranch.",
    "The first day I went there.",
    "She came in and spoke to Catherine.",
    "I thought\nthen that Id seen her before.",
    "After a silence Edward said slowly It all comes back to the Olive Branch\n and to Catherine.",
    "Victoria youve got to get closer to Catherine.",
    "Be nice to her.",
    "Somehow or other get to know who her friends are and where she goes and who\nshe meets outside the Olive Branch.",
    "What about Mr Dakin asked Victoria.",
    "Ought I to tell him about this\nYes of course.",
    "But wait a day or two.",
    "We may have a lot more to tell him.",
    "Excited by her discoveries Victoria found it easy to speak to Catherine\nkindly the following day.",
    "When they left the Olive Branch together that evening\nthe two girls were much more like friends.",
    "Catherine led her in and out of\nnarrow alleys and finally knocked on a door where a young woman welcomed\nthem in English.",
    "She invited Victoria to sit by a clean basin with shining taps\nand bottles of shampoo placed round it.",
    "Catherine left and Victoria relaxed in the\ncare of an expert hairdresser.",
    "Soon her hair was covered in lovely creamy\nshampoo.",
    "And now please... said the young hairdresser.",
    "Victoria moved her head over the basin.",
    "Water flowed over her hair and\nsuddenly there was a sweet sickly hospital smell.",
    "A wet cloth was pressed over\nher nose and mouth.",
    "She fought wildly but her thoughts were losing focus a\nloud noise filled her ears...\nThen blackness.",
    "CHAPTER SEVENTEEN\nVictoria woke with confused memories  a bumping car  Arabs arguing  a\nhorrible feeling that she would be sick  then she remembered lying on a bed and\nan injection  then more darkness.",
    "Something had happened  that horrible smell  chloroform of course.",
    "And\nthen a sleeping drug.",
    "Well they hadnt killed her.",
    "So that was all right.",
    "She was lying on a hard\nbed in a small room with a floor of hard earth.",
    "There was an old table with a\nbasin on it and a bucket underneath it  and a window with wooden bars outside.",
    "Victoria got off the bed slowly feeling headachy and went to the window.",
    "She could see through the bars into a garden with palm trees beyond it.",
    "She\nturned to the door which was large and locked.",
    "She went back and sat on the bed.",
    "Where was she Not in Baghdad that was certain.",
    "And what was she\ngoing to do next Even more important what was someone going to do to her\nShe heard footsteps and then there was the noise of a very large key in an\nold lock.",
    "The door opened slowly.",
    "An Arab carried in a tray.",
    "He spoke some Arabic put down the tray and left locking the door behind\nhim.",
    "On the tray was a large bowl of rice some cabbage leaves and a big piece\nof Arab bread  also a jug of water and a glass.",
    "Victoria drank some water and then started eating hungrily.",
    "When she had\nfinished everything she felt much better.",
    "She also felt that it would be much better if by tomorrow she was\nsomewhere else.",
    "But was that possible She went to examine the door but there\nwas nothing she could do.",
    "This wasnt the kind of lock you could open easily.",
    "The window  she could break the wooden bars.",
    "But the noise would\nattract attention.",
    "Damn.",
    "said Victoria.",
    "She approached the old table for another drink of water  and some fell on\nthe floor.",
    "At once it turned into mud.",
    "An idea formed in Miss Victoria Jones\nalways active brain.",
    "The sun was setting.",
    "Very soon it would be dark.",
    "What she needed was\nsomething to push with.",
    "She looked round.",
    "On the table was a large spoon.",
    "That\nmight be useful.",
    "She went back to the door and pushed vigorously through the\nlarge keyhole until the key fell out.",
    "Now Victoria thought I must hurry before the light goes completely.",
    "She picked up the jug of water and poured some at the bottom of the door near\nwhere she thought the key had fallen on the other side.",
    "Then using the spoon\nshe began to dig out the wet part.",
    "Little by little pouring more water she dug a\nhole under the door.",
    "Lying down she could get her arm through it.",
    "She felt about\nand found the key pulling it back to her side of the door.",
    "Holding the key in her muddy hand Victoria waited until some dogs\nstarted barking loudly then she turned the key in the lock.",
    "The door opened\nshowing her another room  with an open door at the other end.",
    "It led out to the\ngarden.",
    "A piece of ragged black material lay near the outside door.",
    "It was an old\naba the large loose dress that Arab women wore.",
    "It would be useful for\ncovering her Western clothes.",
    "Victoria would wait until the village went to sleep\nand then she would go.",
    "It seemed to Victoria that she waited for hours but at last the human noises\nstopped.",
    "She heard only the distant barking of dogs.",
    "The moon was low in the\nsky.",
    "It gave enough light to see her way to the opening in the mud wall around\nthe garden.",
    "She walked quickly through some trees and came out into an alley\nbetween mudbrick walls.",
    "Victoria ran along it as fast as she could.",
    "Now dogs began to bark loudly.",
    "Victoria turned a corner and came into the\nmain street.",
    "Narrow and rough it ran through a village of mudbrick houses all\npale in the moonlight.",
    "Palms hung over walls dogs barked.",
    "Victoria ran.",
    "Soon she came out to a muddy river with an old stone bridge over it  and a\ntrack heading out into the desert.",
    "Victoria ran until she was out of breath.",
    "The village was far behind her now.",
    "The moon was high.",
    "To her left and\nright and front was open stony ground without any sign of people.",
    "And Victoria\nhad no idea in what direction the track led.",
    "But it was impossible to turn back.",
    "She started walking towards the unknown.",
    "Morning came at last.",
    "Victoria was exhausted and her feet were sore.",
    "She\n\n\fsaw that she was heading southwest and to the side of the road ahead of her was\na low flattopped hill.",
    "Victoria left the track and went towards it climbing to the\ntop.",
    "With a feeling of panic she looked at the country all around.",
    "Everywhere\nthere was nothing.",
    "The scene was beautiful in the early morning light.",
    "The\nground and horizon were coloured with faint shades of orange and cream on\nwhich were patterns of shadows.",
    "It was beautiful but frightening.",
    "I know what it means now thought Victoria when someone says they are\nalone in the world.",
    "Suddenly she heard a car.",
    "It was coming towards the village  so it was not\nsomeone chasing her.",
    "It was still only a small black dot far off on the track.",
    "But suppose this was the enemy\nVictoria went down the hill as quickly as she could and then lay down.",
    "She\nwatched the car come nearer.",
    "There was an Arab driver and beside him a man in\nEuropean clothes.",
    "Now thought Victoria Ive got to decide.",
    "Should she stop the car\nHow could she be sure The track was deserted.",
    "Nothing had passed  not\neven a donkey.",
    "Perhaps this car was going to the village she had left last night\nIf it was the enemy it was the end.",
    "But it might be her only hope of\nsurvival.",
    "What should she do\nAs she lay there considering the car slowed then it came off the road\ntowards the hill.",
    "It had seen her\nVictoria crawled round the back of the hill.",
    "She heard the car stop and the\nbang of a door.",
    "Then somebody said something in Arabic.",
    "Suddenly a man came\ninto view.",
    "He was walking round the hill halfway up.",
    "His eyes were on the\nground and from time to time he bent down and picked something up.",
    "Whatever\nhe was looking for it was not a girl called Victoria Jones.",
    "And even better he\nwas definitely an Englishman.",
    "With a cry of relief Victoria stood up.",
    "He lifted his head and looked at her\n\n\fin surprise.",
    "Im so glad youve come.",
    "said Victoria.",
    "He still stared.",
    "Who on earth... he began.",
    "Are you English But...\nWith a little laugh Victoria threw off the old aba.",
    "Of course Im English she said.",
    "And please can you take me back to\nBaghdad\nIm not going to Baghdad.",
    "Ive just come from there.",
    "What on earth are\nyou doing alone out here in the middle of the desert\nI was kidnapped said Victoria quickly.",
    "I went to have my hair\nshampooed and they gave me chloroform.",
    "And when I woke up I was in an\nArab house in a village over there.",
    "She pointed towards the horizon.",
    "In Mandali\nI dont know its name.",
    "I escaped and walked all through the night and then\nI hid behind this hill in case you were an enemy.",
    "Her rescuer was staring at her with a very strange expression.",
    "He was a\nman of about thirtyfive fairhaired with a sort of superior expression.",
    "He was\nvery polite and correct.",
    "He now put on a pair of glasses and stared at her through\nthem in a very superior way.",
    "Victoria decided that this man did not believe a.\nword she was saying.",
    "She was immediately extremely angry.",
    "Its perfectly true she said.",
    "Every word of it\nThe stranger looked more disbelieving than ever.",
    "Incredible he said\ncoldly.",
    "Victoria was frustrated.",
    "How unfair it was that she could always make a lie\nsound believable but when telling the truth she didnt have the power to make\npeople believe her.",
    "Well if you havent got anything to drink with you I shall die of thirst\nshe said.",
    "Abdul the stranger called.",
    "Sahib\n\n\fThe driver appeared and was sent for a large bottle of water.",
    "Victoria drank\nthankfully.",
    "Oh she said.",
    "Thats better.",
    "My names Richard Baker said the Englishman.",
    "Im Victoria Jones.",
    "And then in an effort to change the disbelief she saw\ninto respectful attention she added Im joining my uncle Dr Pauncefoot Jones\non his dig.",
    "How amazing said Baker.",
    "Im on my way to the dig myself.",
    "Its only\nabout fifteen miles from here.",
    "Im just the right person to have rescued you\narent I\nVictoria was completely shocked  quite unable to say another word.",
    "Silently she followed Richard to the car.",
    "I suppose youre the anthropologist.",
    "said Richard as she sat down in the\nback seat.",
    "I didnt expect you so soon.",
    "He stood for a moment sorting through various pieces of broken pottery\nwhich he removed from his pockets.",
    "Victoria now realized that this was what he\nhad been picking up on the hill.",
    "Most of it is late Assyrian he said pointing towards the hill.",
    "He smiled as\nhe added Im glad to see that in spite of your troubles your archaeological\ninstincts led you to examine a tell.",
    "Victoria opened her mouth and then shut it again.",
    "What after all could she say\nFortunately for a short time she had been a typist at the Archaeological\nInstitute in London.",
    "So at least she knew that a tell was a hill made by people\nrebuilding their houses again and again in the same place.",
    "They just levelled the\nruins of old buildings and built on top of them.",
    "Over time this made a special\nkind of hill.",
    "So when people like Richard Baker dug into a tell the deeper they\ndug the older the buildings they discovered.",
    "It was also true that he would discover she was a liar as soon as they\nreached the dig.",
    "But it would be much much better to be sorry there than to\nconfess the truth to Mr Richard Baker in the middle of nowhere.",
    "And anyway\nthought Victoria perhaps before I get there I will have thought of something.",
    "Her busy imagination got to work immediately.",
    "After a while Mr Baker said something to Abdul and the car turned off the\n\n\ftrack and into the desert.",
    "With nothing to guide him as far as Victoria could see\nRichard Baker directed Abdul.",
    "Soon Richard said with satisfaction Going the\nright way now.",
    "Victoria could not see any way at all.",
    "But sometimes she saw vague tyre\nmarks.",
    "Then they crossed a slightly clearer collection of tyre marks and Richard\ncalled out for Abdul to stop.",
    "Heres an interesting sight for you he said to Victoria.",
    "Two men were coming towards them.",
    "One man carried a short wooden\nseat the other a big round wooden object.",
    "They welcomed Richard warmly.",
    "He produced cigarettes and soon a party\natmosphere developed.",
    "Then Richard turned to her.",
    "Do you like the cinema Then you shall see a\nperformance.",
    "He spoke to the men and they smiled with pleasure.",
    "They set up the seat\nfor Victoria and Richard to sit on.",
    "Then they set up the round wooden box on a\nstand.",
    "It had two little holes covered with glass and as Victoria put her eyes to\nthem one man began to turn a handle and the other began to sing.",
    "Richard translated Come near and prepare yourself for much delight.",
    "Prepare to see ancient wonders.",
    "Victoria could see a coloured picture.",
    "The wife of the great Shah of the\nWestern world said Richard.",
    "Then the Empress Eugenie touched one of her\nlong curls next came a picture of the Kings Palace in Montenegro another of\nthe Great Exhibition.",
    "A strange collection of pictures followed all different and\nsometimes announced with the strangest of descriptions.",
    "People skating on ice\ncompleted this strange collection of old photographs.",
    "When the show ended Victoria smiled with pleasure.",
    "That was\nmarvellous\nThe owners of the travelling cinema smiled proudly.",
    "Richard gave them\nsome money.",
    "Richard and Victoria got into the car and calling goodbye to them\nthe men walked away into the desert.",
    "Where are they going asked Victoria.",
    "To Kerbela but they travel all over the country.",
    "I first met them coming up\nthe road from the Dead Sea.",
    "The car still appeared to be going nowhere with complete confidence.",
    "Where are we going Victoria asked.",
    "To the dig at Tell Aswad.",
    "Youll see it soon.",
    "But now look over to your\nleft.",
    "Are they clouds asked Victoria.",
    "They cant be mountains.",
    "Ah but they are.",
    "The snowcovered mountains of Kurdistan.",
    "A great feeling of contentment came over Victoria.",
    "If only she could drive\non like this forever.",
    "If only she wasnt such a terrible liar.",
    "She felt as nervous as a\nchild at the thought of the unpleasant meeting ahead.",
    "There you are said Richard.",
    "Victoria could just see a small shape on the far horizon.",
    "The small shape\ndeveloped very quickly into a very large tell.",
    "On one side of this great hill was a\nlong low building of mudbrick.",
    "This is where we archaeologists stay said Richard.",
    "They stopped the car in the middle of a group of barking dogs.",
    "Servants in\nwhite clothes rushed out with welcoming smiles.",
    "After an exchange of greetings in Arabic Richard explained They werent\nexpecting you so soon.",
    "But theyll get your bed ready.",
    "And bring you some hot\nwater.",
    "I expect youd like to have a wash and a rest Dr Pauncefoot Jones is up\non the tell.",
    "Im going up to him.",
    "Ibrahim will look after you.",
    "He walked away and Victoria followed Ibrahim into the house.",
    "It seemed\ndark at first coming in out of the sun.",
    "They passed through a livingroom with\nsome big tables and a few old armchairs then round a courtyard and into a small\nroom with one window.",
    "There was a bed a chest of drawers a chair and a table\nwith a jug and basin on it.",
    "Ibrahim smiling and nodding brought her a large jug\nof hot water a towel and a small mirror which he fixed to a nail on the wall.",
    "Victoria was beginning to think how tired she was and how very dirty.",
    "I suppose I look terrible she said to herself and went to the mirror.",
    "For some moments she stared at her reflection without understanding.",
    "This was not Victoria Jones.",
    "Though her features were the small neat features of Victoria Jones her hair\nwas now platinum blonde\n\n\f\fCHAPTER EIGHT\nRichard found Dr Pauncefoot Jones at the dig on his knees carefully using\na small tool on a length of wall.",
    "Hello Richard my boy.",
    "I thought you were arriving on Tuesday.",
    "This is Tuesday said Richard.",
    "Is it really now said Dr Pauncefoot Jones without interest.",
    "Just come\ndown here and see what you think of this.",
    "Perfectly good walls are coming out\nalready and were only down three feet.",
    "It looks very promising.",
    "Richard jumped down into the long hole and the two archaeologists\nenjoyed themselves in a highly technical manner for a quarter of an hour.",
    "By the way said Richard Ive brought a girl.",
    "Says shes your niece.",
    "With an effort Dr Pauncefoot Jones brought his mind back from mudbrick\nwalls.",
    "I dont think I have a niece he said doubtfully.",
    "Shes coming to work here I understand.",
    "Oh.",
    "Dr Pauncefoot Jones face relaxed.",
    "Of course.",
    "That will be Venetia.",
    "Victoria she said.",
    "Yes yes Victoria.",
    "A very able girl I understand.",
    "An anthropologist.",
    "Theres nothing for her yet.",
    "Of course were only just beginning.",
    "Actually I\nunderstood she wasnt coming for another two weeks but I didnt read her letter\nvery carefully and then I lost it.",
    "My wife arrives next week  or the week after and I thought Venetia was coming out with her.",
    "Well well I am sure we can\nmake her useful.",
    "Theres a lot of pottery coming up.",
    "Theres nothing strange about her is there\nStrange Dr Pauncefoot Jones looked closely at him.",
    "In what way\nWell she told me the most extraordinary story.",
    "She said shed gone to have\nher hair shampooed and they chloroformed her and carried her off to Mandali\nand imprisoned her and shed escaped in the middle of the night  the silliest\nnonsense you ever heard.",
    "Shes obviously one of those very emotional girls.",
    "Oh I expect shell calm down said Dr Pauncefoot Jones without concern.",
    "Where is she now\n\n\fI left her to have a wash.",
    "He hesitated.",
    "She hasnt got any luggage with\nher.",
    "Hasnt she That is difficult.",
    "You dont think shell expect me to lend her\npyjamas Ive only got two pairs and one of them is torn.",
    "Victoria waiting nervously saw that Dr Pauncefoot Jones was a small\nround man with a twinkle in his eye.",
    "To her confusion he came towards her with\nopen arms.",
    "Well well Venetia  I mean Victoria.",
    "This is a surprise.",
    "I didnt think you\nwere arriving until next month.",
    "But Im delighted to see you.",
    "Delighted.",
    "Victoria recovered quickly which wasnt easy.",
    "Richard tells me your luggage is lost said Dr Pauncefoot Jones.",
    "How are\nyou going to manage We cant send the lorry in to town before next week\nI can manage said Victoria smiling.",
    "No signs of any human bones for you Dr Pauncefoot Jones warned her.",
    "Some nice walls are coming up  and lots of pottery.",
    "Well keep you busy.",
    "I\nforget if you do photography\nI know something about it said Victoria happy at the mention of\nsomething that she did in fact know how to do.",
    "Good good.",
    "Thats a help.",
    "Though the laboratory is rather basic.",
    "I dont mind said Victoria.",
    "She was still trying to understand it all.",
    "Clearly he thought she was an\nanthropologist called Venetia who was joining the expedition.",
    "Very well then\nuntil the lorry went into Baghdad Victoria would try to be Venetia.",
    "But she\nwould have to be very careful.",
    "Luckily thought Victoria men were always so\nsuperior about women that any mistake she made would be treated as proof of\nhow silly women were\nAnd spending time here would give her a rest which she very much\nneeded.",
    "She had hated the horrible fight against the chloroform and she had\nbeen very frightened waking up in that room.",
    "Here she would be well hidden.",
    "Richards car had not passed through Mandali so nobody could guess she was\nnow at Tell Aswad.",
    "No from the enemy point of view Victoria would have\ndisappeared.",
    "They might decide that she had got lost in the desert and died.",
    "Well let them think so.",
    "Unhappily of course Edward would think so too\nVery well Edward must suffer.",
    "In fact he would not have to suffer long before\nshe was back from the dead  only as a blonde instead of a brunette.",
    "And that brought her back to the mystery of why they  whoever they were\n had dyed her hair.",
    "There must be some reason.",
    "Never mind thought Victoria Im alive.",
    "And I will enjoy myself for a\nweek.",
    "It will be great fun to be on an archaeological dig and see what it is like.",
    "She did not find it easy.",
    "The names of people of publications the styles of\narchitecture and types of pottery had to be treated carefully.",
    "Fortunately a good\nlistener is always popular.",
    "Victoria was an excellent listener and she began to\nlearn the technical language.",
    "She read all the time she was alone in the house.",
    "There was a good library\nof archaeological books and magazines.",
    "And unexpectedly she found the life\nvery enjoyable.",
    "Tea was brought to her in the early morning then she went out\non the dig to help Richard with camera work.",
    "To put pottery back together.",
    "To\nwatch as the walls of a palace were slowly dug out.",
    "To see how carefully the\nmen worked.",
    "Richard Baker still looked at her thoughtfully sometimes but he was\nfriendly and amused by her enthusiasm.",
    "Its all new to you he said one day.",
    "I remember how excited I was my\nfirst season.",
    "How long ago was that\nHe smiled.",
    "Rather a long time ago  fifteen years.",
    "You talk Arabic very well.",
    "If you were dressed as one could you pass as\nan Arab\nHe shook his head.",
    "Oh no The only man I know who could pass as one is\na man who was actually born here.",
    "His father was Consul in lots of wild places.",
    "We were at school together.",
    "In fact I saw him only the other day at Basrah.",
    "First\ntime in years  and in rather strange circumstances.",
    "Strange\nYes.",
    "I didnt recognize him.",
    "He was dressed as an Arab with a string of\nthose beads they carry and he started making little clicking noises with it  only\nyou see he was actually using Morse code.",
    "He was clicking out a message  to\n\n\fme\nWhat did it say\nMy school nickname and his then he made a signal to expect trouble.",
    "And was there trouble\nYes.",
    "An Englishman with a gun.",
    "I knocked his arm up  and Carmichael\ngot away.",
    "Carmichael\nHe turned his head quickly.",
    "Do you know him\nYes she said.",
    "I knew him.",
    "Knew him Why  is he...\nVictoria nodded.",
    "Yes.",
    "Hes dead.",
    "He was killed in Baghdad.",
    "In the Tio\nHotel.",
    "It was kept quiet.",
    "Nobody knows.",
    "He nodded slowly.",
    "I see.",
    "It was that kind of business.",
    "But you...",
    "He\nlooked at her.",
    "How did you know\nI got mixed up in it  by accident.",
    "He gave her a long considering look.",
    "Victoria asked suddenly Your nickname at school wasnt Lucifer was it\nHe looked surprised.",
    "Lucifer no I was Owl  because I had to wear\nglasses.",
    "You dont know anyone who is called Lucifer  in Basrah Richard shook\nhis head.",
    "Lucifer Son of the Morning  the fallen angel.",
    "He watched her closely\nas he spoke but Victoria was frowning.",
    "Where were you when all this happened at Basrah she asked.",
    "It was in the waiting room of the Consulate.",
    "There were a couple of others\nand this Englishman and Carmichael.",
    "And you stopped the man with the gun and Carmichael got out  how\nHe turned first towards the Consuls office.",
    "Its at the other end of a\npassage with a garden...\nShe interrupted.",
    "I know.",
    "I stayed there for a day or two.",
    "Once again he watched her closely  but Victoria didnt notice.",
    "She was\nseeing the long passage at the Consulate with the door opening on to green trees\nand sunlight.",
    "Well Carmichael went that way first.",
    "Then he turned and ran the other\nway into the street.",
    "What about the Englishman\nRichard shook his head.",
    "He told some story about having been robbed by\nan Arab.",
    "I didnt hear any more because I flew on to Kuwait.",
    "Who was staying at the Consulate just then Victoria asked.",
    "A man called Crosbie  one of the oil people.",
    "Oh yes I believe there was\nsomeone else from Baghdad but I didnt meet him.",
    "I cant remember his name.",
    "Victoria remembered Captain Crosbie  and that he had been back in\nBaghdad the night Carmichael came to the Tio Hotel.",
    "Could Carmichael have\nseen Crosbie at the end of the passage standing against the sunlight Was that\nwhy he had turned and run towards the street instead of trying to reach the\nConsul Generals office\nShe jumped rather guiltily when she looked up to find Richard Baker\nwatching her closely.",
    "Any more questions\nDo you know anybody called Lefarge Victoria asked.",
    "No.",
    "Man or woman\nI dont know.",
    "She was wondering about Crosbie.",
    "Was Crosbie Lucifer\n\n\fCHAPTER NINETEEN\nThe night before the lorry was going to take them into Baghdad Richard\nfound Victoria alone in the living room sitting with a book.",
    "What are you reading\nYou dont have much fiction here.",
    "Its A Tale of Two Cities.",
    "I always\nthought Dickens would be boring.",
    "But Im finding it most exciting.",
    "Where have you got to He looked over her shoulder and read out And\nthe knitting women count one.",
    "I think shes very frightening said Victoria.",
    "Madame Defarge Yes.",
    "Though I have always doubted that you could\nwork a list of names into your knitting.",
    "But then I cant knit.",
    "Oh I think you could said Victoria considering how she would manage it\nby making lots of deliberate mistakes with the stitches.",
    "Yes it could be done.",
    "Suddenly two things came together in her mind with the force of an\nexplosion.",
    "The man with the handknitted red scarf and that name Lefarge.",
    "Not Lefarge.",
    "Carmichael had not said Lefarge.",
    "It was Defarge And of\ncourse he meant Madame Defarge.",
    "She was brought back to reality by Richard saying Is anything wrong\nNo  no that is I just thought of something.",
    "I see.",
    "Richard raised his eyebrows in his most superior way.",
    "Your last\nname perhaps\nI know my own name Victoria said annoyed.",
    "Thats not quite true said Richard smiling.",
    "Its no good Victoria.",
    "Youve\nbeen very clever.",
    "Youve studied your subject and you know something about it but Ive laid traps for you.",
    "Ive said some completely ridiculous things about\narchaeology and youve accepted them.",
    "He paused.",
    "Youre not Venetia Savile.",
    "Who are you\nI told you the first time I met you said Victoria.",
    "Im Victoria Jones.",
    "Dr Pauncefoot Jones niece\nNo  but my name is Jones.",
    "You told me a lot of other things.",
    "Yes I did.",
    "And they were all true But you didnt believe me.",
    "And that\nmade me mad because though I do tell lies  what I told you then wasnt a lie.",
    "And so I said my name was Pauncefoot Jones  Ive said that before out here and\nits always worked very well.",
    "How could I have known you were actually\ncoming to this place\nIt must have been a shock said Richard seriously.",
    "But you did very well.",
    "Inside I was absolutely terrified said Victoria.",
    "But I felt that if I waited\nuntil I got here to explain at least I would be safe.Safe Look here Victoria\nwas that wild story you told me about being chloroformed really true\nOf course it was true If I wanted to invent a story I could make up a\nmuch better one than that and tell it better\nKnowing you as I do now I can see that\nSo why are you willing to think its possible now\nRichard said slowly Because if as you say you were mixed up in\nCarmichaels death  well then it might be true.",
    "Thats how it all began said Victoria.",
    "She told him of the night of Carmichaels death of her talk with Mr Dakin\nof her journey to Basrah of her job in the Olive Branch of Catherines dislike of\nDr Rathbone and the very strange business of the dyed hair.",
    "The only things she\nleft out were the red scarf and Madame Defarge.",
    "Richard sat back and looked at her.",
    "Is this real Are you real And are you\nthe heroine in danger or the evil adventurer Victoria said in a practical manner\nThe real point is what are we going to say to Dr Pauncefoot Jones about me\nNothing said Richard.",
    "CHAPTER TWENTY\nVictoria Richard and Dr Pauncefoot Jones started for Baghdad early.",
    "It\ntook nearly three uncomfortable hours in the bumping lorry before it left them at\nthe Tio Hotel.",
    "A lot of mail was waiting for Dr Pauncefoot Jones and Richard.",
    "Marcus appeared smiling his usual friendly welcome for Victoria.",
    "You do\nnot come to my hotel for two weeks.",
    "Why is that You lunch here today\nClearly the kidnapping of Victoria had not been noticed.",
    "Possibly Edward\nhad not been to the police.",
    "Is Mr Dakin in Baghdad do you know Marcus she asked.",
    "Mr Dakin  ah yes very nice man  of course he is a friend of yours.",
    "He\nwas here yesterday.",
    "Do you know where his office is\nSure I know.",
    "Everybody knows the Iraqi Iranian Oil Company.",
    "Well I want to go there now.",
    "In a taxi.",
    "Marcus immediately shouted at a servant to get a taxi.",
    "Then Marcus took\nVictoria out and instructed the driver.",
    "And can I have a room Victoria asked.",
    "Yes yes.",
    "I can give you a beautiful room and I order you a big steak  very\nspecial.",
    "And before that we can have a little drink.",
    "Lovely said Victoria.",
    "Oh Marcus can you lend me some money\nOf course my dear.",
    "Here you are.",
    "The taxi started off suddenly with a noisy honk of its horn and Victoria fell\nback on the seat holding coins and notes.",
    "Five minutes later Victoria entered the offices of the Iraqi Iranian Oil\nCompany.",
    "Mr Dakin rose from his desk and shook her hand as she was shown in.",
    "Miss  er  Miss Jones isnt it Bring coffee Abdullah.",
    "As the door closed\nbehind the clerk Victoria said quietly Theres something Ive got to tell you at\nonce  before anything more happens to me.",
    "Happens to you Has anything happened to you\nDont you know asked Victoria.",
    "Hasnt Edward told you\n\n\fNo.",
    "That jealous Catherine\nPardon\nI bet she told Edward some silly story and the idiot believed her.",
    "Well lets hear about it said Mr Dakin.",
    "Er  if I may say so his eye went\nto Victorias blonde head I prefer you as a brunette.",
    "Thats only part of it said Victoria.",
    "There was a knock at the door and Abdullah entered with little cups of\nsweet coffee.",
    "When he had gone Victoria began the story of her adventures.",
    "She\nfinished by telling him about the red scarf Carmichael had dropped and how she\nconnected it with Madame Defarge  and the idea that a message was knitted into\nthe scarf.",
    "I think said Dakin his eyes shining with excitement that this is the first\nreal success weve had.",
    "Where is the scarf\nWith the rest of my things  when I packed I put everything in.",
    "And you never mentioned to anyone that that scarf belonged to\nCarmichael\nNo Id forgotten about it.",
    "Then it ought to be all right.",
    "Even if theyve searched your things they\nwont have seen any importance in an old scarf.",
    "All weve got to do is have your\nthings collected.",
    "Ive booked a room at the Tio  but do you want me to go back to the Olive\nBranch\nDakin looked at her with interest.",
    "Are you scared\nVictoria lifted her head.",
    "She had to earn her pay and show a brave face Ill\ngo if you like she said with a determination she did not feel.",
    "No.",
    "Someone learned why you were there.",
    "Youd better stay away.",
    "He\nsmiled.",
    "Otherwise you may be a redhead next time I see you.",
    "Thats what I want to know most of all cried Victoria.",
    "Why did they dye\nmy hair I cant see any reason.",
    "Can you\n\n\fOnly so your dead body might be less easy to identify.",
    "But if they wanted me dead why didnt they kill me immediately\nThats the question I wish we could answer most of all Victoria.",
    "And I\nhavent got a clue.",
    "Talking of clues said Victoria do you remember my saying that there\nwas something about Sir Rupert Crofton Lee that didnt seem right that morning\nat the Tio\nYes.",
    "You didnt know him personally did you\nNo.",
    "I thought not.",
    "Because you see the man you met wasnt Sir Rupert\nCrofton Lee.",
    "And she began another story starting with the boil on Sir Ruperts neck.",
    "So that was how it was done said Dakin.",
    "Carmichael got safely to\nCrofton Lee but it was the Crofton Lee impersonator who stabbed him.",
    "Victoria\nI want you to write to Edward now.",
    "Say youre at the Tio and ask him to bring\nyour luggage.",
    "Im going to see Dr Rathbone this morning about one of his\nmeetings.",
    "It will be easy for me to quietly pass a note to his secretary personally\n so there will be no danger of your enemy Catherine losing it.",
    "CHAPTER TWENTY ONE\nVictoria sat on the balcony of the Tio Hotel once more in the role of a\nmodern Juliet waiting for Romeo.",
    "And soon enough Romeo appeared below\nlooking around.",
    "Edward Victoria called.",
    "Edward looked up.",
    "Oh there you are\nA moment later he came out upon the balcony  and stared at her in a\npuzzled way.",
    "I say Victoria havent you done something to your hair\nVictoria gave a troubled sigh.",
    "I liked it better as it was said Edward.",
    "Tell Catherine so\nCatherine What has she got to do with it\nEverything said Victoria.",
    "You told me to make friends with her and I\ndid and I dont suppose youve any idea what trouble it got me into\nWell Catherine said youd told her to tell me that youd gone off to Mosul.",
    "It was very important and good news and I would hear from you as soon as you\ncould manage.",
    "And you believed that said Victoria.",
    "How could he be so silly You\ndidnt think that Catherine might be lying and that Id been knocked on the\nhead.",
    "What Edward stared.",
    "Chloroformed.",
    "Good Lord Edward looked quickly around.",
    "I dont think we should talk\nout here.",
    "Cant we go to your room\nAll right.",
    "Did you bring my luggage\nYes I left it with the porter.",
    "Because I havent had a change of clothes for two weeks...\nVictoria what has been happening I know  Ive got the car here.",
    "Lets go\nout to Devonshire.",
    "Devonshire Victoria stared in surprise.",
    "Oh its just a name for a place not far out of Baghdad.",
    "Its lovely this time\nof year.",
    "Come on.",
    "I havent been alone with you for so long.",
    "They ran down the stairs and out to where Edwards car was parked.",
    "Edward drove south along a wide road.",
    "Then he turned off and they bumped\nthrough the fields of palm trees and over little bridges.",
    "Finally they came to\nsome fruit trees which were just beginning to flower.",
    "It was beautiful  and\nbeyond the woods was the Tigris.",
    "They got out and walked through the flowering trees.",
    "This is lovely said Victoria sighing deeply.",
    "The air was soft and warm.",
    "After a while they sat down on a fallen tree\nwith pink flowers above their heads.",
    "Now darling said Edward.",
    "Tell me whats been happening to you.",
    "Ive\nbeen so horribly miserable.",
    "Have you she smiled dreamily.",
    "Then she told him.",
    "Of the hairdresser the chloroform  and waking up.",
    "Of\nhow she had escaped and her lucky meeting with Richard Baker and pretending\nto be an anthropologist arriving from England.",
    "At this point Edward shouted with laughter.",
    "You are marvellous Victoria The things you think of and invent.",
    "I know said Victoria.",
    "My uncles Dr Pauncefoot Jones and before him the Bishop.",
    "And she suddenly remembered what she had been going to ask Edward at\nBasrah when Mrs Clayton had called them in for drinks.",
    "I meant to ask you before she said.",
    "How did you know about the\nBishop\nShe felt his hand go tense.",
    "He said quickly Why you told me didnt you\nIt was strange Victoria thought afterwards that one silly mistake should\nhave done what it did.",
    "For he was taken by surprise he had no story ready  his\nface was suddenly unguarded and his hidden lies were so easy to read.",
    "As she looked at him everything changed and she saw the truth.",
    "Perhaps it\nwas not really sudden.",
    "Perhaps pushed deep down in her mind beneath all the\nexcitement and glamour the question had been worrying her  How did Edward\n\n\fknow about the Bishop\nAnd she had been slowly arriving at the only answer  Edward had not\nlearned about the Bishop of Llangow from her.",
    "And the only other person he\ncould have learned it from was Mr or Mrs Hamilton Clipp.",
    "But they had not seen\nEdward since her arrival in Baghdad because Edward had been in Basrah so he\nmust have learned it from them before he left England.",
    "He must have known all\nthe time that Victoria was coming out to Baghdad with them  and the whole\nwonderful coincidence was not after all a coincidence.",
    "It had been planned.",
    "And as she stared at Edwards face she knew suddenly what Carmichael\nhad meant by Lucifer.",
    "She knew what he had seen that day as he looked along\nthe passage to the Consulate garden.",
    "He had seen that young beautiful face that\nshe was looking at now  for it was beautiful just like Lucifer Son of the\nMorning was also beautiful.",
    "Not Dr Rathbone  it had been Edward Edward playing the part of the\nsecretary but controlling and planning and directing everything using Rathbone\nas a coverup.",
    "As she looked at that beautiful evil face all her silly childish love slowly\ndisappeared and she knew that what she felt for Edward had never been love.",
    "It\nhad been attraction and excitement.",
    "And Edward had never loved her.",
    "He had\nused his charm deliberately.",
    "He had chatted to her that day using his charm so\neasily so naturally that she had believed him immediately.",
    "She had been a fool.",
    "It was extraordinary how much could flash through your mind in just a few\nseconds.",
    "You didnt have to think about it.",
    "It just came.",
    "Full and immediate\nknowledge.",
    "Perhaps because really underneath you had known it all along...",
    "Suddenly Victoria knew instinctively that she was in great danger.",
    "There\nwas only one thing that could save her only one thing she could say.",
    "You knew\nall the time that I was coming out here You must have arranged it.",
    "Oh Edward\nyou are wonderful\nHer face showed one emotion  adoration.",
    "And she saw the scorn the\nrelief.",
    "She could almost feel Edward saying to himself The little fool Shell\nbelieve anything I can do what I like with her.",
    "But how did you arrange it she said.",
    "You must be very powerful.",
    "You\nmust be quite different from what you pretend to be.",
    "Youre  youre like a King\n\n\fof Babylon.",
    "She saw the pride in his face.",
    "She saw the power and strength and beauty\nand cruelty that had been hidden behind his mask of a modest likeable young\nman.",
    "She said quickly and anxiously as a final artistic touch But you do love\nme dont you\nHis scorn was clear to see now.",
    "This little fool  all women were fools It\nwas so easy to make them think you loved them and that was all they cared\nabout They had no idea of greatness of a new world they just wanted love\nThey were slaves and you used them as slaves.",
    "Of course I love you he said.",
    "But what is it all about Edward\nIts a new world Victoria.",
    "A new world that we can create from the ruins\nof the old.",
    "Tell me.",
    "He told her the dream how the old powers must destroy each other.",
    "How\nthe fat capitalists holding on to all their money and the stupid communists who\nhated all ideas but their own must destroy each other.",
    "There must be total war\nbetween America and Russia  total destruction of both.",
    "And then the new\nHeaven and the new Earth would appear.",
    "The small chosen group of superior\nbeings the scientists the agricultural experts the administrators the young men\nlike Edward  the young men of the New World.",
    "All young all believing in their\nrule as Supermen.",
    "When the destruction was complete they would step in and\ntake control.",
    "It was madness.",
    "But think said Victoria of all the people who will be killed.",
    "That doesnt matter said Edward.",
    "But surely Victoria thought all the ordinary people working quietly\nbringing up families and laughing and crying they were the people who did\nmatter.",
    "Not these angels with evil faces who didnt care who they hurt.",
    "And carefully for she knew that death might be very near Victoria said\nYou are wonderful Edward.",
    "But what can I do\n\n\fYou want to help You believe in it\nShe had to be careful.",
    "A sudden change would be too much.",
    "I think I just believe in you she said.",
    "Anything you tell me to do\nEdward Ill do.",
    "Good girl.",
    "Why did you arrange for me to come out here There must have been a\nreason.",
    "Of course.",
    "Do you remember I took a photo of you that day\nI remember said Victoria.",
    "I couldnt believe how much you look like a woman whos been causing us\na lot of trouble.",
    "I took that photo to make sure.",
    "Who is it\nAnna Scheele.",
    "Victoria stared at him in surprise.",
    "Whatever she had expected it was not\nthis.",
    "You mean Anna Scheele looks like me\nQuite remarkably so  and youre alike in height and size though shes five\nyears older than you.",
    "The real difference is the hair youre a brunette and shes a\nblonde.",
    "Your eyes are a darker blue but that wouldnt matter with sunglasses.",
    "And thats why you wanted me to come to Baghdad Because I looked\nlike her.",
    "Yes.",
    "So you arranged the whole thing.",
    "The Clipps  who are the Clipps\nTheyre not important  they just do as theyre told.",
    "Something in Edwards\nvoice made Victoria shudder.",

    "The name and the address are fake.",
    "We think that\nGrete Harden is Anna Scheele.",
    "He added Her plane will land at Damascus the day after tomorrow.",

    "Youll take her place Victoria.",
    "Like Rupert Crofton Lee Victoria thought  and he had died.",
    "And when\nVictoria took her place Anna Scheele would die.",
    "And if for one moment Edward doubted her loyalty then Victoria would\ndie.",
    "She must agree  and then find a way to report to Mr Dakin.",
    "She took a deep breath Oh Edward Id be discovered.",
    "My voice wont\nsound the same as hers.",
    "Anna Scheele will be suffering from a serious throat infection.",
    "Our doctor\nwill say so.",
    "Then what would I have to do Victoria asked.",
    "Fly from Damascus to Baghdad as Grete Harden.",
    "Go to bed immediately.",
    "Then the doctor will give you permission to get up just in time to go to the\nConference.",
    "There before the worlds leaders you will present our papers in\nplace of Anna Scheeles.",
    "What will the documents say\nEdward smiled.",
    "Details that prove the most terrifying and huge communist\nplot in America.",
    "Victoria thought how well theyve planned it.",
    "Victoria asked What about Dr Rathbone\nEdward smiled in cruel amusement.",
    "Rathbone has been stealing most of\nthe money which comes to him from all over the world.",
    "Hes dishonest  and\n\n\fcompletely in our control.",
    "All things work towards our New Order.",
    "Victoria thought to herself Edward is mad You get mad perhaps if you\ntry and act the part of God.",
    "Humility is what keeps you human...\nEdward got up.",
    "Time to go.",
    "Weve got to get you to Damascus.",

    "Youll see me in three days.",
    "Then in his charming way\nhe said quietly Dont fail me darling.",
    "Only you can do this  I love you\nVictoria.",
    "Its too dangerous to kiss a nun  but Id like to.",
    "Victoria dropped her eyes like a good nun should but actually it was to\nhide her anger.",
    "Horrible traitor she thought.",
    "Dont worry Edward added.",

    "He stepped back waved cheerfully and the car started off.",
    "Victoria had noticed that Sister Therese had hidden a small gun in her\nsleeve.",
    "But there would be a moment Victoria could no longer be controlled when she was standing with her fake documents in front of the Conference  and\nEdward would not be there.",

    "Theres nothing of that kind said Richard going red and looking even\nmore superior than usual.",
    "Im just  er  worried about her.",
    "I must go back to\nBaghdad.",
    "You said Victoria with dislike.",
    "Taken up to her room in the Babylonian Palace Hotel in Baghdad the first\nperson she saw was Catherine dressed as a nurse.",

    "As he looked at her she saw that the heavy wooden stick carried by the\npolice was already in his hand.",
    "She knew then what Catherine meant  what the\nreal plan was.",
    "They had never intended her to play the part of Anna Scheele at\nthe Conference.",
    "How could they risk that No the plan had always been that\nAnna Scheele would be killed at the last moment  killed in such a way that her\nface would not be recognizable.",
    "Only the fake papers would remain.",
    "Victoria screamed.",
    "And with a smile the man came towards her.",
    "There was the crash of a breaking window  a heavy hand sent Victoria\ndown on to the floor  she saw stars  and blackness.",
    "Then out of the blackness a\nwonderful English voice said Are you all right Miss\n\n\f\nThe telephone rang and Dakin picked it up.",

    "No news still of the real Anna Scheele\nNo news at all\nDakin put down the phone.",
    "He was very glad to hear that Victoria was all right.",
    "But Anna herself\nDakin thought must be dead.",
    "She had refused all help had gone her own way though she had repeated that she would be in Baghdad without fail on the 19th.",
    "Today was the 19th and there was no Anna Scheele.",
    "Perhaps she had been right\nnot to trust the official organization  but apparently her own intelligence had\nbeen no better.",
    "And without Anna Scheele the evidence was not complete.",
    "A messenger came in with a note Mr Richard Baker and Mrs Pauncefoot\nJones are here to see you about Carmichael.",
    "Show them in said Dakin.",
    "Richard Baker and Mrs Pauncefoot Jones came in.",
    "Baker said I was at\nschool with a man I knew as Henry Fakir Carmichael.",
    "When I was at Basrah a\nfew weeks ago I met him in the Consulate waiting room dressed as an Arab.",
    "Does this interest you\nVery much said Dakin.",
    "Carmichael was attacked and ran away but before he went he slipped\nsomething into my pocket.",
    "The other day I learnt from Victoria Jones that he was\ndead  and you were the right person to deliver this to.",
    "He placed the dirty chit on Dakins desk.",
    "Dakin sighed deeply.",
    "This means more than you can possibly imagine.",
    "He got up.",
    "Im very\ngrateful to you Baker.",
    "Forgive me but there is a lot I have to do without wasting\na minute.",
    "He shook hands with Mrs Pauncefoot Jones saying I suppose you are\njoining your husband at the dig.",
    "I hope you have a good season.",
    "Its a good thing Pauncefoot Jones didnt come into Baghdad with me said\nRichard.",
    "He would probably have noticed the difference between his wife and\nhis wifes sister.",
    "Mrs Pauncefoot Jones said in a low pleasant voice My sister Elsie is still\nin England.",
    "I dyed my hair black and came out on her passport.",
    "My sisters name\nbefore she married was Elsie Scheele.",
    "My name Mr Dakin is Anna Scheele.",
    "CHAPTER TWENTY THREE\nBaghdad had been transformed.",
    "American and Russian Police lined the\nstreets as the news went round.",
    "The President of the United States and the\nRussian leader were in Baghdad.",
    "They were in the Regents Palace.",
    "At last the great Conference had begun.",
    "What makes me sad said Victoria sitting on the terrace overlooking the\nriver at the Tio Hotel is that poor woman who got killed in my place in\nDamascus.",
    "Oh Shes all right said Mr Dakin cheerfully.",
    "As soon as your plane had\ntaken off we arrested the French woman and took Grete Harden to hospital.",
    "She\nwas one of our people of course.",
    "Was she\nYes when Anna Scheele disappeared we thought it might be a good idea\nto give the other side something to think about.",
    "So we booked a ticket for Grete\nHarden  and gave her false papers showing she was Anna Scheele.",
    "And the real Anna Scheele came out as Mrs Pauncefoot Jones.",
    "Yes.",
    "Anna is a very clever young woman.",
    "I really thought I was going to die said Victoria.",
    "But your people were\nwatching over me.",
    "All the time.",
    "Your Edward wasnt quite so clever as he thought.",
    "Actually\nwe had been watching Edward Goring for some time.",
    "When you told me your\nstory the night Carmichael was killed I was very worried about you.",
    "The best\nthing I could think of was to send you in as a spy.",
    "If your Edward knew that you\nwere in touch with me youd be reasonably safe.",
    "Youd be too valuable to kill\nbecause hed be using you to find out what we were doing.",
    "And he could also\npass on false information to us through you.",
    "But then you told him you knew\nabout the false Rupert Crofton Lee and Edward decided it would be better to\nkeep you safely out of the way until you were needed for the impersonation of\nAnna Scheele.",
    "Yes Victoria youre very lucky to be sitting where you are now.",
    "I know I am.",
    "Victoria looked at him steadily.",
    "Next time I fall in love it\nwont be for excitement and good looks.",
    "Id like a real man  not one who says\npretty things to me.",
    "I dont mind if hes bald or wears glasses.",
    "Id like him to be\ninteresting  and know about interesting things.",
    "About thirtyfive or fiftyfive asked Mr Dakin.",
    "Victoria looked surprised.",
    "Oh thirtyfive.",
    "I am so happy.",
    "I thought for a moment you were offering to marry me.",
    "Victoria laughed.",
    "And was there a message knitted into the scarf\nThere was a name.",
    "The scarf and the chit were the two halves of the clue.",
    "The scarf gave us the name of Sheikh Hussein el Ziyara of Kerbela.",
    "He and\nCarmichael had been friends since they were children.",
    "The chit when treated\nwith chemicals gave us the code words to persuade the Sheikh to give us\nCarmichaels proof  a packet of microfilms.",
    "And it was carried through the country by those two wandering cinema\nmen  the ones we actually met\nYes.",
    "They met him when he came down from the mountains.",
    "He spent\nfour days crossing the desert in their company.",
    "Simple wellknown men.",
    "Nothing political about them.",
    "Just Carmichaels friends.",
    "He had a lot of friends.",
    "He must have been very nice.",
    "Im sorry hes dead.",
    "If theres another life after this and I fully believe that there is said Mr\nDakin hell have the satisfaction of knowing that his courage has saved this sad\nold world from a fresh attack of war and misery.",
    "All the evidence that he and Sir\nRupert and Anna Scheele collected is now before the President of America and\nthe Premier of the USSR.",
    "Its strange isnt it said Victoria thoughtfully that Richard had one half\nof the secret and I had the other.",
    "It almost seems as though...\nAs though it were meant to be finished Mr Dakin with a twinkle in his\neye.",
    "And what are you going to do next may I ask\nI will have to find a job said Victoria.",
    "I must start looking.",
    "Dont look too hard said Mr Dakin.",
    "I think a job is coming towards you.",
    "He walked away to make room for Richard Baker.",
    "Look here Victoria said Richard.",
    "Venetia Savile cant come out to the\ndig after all.",
    "Apparently shes ill. You were quite useful out there.",
    "Would you\nlike to come back We can only offer to pay for your food Im afraid.",
    "And\nprobably your passage back to England  but well talk about that later.",
    "Well\nwhat do you say\n\n\fOh do you really want me cried Victoria.",
    "For some reason Richard Baker went very pink in the face.",
    "I think he\nsaid we could find you  er  very useful.",
    "Id love that replied Victoria."
