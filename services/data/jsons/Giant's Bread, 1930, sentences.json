    "\n\fAGATHA CHRISTIE\nwriting as\nMARY WESTMACOTT\n\nGiant\u2019s Bread\n\n\fDedication\nTo the Memory of\nMy Best and Truest Friend\nMy Mother\n\n\n\fPrologue\nIt was the opening night of London\u2019s new National Opera House and\nconsequently an occasion.",
    "Royalty was there.",
    "The Press were there.",
    "The\nfashionable were there in large quantities.",
    "Even the musical by hook and by\ncrook had managed to be there \u2013 mostly very high up in the final tier of seats\nunder the roof.",
    "The musical composition given was The Giant a new work by a hitherto\nunknown composer Boris Groen.",
    "In the interval after the first part of the\nperformance a listener might have collected the following scraps of\nconversation.",
    "\u2018Quite divine darling.\u2019 \u2018They say it\u2019s simply the \u2013 the \u2013 the \u2013 latest\nEverything out of tune on purpose \u2026 And you have to read Einstein in order to\nunderstand it \u2026\u2019 \u2018Yes dear I shall tell everyone it\u2019s too marvellous.",
    "But\nprivately it does make one\u2019s head ache\u2019\n\u2018Why can\u2019t they open a British Opera House with a decent British composer\nAll this Russian tomfoolery\u2019 Thus a peppery colonel.",
    "\u2018Quite so\u2019 drawled his companion.",
    "\u2018But you see there are no British\ncomposers.",
    "Sad but there it is\u2019\n\u2018Nonsense \u2013 don\u2019t tell me sir.",
    "They just won\u2019t give them a chance \u2013 that\u2019s\nwhat it is.",
    "Who is this fellow Levinne A dirty foreign Jew.",
    "That\u2019s all he is\u2019\nA man nearby leaning against the wall half concealed by a curtain\npermitted himself to smile \u2013 for he was Sebastian Levinne sole owner of the\nNational Opera House familiarly known by the title of the World\u2019s Greatest\nShowman.",
    "He was a big man rather too well covered with flesh.",
    "His face was yellow\nand impassive his eyes beady and black two enormous ears stood out from his\nhead and were the joy of caricaturists.",
    "The surge of talk eddied past him \u2026\n\u2018Decadent \u2013 morbid \u2026 neurotic \u2026 childish \u2026\u2019\nThose were critics.",
    "\u2018Devastating \u2026 too divine \u2026 marvellous my dear \u2026\u2019\n\n\fThose were women.",
    "\u2018The thing\u2019s nothing but a glorified revue.\u2019 \u2018Amazing effects in the second\npart I believe.",
    "Machinery you know.",
    "This first part \u201cStone\u201d is only a kind of\nintroduction.",
    "They say old Levinne has simply gone all out over this.",
    "Never been\nanything like it.\u2019 \u2018Music\u2019s pretty weird isn\u2019t it\u2019 \u2018Bolshy idea I believe.",
    "Noise\norchestras don\u2019t they call them\u2019\nThose were young men more intelligent than the women less prejudiced\nthan the critics.",
    "\u2018It won\u2019t catch on.",
    "A stunt thath all.\u2019 \u2018Yet I don\u2019t know \u2013 there\u2019s a feeling\nfor this Cubist thtuff.\u2019 \u2018Levinne\u2019s shrewd.\u2019 \u2018Dropth money deliberately\nthometimes \u2013 but getth it back.\u2019 \u2018Cost \u2026\u2019 The voices dropped hushed\nthemselves mysteriously as sums of money were mentioned.",
    "Those were members of his own race.",
    "Sebastian Levinne smiled.",
    "A bell rang \u2013 slowly the crowd drifted and eddied back to their seats.",
    "There was a wait filled with chattering and laughter \u2013 then the lights\nwavered and sank.",
    "The conductor mounted to his place.",
    "In front of him was an\norchestra just six times as large as any Covent Garden orchestra and quite unlike\nan ordinary orchestra.",
    "There were strange instruments in it of shining metal like\nmisshapen monsters and in one corner an unaccustomed glitter of crystal.",
    "The\nconductor\u2019s baton was stretched out \u2013 then fell and immediately there was a low\nrhythmic beating as of hammers on anvils \u2013 every now and then a beat was\nmissed \u2013 lost \u2013 and then came floating back taking its place out of turn jostling\nthe others.",
    "The curtain rose \u2026\nAt the back of a box on the second tier Sebastian Levinne stood and\nwatched.",
    "This was no opera as commonly understood.",
    "It told no story featured no\nindividuals.",
    "Rather was it on the scale of a gigantic Russian ballet.",
    "It contained\nspectacular effects strange and weird effects of lighting \u2013 effects that were\nLevinne\u2019s own inventions.",
    "His revues had for long been proclaimed as the last\nword in sheer spectacular sensation.",
    "Into this more artist than producer he had\nput the whole force of his imagination and experience.",
    "The prologue had represented Stone \u2013 Man\u2019s infancy.",
    "This \u2013 the body of the work \u2013 was a supreme pageant of machinery \u2013\nfantastic almost awful.",
    "Power houses dynamos factory chimneys cranes all\nmerging and flowing.",
    "And men \u2013 armies of men \u2013 with Cubist robot faces \u2013\ndefiling in patterns.",
    "The music swelled and eddied \u2013 a deep sonorous clamour came from the\nnew strangely shaped metal instruments.",
    "A queer high sweet note sounded above\nit all \u2013 like the ringing of innumerable glasses \u2026\nThere was an Episode of Skyscrapers \u2013 New York seen upside down as from\na circling aeroplane in the early dawn of morning.",
    "And the strange inharmonious\nrhythm beat ever more insistently \u2013 with increasing menacing monotony.",
    "It drew\non through other episodes to its climax \u2013 a giant seeming steel erection \u2013\nthousands of steel faced men welded together into a Giant Collective Man \u2026\nThe Epilogue followed immediately.",
    "There was no interval the lights did not\ngo up.",
    "Only one side of the orchestra spoke.",
    "What was called in the new modern\nphrase \u2018the Glass\u2019.",
    "Clarion ringing notes.",
    "The curtain dissolved into mist \u2026 the mist parted \u2026 the sudden glare made\none wish to shield one\u2019s eyes.",
    "Ice \u2013 nothing but ice \u2026 great bergs and glaciers \u2026 shining \u2026\nAnd on the top immense pinnacle a little figure \u2013 facing away from the\naudience towards the insufferable glare that represented the rising of the sun \u2026\nThe ridiculous puny figure of a man \u2026\nThe glare increased \u2013 to the whiteness of magnesium.",
    "Hands went\ninstinctively to eyes with a cry of pain.",
    "The glass rang out \u2013 high and sweet \u2013 then crashed \u2013 and broke \u2013 literally\nbroke \u2013 into tinkling fragments.",
    "The curtain dropped and the lights rose.",
    "Sebastian Levinne with an impassive face received various congratulations\nand side hits.",
    "\u2018Well you\u2019ve done it this time Levinne.",
    "No half measures eh\u2019\n\u2018A damned fine show old man.",
    "Blessed if I know what it\u2019s all about\nthough.\u2019\n\u2018The Giant eh That\u2019s true we live in an age of machinery all right.\u2019\n\u2018Oh Mr Levinne it\u2019s simply too frightening for words I shall dream of that\nhorrid steel giant.\u2019\n\u2018Machinery as the Giant that devours eh Not far wrong Levinne.",
    "We want\nto get back to Nature.",
    "Who\u2019s Groen A Russian\u2019\n\u2018Yes who\u2019s Groen He\u2019s a genius whoever he is.",
    "The Bolshevists can boast\nthey\u2019ve produced one composer at last.\u2019\n\u2018Too bad Levinne you\u2019ve gone Bolshy.",
    "Collective Man.",
    "Collective Music\n\n\ftoo.\u2019\n\u2018Well Levinne good luck to you.",
    "Can\u2019t say I like this damned caterwauling\nthey call music nowadays but it\u2019s a good show.\u2019\nAlmost last came a little old man slightly bent with one shoulder higher\nthan the other.",
    "He said with a very distinct utterance\n\u2018Like to give me a drink Sebastian\u2019\nLevinne nodded.",
    "This little old man was Carl Bowerman the most\ndistinguished of English musical critics.",
    "They went together to Levinne\u2019s own\nsanctum.",
    "In Levinne\u2019s room they settled down in two armchairs.",
    "Levinne provided his\nguest with a whisky and soda.",
    "Then he looked across at him inquiringly.",
    "He was\nanxious for this man\u2019s verdict.",
    "\u2018Well\u2019\nBowerman did not reply for a minute or two.",
    "At last he said slowly\n\u2018I am an old man.",
    "There are things in which I take pleasure \u2013 there are other\nthings \u2013 such as the music of today \u2013 which do not give me pleasure.",
    "But all the\nsame I know Genius when I meet it.",
    "There are a hundred charlatans \u2013 a hundred\nbreakers down of tradition who think that by doing so they have accomplished\nsomething wonderful.",
    "And there is the hundred and first \u2013 a creator a man who\nsteps boldly into the future \u2013\u2019\nHe paused then went on.",
    "\u2018Yes I know genius when I meet it.",
    "I may not like it \u2013 but I recognize it.",
    "Groen whoever he is has genius \u2026 The music of tomorrow \u2026\u2019\nAgain he paused and again Levinne did not interrupt but waited.",
    "\u2018I don\u2019t know whether your venture will succeed or fail.",
    "I think succeed \u2013\nbut that will be mainly because of your personality.",
    "You have the art of forcing\nthe public to accept what you want them to accept.",
    "You have a talent for success.",
    "You\u2019ve made a mystery about Groen \u2013 part of your press campaign I suppose.\u2019\nHe looked at Sebastian keenly.",
    "\u2018I don\u2019t want to interfere with your press campaign but tell me one thing \u2013\nGroen\u2019s an Englishman isn\u2019t he\u2019\n\u2018Yes.",
    "How did you know Bowerman\u2019\n\u2018Nationality in music is unmistakable.",
    "He has studied in the Russian\nRevolutionary school yes \u2013 but \u2013 well as I said nationality is unmistakable.",
    "There have been pioneers before him \u2013 people who have tried tentatively the\nthings he has accomplished.",
    "We\u2019ve had our English school \u2013 Holst Vaughan\nWilliams Arnold Bax.",
    "All over the world musicians have been drawing nearer\n\n\fto the new ideal \u2013 the Absolute in Music.",
    "This man is the direct successor of that\nboy who was killed in the war what was his name Deyre \u2013 Vernon Deyre \u2013 He\nhad promise.\u2019 He sighed.",
    "\u2018I wonder Levinne how much we lost through the\nwar.\u2019\n\u2018It\u2019s difficult to say sir.\u2019\n\u2018It doesn\u2019t bear thinking of.",
    "No it doesn\u2019t bear thinking of.\u2019 He rose.",
    "\u2018I\nmustn\u2019t keep you.",
    "You\u2019ve a lot to do I know.\u2019 A faint smile showed on his face.",
    "\u2018The Giant You and Groen have your little joke all to yourselves I fancy.",
    "Everyone takes it for granted the Giant is the Moloch of Machinery \u2013 They don\u2019t\nsee that the real Giant is that pigmy figure \u2013 man.",
    "The individualist who endures\nthrough Stone and Iron and who though civilizations crumble and die fights his\nway through yet another Glacial Age to rise in a new civilization of which we do\nnot dream \u2026\u2019\nHis smile broadened.",
    "\u2018As I grow older I am more and more convinced that there is nothing so\npathetic so ridiculous so absurd and so absolutely wonderful as Man \u2013\u2019\nHe paused by the doorway his hand on the knob.",
    "\u2018One wonders\u2019 he said \u2018what has gone to the making of a thing like the\nGiant What produces it What feeds it Heredity shapes the instrument \u2013\nenvironment polishes and rounds it off \u2013 sex wakens it \u2026 But there\u2019s more than\nthat.",
    "There\u2019s its food.",
    "\u2018Fee fie fo fum\nI smell the blood of mortal man\nBe he alive or be he dead\nI\u2019ll grind his bones to make my bread.",
    "A cruel giant genius Levinne A monster feeding on flesh and blood.",
    "I know\nnothing about Groen yet I\u2019d swear that he\u2019s fed his Giant with his own flesh and\nblood and perhaps the flesh and blood of others too \u2026 Their bones ground to\nmake the Giant\u2019s bread \u2026\n\u2018I\u2019m an old man Levinne.",
    "I have my fancies.",
    "We\u2019ve seen the end tonight \u2013\nI\u2019d like to know the beginning.\u2019\n\u2018Heredity \u2013 environment \u2013 sex\u2019 said Levinne slowly.",
    "\u2018Yes.",
    "Just that.",
    "Not that I have any hopes of your telling me.\u2019\n\u2018You think I \u2013 know\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019m sure you know.\u2019\nThere was a silence.",
    "\u2018Yes\u2019 said Levinne at last \u2018I do know.",
    "I would tell you the whole story if I\ncould \u2013 but I cannot.",
    "There are reasons \u2026\u2019\nHe repeated slowly \u2018There are reasons \u2026\u2019\n\u2018A pity.",
    "It would have been interesting.\u2019\n\u2018I wonder \u2026\u2019\n\n\fBook One\nAbbots Puissants\n\n\fChapter One\n1\nThere were only three people of real importance in Vernon\u2019s world Nurse God\nand Mr Green.",
    "There were of course the nursemaids.",
    "Winnie the present one and behind\nher Jane and Annie and Sarah and Gladys.",
    "Those were all the ones that Vernon\ncould remember but there were lots more.",
    "Nursery maids never stayed long\nbecause they couldn\u2019t get on with Nurse.",
    "They hardly counted in Vernon\u2019s\nworld.",
    "There was also a kind of twin deity called MummyDaddy mentioned by\nVernon in his prayers and also connected with going down to dessert.",
    "They were\nshadowy figures rather beautiful and wonderful \u2013 especially Mummy \u2013 but they\nagain did not belong to the real world \u2013 Vernon\u2019s world.",
    "The things in Vernon\u2019s world were very real indeed.",
    "There was the drugget\non the nursery floor for instance.",
    "It was of green and white stripes and rather\nscrubbly to bare knees and in one corner of it was a hole which Vernon used\nsurreptitiously to make bigger by working his fingers round in it.",
    "There were the\nnursery walls where mauve irises twined themselves interminably upwards\nround a pattern that was sometimes diamonds and sometimes if you looked at it\nlong enough crosses.",
    "That seemed very interesting to Vernon and rather\nmagical.",
    "There was a rocking horse against one wall but Vernon seldom rode on it.",
    "There was a basketwork engine and some basketwork trucks which he played\nwith a good deal.",
    "There was a low cupboard full of more or less dilapidated toys.",
    "On an upper shelf were the more delectable contents that you played with on a\nwet day or when Nurse was in an unusually good temper.",
    "The Paint Box was\nthere and the Real Camel Hair Brushes and a heap of illustrated papers for\nCutting Out.",
    "In fact all the things that Nurse said were \u2018that messy she couldn\u2019t\nabear them about\u2019.",
    "In other words the best things.",
    "And in the centre of this realistic nursery universe dominating everything\nwas Nurse herself.",
    "Person No.",
    "1 of Vernon\u2019s Trinity.",
    "Very big and broad very\n\n\fstarched and crackling.",
    "Omniscient and omnipotent.",
    "You couldn\u2019t get the better\nof Nurse.",
    "She knew better than little boys.",
    "She frequently said so.",
    "Her whole\nlifetime had been spent looking after little boys and incidentally little girls too\nbut Vernon was not interested in them and one and all they had grown up to be\na Credit to her.",
    "She said so and Vernon believed her.",
    "He had no doubt that he\nalso would grow up to be a Credit to her though sometimes it didn\u2019t seem likely.",
    "There was something aweinspiring about Nurse but at the same time infinitely\ncomfortable.",
    "She knew the answer to everything.",
    "For instance Vernon\npropounded the riddle about the diamonds and the crosses on the wallpaper.",
    "\u2018Ah well\u2019 said Nurse \u2018there\u2019s two ways of looking at everything.",
    "You must\nhave heard that.\u2019\nAnd as Vernon had heard her say much the same to Winnie one day he was\nsoothed and satisfied.",
    "On the occasion in question Nurse had gone on to say that\nthere were always two sides to a question and in future Vernon always\nvisualized a question as something like a letter A with crosses creeping up one\nside of it and diamonds going down the other.",
    "After Nurse there was God.",
    "God was also very real to Vernon mainly\nbecause he bulked so largely in Nurse\u2019s conversation.",
    "Nurse knew most things\nthat you did but God knew everything and God was if anything more\nparticular than Nurse.",
    "You couldn\u2019t see God which Vernon always felt gave\nhim rather an unfair advantage over you because he could see you.",
    "Even in the\ndark he could see you.",
    "Sometimes when Vernon was in bed at night the thought\nof God looking down at him through the darkness used to give him a creepy\nfeeling down the spine.",
    "But on the whole God was an intangible person compared with Nurse.",
    "You\ncould conveniently forget about him most of the time.",
    "That was until Nurse\nlugged him deliberately into the conversation.",
    "Once Vernon essayed revolt.",
    "\u2018Nurse do you know what I shall do when I\u2019m dead\u2019\nNurse who was knitting stockings said \u2018One two three four there now\nI\u2019ve dropped a stitch.",
    "No Master Vernon I\u2019m sure I don\u2019t.\u2019\n\u2018I shall go to Heaven \u2013 I shall go to Heaven \u2013 and I shall go right up to God \u2013\nright up to him I shall go and I shall say \u201cYou\u2019re an \u2019orrible man and I \u2019ate\nyou\u201d\u2019\nSilence.",
    "It was done.",
    "He had said it.",
    "Unbelievable unparalleled audacity\nWhat would happen What awful punishment terrestrial or celestial would\ndescend upon him He waited \u2013 breathless.",
    "Nurse had picked up the stitch.",
    "She looked at Vernon over the top of her\nspectacles.",
    "She was serene \u2013 unruffled.",
    "\u2018It\u2019s not likely\u2019 she remarked \u2018that the Almighty will take any notice of\nwhat a naughty little boy says.",
    "Winnie give me those scissors if you please.\u2019\nVernon retired crestfallen.",
    "It was no good.",
    "You couldn\u2019t down Nurse.",
    "He\nmight have known.",
    "2\nAnd then there was Mr Green.",
    "Mr Green was like God in that you couldn\u2019t see\nhim but to Vernon he was very real.",
    "He knew for instance exactly what Mr\nGreen looked like \u2013 of middle height rather stout a faint resemblance to the\nvillage grocer who sang an uncertain baritone in the village choir bright red\ncheeks and mutton chop whiskers.",
    "His eyes were blue a very bright blue.",
    "The\ngreat thing about Mr Green was that he played \u2013 he loved playing.",
    "Whatever\ngame Vernon thought of that was just the game that Mr Green loved to play.",
    "There were other points about him.",
    "He had for instance a hundred children.",
    "And three others.",
    "The hundred in Vernon\u2019s mind were kept intact a joyous\nmob that raced down the yew alleys behind Vernon and Mr Green.",
    "But the three\nothers were different.",
    "They were called by the three most beautiful names that\nVernon knew Poodle Squirrel and Tree.",
    "Vernon was perhaps a lonely little boy but he never knew it.",
    "Because you\nsee he had Mr Green and Poodle Squirrel and Tree to play with.",
    "3\nFor a long time Vernon was undecided as to where Mr Green\u2019s home was.",
    "It\ncame to him quite suddenly that of course Mr Green lived in the Forest.",
    "The\nForest had always been fascinating to Vernon.",
    "One side of the Park bordered on\nit.",
    "There were high green palings and Vernon used to creep along them hoping\nfor a crack that would let him see through.",
    "There were whisperings and sighings\nand rustlings all along as though the trees were speaking to each other.",
    "Halfway down there was a door but alas it was always locked so that Vernon could\nnever see what it was really like inside the Forest.",
    "Nurse of course would never take him there.",
    "She was like all nurses and\npreferred a good steady walk along the road and no messing your feet up with\nthem nasty damp leaves.",
    "So Vernon was never allowed to go in the Forest.",
    "It\n\n\fmade him think of it all the more.",
    "Some day he would take tea there with Mr\nGreen.",
    "Poodle and Squirrel and Tree were to have new suits for the occasion.",
    "4\nThe nursery palled on Vernon.",
    "It was too small.",
    "He knew all there was to know\nabout it.",
    "The garden was different.",
    "It was really a very exciting garden.",
    "There\nwere so many different bits of it.",
    "The long walks between the clipped yew\nhedges with their ornamental birds the water garden with the fat goldfish the\nwalled fruit garden the wild garden with its almond trees in spring time and the\ncopse of silver birch trees with bluebells growing underneath and best of all the\nrailedoff bit where the ruins of the old Abbey were.",
    "That was the place where\nVernon would have liked to be left to his own devices \u2013 to climb and explore.",
    "But he never was.",
    "The rest of the garden he did much as he liked in.",
    "Winnie was\nalways sent out with him but since by a remarkable coincidence they always\nseemed to encounter the second gardener he could play his own games\nunhindered by too much kind attention on Winnie\u2019s part.",
    "5\nGradually Vernon\u2019s world widened.",
    "The twin star MummyDaddy separated\nbecame two distinct people.",
    "Daddy remained nebulous but Mummy became\nquite a personage.",
    "She often paid visits to the nursery to \u2018play with my darling\nlittle boy\u2019.",
    "Vernon bore her visits with grave politeness though it usually meant\ngiving up the game that he himself was engaged upon and accepting one which\nwas not in his opinion nearly so good.",
    "Lady visitors would sometimes come\nwith her and then she would squeeze Vernon tightly which he hated and cry\n\u2018It\u2019s so wonderful to be a mother I never get used to it To have a darling\nbaby boy of one\u2019s very own.\u2019\nVery red Vernon would extricate himself from her embrace.",
    "Because he\nwasn\u2019t a baby boy at all.",
    "He was three years old.",
    "Looking across the room one day just after a scene like the above he saw\nhis father standing by the nursery door with sardonic eyes watching him.",
    "Their\neyes met.",
    "Something seemed to pass between them \u2013 comprehension \u2013 a sense of\nkinship.",
    "His mother\u2019s friends were talking.",
    "\u2018Such a pity Myra that he doesn\u2019t take after you.",
    "Your hair would be too\n\n\flovely on a child.\u2019\nBut Vernon had a sudden feeling of pride.",
    "He was like his father.",
    "6\nVernon always remembered the day that the American lady came to lunch.",
    "To\nbegin with because of Nurse\u2019s explanations about America which as he realized\nlater she confused with Australia.",
    "He went down to dessert in an awestricken state.",
    "If this lady had been at\nhome in her own country she would be walking about upside down with her\nhead hanging down.",
    "Quite enough this to make him stare.",
    "And then too she\nused odd words for the simplest things.",
    "\u2018Isn\u2019t he too cute See here honey I\u2019ve gotten a box of candy for you.",
    "Won\u2019t you come and fetch it\u2019\nVernon came gingerly accepted the present.",
    "The lady clearly didn\u2019t know\nwhat she was talking about.",
    "It wasn\u2019t candy but good Edinburgh Rock.",

    "This one said\n\u2018Do you know half a crown my boy when you see it\u2019\nAnd it presently turned out that the halfcrown was to be for his very own to\nkeep.",
    "Altogether it was a wonderful day.",
    "Vernon had never thought very much about his home.",
    "He knew that it was\nbigger than the Vicarage where he sometimes went to tea but he seldom played\nwith any other children or went to their homes.",
    "So it came to him with a shock of\nwonder that day.",
    "The visitors were taken all over the house and the American\nlady\u2019s voice rose ceaselessly.",

    "And the Abbey older still you say\u2019\nThey went everywhere through the long picture gallery where faces\nstrangely like Vernon\u2019s with dark eyes set close together and narrow heads\nlooked out from the painted canvas arrogantly or with cold tolerance.",
    "There were\nmeek women there in ruffs or with pearls twisted in their hair \u2013 the Deyre\nwomen had done best to be meek married to wild lords who knew neither fear\nnor pity \u2013 who looked appraisingly at Myra Deyre the last of their number as\nshe walked beneath them.",

    "He was not much of a talker so\nfar Vernon had not heard him speak at all.",
    "But he now unclosed his lips and\nuttered one word \u2013 a word so enchanting so mysterious so delightful that\nVernon never forgot it.",
    "\u2018Brumagem\u2019 said the other gentleman.",
    "And before Vernon could ask him as he meant to do what that marvellous\nword meant another diversion occurred.",
    "His mother came out of the house.",
    "There was a sunset behind her \u2013 a scene\npainter\u2019s sunset of crude gold and red.",
    "Against that background Vernon saw his\nmother \u2013 saw her for the first time \u2013 a magnificent woman with white skin and\nred gold hair \u2013 a being like the pictures in his fairy book saw her suddenly as\nsomething wonderful and beautiful.",

    "She did not send for him and it did not occur to him to go to\nher.",
    "Indeed he was vaguely relieved.",
    "He hated the noise of crying the gulping\nsound the longdrawn sniffs and it always happened so close to your ears.",
    "People who were crying always hugged you.",
    "Vernon hated those kind of noises\nclose to his ears.",
    "There was nothing in the world he hated more than the wrong\nsort of noise.",

    "But\nwhat you\u2019ve done is unbecoming.",
    "Unbecoming \u2013 I can\u2019t say more than that.\u2019\nAnd as Vernon had often noticed after using this particular phrase she\nproceeded to say a good deal more.",
    "But he did not listen for he was pondering\non the word Unbecoming.",
    "Becoming he knew was a thing you said about a hat.",
    "Where did a hat come in\n\u2018What\u2019s unbecoming Nurse\u2019 he asked later in the day.",

    "It was he knew a word that gentlemen used but\nlittle boys didn\u2019t.",
    "So great a fascination did that fact lend it that Vernon was in\nthe habit of sending himself to sleep by repeating it over to himself in company\nwith another forbidden word.",
    "The other word was Corsets.",
    "\u2018Who the devil told you that\u2019\n\u2018Nobody told me\u2019 said Vernon after reflecting a minute.",

    "This puzzled Vernon\nvery much.",
    "He asked Nurse for an explanation.",
    "\u2018There are names that are suitable to the gentry Master Vernon and names\nthat are suitable for servants.",
    "That\u2019s all there is to it.\u2019\n\u2018Then why is her real name Isabel\u2019\n\u2018There are people who when they christen their children set themselves up to\nape their betters.\u2019\nThe word ape had a distracting influence on Vernon.",
    "Apes were monkeys.",

    "He just wanted\nto know.",
    "You\u2019d got to know.",
    "That was part of growing up.",
    "When you were\n\n\fgrown up you knew everything and had gold sovereigns in your purse.",
    "2\nThe world went on widening.",
    "There were for instance uncles and aunts.",

    "\u2018No sense of humour at all.",
    "A pity.\u2019\nAunt Nina Father\u2019s sister was quite different.",
    "She smelt nice like the garden on a summer\u2019s day and she had a soft voice\nthat Vernon liked.",
    "She had other virtues \u2013 she didn\u2019t kiss you when you didn\u2019t\nwant to be kissed and she didn\u2019t insist on making jokes.",

    "It had four legs and a shiny brown\nbody.",
    "And it had a long row of what Vernon had thought when he was very\nsmall to be teeth.",
    "Great yellow shining teeth.",
    "From his earliest memory Vernon\nhad been fascinated and terrified by The Beast.",
    "For if you irritated The Beast it\nmade strange noises an angry growling or a shrill angry wail \u2013 and somehow\nthose noises hurt you more than anything in the world could they hurt you right\ndown in your inside.",
    "They made you shiver and feel sick and they made your\neyes sting and burn and yet by some strange enchantment you couldn\u2019t go\n\n\faway.",
    "When Vernon had stories read to him about dragons he always thought of\nthem as like The Beast.",
    "And some of the best games with Mr Green were where\nthey killed The Beast \u2013 Vernon plunging a sword into his brown shining body\nwhilst the hundred children whooped and sang behind.",
    "Now that he was a big boy \u2013 he knew better of course.",
    "He knew that The\nBeast\u2019s name was Grand Piano and that when you deliberately attacked its teeth\nthat was called \u2018playingthepiano\u2019 and that ladies did it after dinner to\ngentlemen.",
    "But in his inmost heart he was still afraid and dreamt sometimes of\nThe Beast pursuing him up the nursery stairs \u2013 and he would wake up\nscreaming.",
    "In his dreams The Beast lived in the Forest and was wild and savage and\nthe noises it made were too terrible to be borne.",
    "Mummy sometimes did \u2018playingthepiano\u2019 and that Vernon could just bear\nwith difficulty.",

    "Nurse herself he had always regarded as terribly old.",

    "The Universe shifted \u2013 values were readjusted.",

    "He\u2019s like a little demon\nsometimes.",
    "And him so good and well behaved with Mrs Pascal.\u2019\nTo which Kate replied\n\u2018Ah she\u2019s a one she is Takes you up sharp doesn\u2019t she\u2019\nAnd then they would whisper and giggle.",
    "\u2018Who\u2019s Mrs Pascal\u2019 Vernon asked one day.",
    "\u2018Well I never Master Vernon Don\u2019t you know your own Nurse\u2019s name\u2019\nSo Nurse was Mrs Pascal.",
    "Another shock.",
    "She had always been just Nurse.",
    "It\nwas rather as though you had been told that God\u2019s name was Mr Robinson.",
    "Mrs Pascal Nurse The more you thought of it the more extraordinary it\nseemed.",
    "Mrs Pascal \u2013 just like Mummy was Mrs Deyre and Father was Mr\nDeyre.",
    "Strangely enough Vernon never cogitated on the possibility of a Mr\nPascal.",
    "Not that there was any such person.",
    "The Mrs was a tacit recognition of\n\n\fNurse\u2019s position and authority.",
    "Nurse stood alone in the same magnificence as\nMr Green who in spite of the hundred children and Poodle Squirrel and Tree\nwas never thought of by Vernon as having a Mrs Green attached to him\nVernon\u2019s inquiring mind wandered in another direction.",
    "\u2018Susan do you like\nbeing called Susan Wouldn\u2019t you like being called Isabel better\u2019\nSusan or Isabel gave her customary giggle.",
    "\u2018It doesn\u2019t matter what I like Master Vernon.\u2019\n\u2018Why not\u2019\n\u2018People have got to do what they\u2019re told in this world.\u2019\nVernon was silent.",
    "He had thought the same until a few days ago.",
    "But he was\nbeginning to perceive that it was not true.",
    "You needn\u2019t do as you were told.",
    "It all\ndepended on who told you.",
    "It was not a question of punishment.",
    "He was continually being sat on chairs\nstood in the corner and deprived of sweets by Susan.",
    "Nurse on the other hand\nhad only had to look at him severely through her spectacles with a certain\nexpression on her face and anything but immediate capitulation was out of the\nquestion.",
    "Susan had no authority in her nature and Vernon knew it.",
    "He had discovered\nthe thrill of successful disobedience.",
    "Also he liked tormenting Susan.",
    "The more\nworried and flustered and unhappy Susan got the more Vernon liked it.",
    "He was\nas was proper to his years still in the Stone Age.",
    "He savoured the full pleasure\nof cruelty.",
    "Susan formed the habit of letting Vernon go out to play in the garden alone.",
    "Being an unattractive girl she had not Winnie\u2019s reasons for liking the garden.",
    "And besides what harm could possibly come to him\n\u2018You won\u2019t go near the ponds will you Master Vernon\u2019\n\u2018No\u2019 said Vernon instantly forming the intention to do so.",
    "\u2018You\u2019ll play with your hoop like a good boy\u2019\n\u2018Yes.\u2019\nThe nursery was left in peace.",
    "Susan heaved a sigh of relief.",
    "She took from a\ndrawer a papercovered book entitled The Duke and the Dairymaid.",
    "Beating his hoop Vernon made the tour of the walled fruit garden.",
    "Escaping\nfrom his control the hoop leapt upon a small patch of earth which was at the\nmoment receiving the meticulous attentions of Hopkins the head gardener.",
    "Hopkins firmly and authoritatively ordered Vernon from the spot and Vernon\nwent.",
    "He respected Hopkins.",
    "Abandoning the hoop Vernon climbed a tree or two.",
    "That is to say he\n\n\freached a height of perhaps six feet from the ground employing all due\nprecautions.",
    "Tiring of this perilous sport he sat astride a branch and cogitated as\nto what to do next.",
    "On the whole he thought of the ponds.",
    "Susan having forbidden them they\nhad a distinct fascination.",
    "Yes he would go to the ponds.",
    "He rose and as he did\nso another idea came into his head suggested by an unusual sight.",
    "The door into the Forest was open\n\n5\nSuch a thing had never happened before in Vernon\u2019s experience.",
    "Again and\nagain he had secretly tried that door.",
    "Always it was locked.",
    "He crept up to it cautiously.",
    "The Forest It stood a few steps away outside the\ndoor.",
    "You could plunge straightway into its cool green depths.",
    "Vernon\u2019s heart\nbeat faster.",
    "He had always wanted to go into the Forest.",
    "Here was his chance.",
    "Once\nNurse came back any such thing would be out of the question.",
    "And still he hesitated.",
    "It was not any feeling of disobedience that held him\nback.",
    "Strictly speaking he had never been forbidden to go in the Forest.",
    "His\nchildish cunning was all ready with that excuse.",
    "No it was something else.",
    "Fear of the unknown \u2013 of those dark leafy depths.",
    "Ancestral memories held him back \u2026\nHe wanted to go \u2013 but he didn\u2019t want to go.",
    "There might be Things there \u2013\nThings like The Beast.",
    "Things that came up behind you \u2013 that chased you\nscreaming \u2026\nHe moved uneasily from one foot to the other.",
    "But Things didn\u2019t chase you in the daytime.",
    "And Mr Green lived in the\nForest.",
    "Not that Mr Green was as real as he used to be.",
    "Still it would be rather\njolly to explore and find a place where you would pretend Mr Green did live.",
    "Poodle Squirrel and Tree would each have houses of their own \u2013 small leafy\nhouses.",
    "\u2018Come on Poodle\u2019 said Vernon to an invisible companion.",
    "\u2018Have you got\nyour bow and arrow That\u2019s right.",
    "We\u2019ll meet Squirrel inside.\u2019\nHe stepped out jauntily.",
    "Beside him plain to Vernon\u2019s inner eye went\nPoodle dressed like the picture of Robinson Crusoe in his picture book.",
    "It was wonderful in the Forest \u2013 dim and dark and green.",
    "Birds sang and flew\nfrom branch to branch.",
    "Vernon continued to talk to his friend \u2013 a luxury he did\n\n\fnot dare to permit himself often since someone might overhear and say \u2018Isn\u2019t\nhe too funny He\u2019s pretending he\u2019s got another little boy with him.\u2019 You had to\nbe so very careful at home.",
    "\u2018We\u2019ll get to the Castle by lunch time Poodle.",
    "There are going to be roasted\nleopards.",
    "Oh Hullo here\u2019s Squirrel.",
    "How are you Squirrel Where\u2019s Tree\u2019\n\u2018I tell you what.",
    "I think it\u2019s rather tiring walking.",
    "I think we\u2019ll ride.\u2019\nSteeds were tethered to an adjacent tree.",
    "Vernon\u2019s was milk white Poodle\u2019s\nwas coal black \u2013 the colour of Squirrel\u2019s he couldn\u2019t quite decide.",
    "They galloped forward through the trees.",
    "There were deadly dangerous\nplaces morasses.",
    "Snakes hissed at them and lions charged them.",
    "But the faithful\nsteeds did all their riders required of them.",
    "How silly it was playing in the garden \u2013 or playing anywhere but here He\u2019d\nforgotten what it was like playing with Mr Green and Poodle Squirrel and Tree.",
    "How could you help forgetting things when people were always reminding you\nthat you were a funny little boy playing make believe.",
    "On strutted Vernon now capering now marching with solemn dignity.",
    "He\nwas great he was wonderful What he needed though he did not know it\nhimself was a tomtom to beat whilst he sang his own praises.",
    "The Forest He had always known it would be like this and it was In front\nof him suddenly appeared a crumbling mosscovered wall.",
    "The wall of the\nCastle Could anything be more perfect He began to climb it.",
    "The ascent was easy enough really though fraught with the most agreeable\nand thrilling possibilities of danger.",
    "Whether this was Mr Green\u2019s Castle or\nwhether it was inhabited by an Ogre who ate human flesh Vernon had not yet\nmade up his mind.",
    "Either was an entrancing proposition.",
    "On the whole he\ninclined to the latter being at the moment in a warlike frame of mind.",
    "With a\nflushed face he reached the summit of the wall and looked over the other side.",
    "And here there enters into the story for one brief paragraph Mrs Somers\nWest who was fond of romantic solitude for short periods and had bought\nWoods Cottage as being \u2018delightfully remote from anywhere and really if you\nknow what I mean in the very heart of the Forest \u2013 at one with Nature\u2019 And\nsince Mrs Somers West as well as being artistic was musical she had pulled\ndown a wall making two rooms into one and had thus provided herself with\nsufficient space to house a grand piano.",
    "And at the identical moment that Vernon reached the top of the wall several\nperspiring and staggering men were slowly propelling the aforesaid grand piano\ntowards the window since it wouldn\u2019t go in by the door.",
    "The garden of Woods\n\n\fCottage was a mere tangle of undergrowth \u2013 wild Nature as Mrs Somers West\ncalled it.",
    "So that all Vernon saw was The Beast The Beast alive and purposeful\nslowly crawling towards him malign and vengeful \u2026\nFor a moment he stayed rooted to the spot.",
    "Then with a wild cry he fled.",
    "Fled along the top of the narrow crumbling wall.",
    "The Beast was behind him\npursuing him \u2026 It was coming he knew it.",
    "He ran \u2013 ran faster than ever \u2013 His\nfoot caught in a tangle of ivy.",
    "He crashed downwards \u2013 falling \u2013 falling \u2013\n\n\fChapter Four\n1\nVernon woke after a long time to find himself in bed.",
    "It was of course the\nnatural place to be when you woke up but what wasn\u2019t natural was to have a\ngreat hump sticking up in front of you in the bed.",
    "It was whilst he was staring at\nthis that someone spoke to him.",
    "That someone was Dr Coles whom Vernon\nknew quite well.",
    "\u2018Well well\u2019 said Dr Coles \u2018and how are we feeling\u2019\nVernon didn\u2019t know how Dr Coles was feeling.",
    "He himself was feeling\nrather sick and said so.",
    "\u2018I daresay I daresay\u2019 said Dr Coles.",
    "\u2018And I think I hurt somewhere\u2019 said Vernon.",
    "\u2018I think I hurt very much.\u2019\n\u2018I daresay I daresay\u2019 said Dr Coles again \u2013 not very helpfully Vernon\nthought.",
    "\u2018Perhaps I\u2019d feel better if I got up\u2019 said Vernon.",
    "\u2018Can I get up\u2019\n\u2018Not just now I\u2019m afraid\u2019 said the doctor.",
    "\u2018You see you\u2019ve had a fall.\u2019\n\u2018Yes\u2019 said Vernon.",
    "\u2018The Beast came after me.\u2019\n\u2018Eh What\u2019s that The Beast What Beast\u2019\n\u2018Nothing\u2019 said Vernon.",
    "\u2018A dog I expect\u2019 said the doctor.",
    "\u2018Jumped at the wall and barked.",
    "You\nmustn\u2019t be afraid of dogs my boy.\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019m not\u2019 said Vernon.",
    "\u2018And what were you doing so far from home eh No business to be where\nyou were.\u2019\n\u2018Nobody told me not to\u2019 said Vernon.",
    "\u2018Hum hum I wonder.",
    "Well I\u2019m afraid you\u2019ve got to take your punishment.",
    "Do you know you\u2019ve broken your leg my boy\u2019\n\u2018Have I\u2019 Vernon was gratified \u2013 enchanted.",
    "He had broken his leg.",
    "He felt\nvery important.",
    "\u2018Yes you\u2019ll have to lie here for a bit \u2013 and then it will mean crutches for a\nwhile.",
    "Do you know what crutches are\u2019\n\n\fYes Vernon knew.",
    "Mr Jobber the blacksmith\u2019s father had crutches.",
    "And he\nwas to have crutches How wonderful\n\u2018Can I try them now\u2019\nDr Coles laughed.",
    "\u2018So you like the idea No I\u2019m afraid you\u2019ll have to wait a bit.",
    "And you must\ntry and be a brave boy you know.",
    "And then you\u2019ll get well quicker.\u2019\n\u2018Thank you\u2019 said Vernon politely.",
    "\u2018I don\u2019t think I do feel very well.",
    "Can you\ntake this funny thing out of my bed I think it would be more comfortable then.\u2019\nBut it seemed that the funny thing was called a cradle and that it couldn\u2019t be\ntaken away.",
    "And it seemed too that Vernon would not be able to move about in\nbed because his leg was all tied up to a long piece of wood.",
    "And suddenly it\ndidn\u2019t seem a very nice thing to have a broken leg after all.",
    "Vernon\u2019s underlip trembled a little.",
    "He was not going to cry \u2013 no he was a\nbig boy and big boys didn\u2019t cry.",
    "Nurse said so \u2013 and then he knew that he\nwanted Nurse \u2013 wanted her badly.",
    "He wanted her reassuring presence her\nomniscience her creaking rustling majesty.",
    "\u2018She\u2019ll be coming back soon\u2019 said Dr Coles.",
    "\u2018Yes soon.",
    "In the meantime\nthis Nurse is going to look after you \u2013 Nurse Frances.\u2019\nNurse Frances moved into Vernon\u2019s range of vision and Vernon studied her\nin silence.",
    "She too was starched and crackling that was all to the good.",
    "But she\nwasn\u2019t big like Nurse \u2013 she was thinner than Mummy \u2013 as thin as Aunt Nina.",
    "He\nwasn\u2019t sure \u2013\nAnd then he met her eyes \u2013 steady eyes more green than grey and he felt as\nmost people felt that with Nurse Frances things would be \u2018all right\u2019.",
    "She smiled at him \u2013 but not in the way that visitors smiled.",
    "It was a grave\nsmile friendly but reserved.",
    "\u2018I\u2019m sorry you feel sick\u2019 she said.",
    "\u2018Would you like some orange juice\u2019\nVernon considered the matter and said he thought he would.",
    "Dr Coles went\nout of the room and Nurse Frances brought him the orange juice in a most\ncuriouslooking cup with a long spout.",
    "And it appeared that Vernon was to drink\nfrom the spout.",
    "It made him laugh but laughing hurt him and so he stopped.",
    "Nurse Frances\nsuggested he should go to sleep again but he said he didn\u2019t want to go to sleep.",
    "\u2018Then I shouldn\u2019t go to sleep\u2019 said Nurse Frances.",
    "\u2018I wonder if you can\ncount how many irises there are on that wall You can start on the right side and\nI\u2019ll start on the left side.",
    "You can count can\u2019t you\u2019\nVernon said proudly that he could count up to a hundred.",
    "\u2018That is a lot\u2019 said Nurse Frances.",
    "\u2018There aren\u2019t nearly as many irises as a\nhundred.",
    "I guess there are seventynine.",
    "Now what do you guess\u2019\nVernon guessed that there were fifty.",
    "There couldn\u2019t he felt sure possibly be\nmore than that.",
    "He began to count but somehow without knowing it his eyelids\nclosed and he slept \u2026\n\n2\nNoise \u2026 Noise and pain \u2026 He woke with a start.",
    "He felt hot very hot and there\nwas a pain all down one side.",
    "And the noise was coming nearer.",
    "It was the noise\nthat one always connected with Mummy \u2026\nShe came into the room like a whirlwind a kind of cloak affair she wore\nswinging out behind her.",
    "She was like a bird \u2013 a great big bird and like a bird\nshe swooped down upon him.",
    "\u2018Vernon \u2013 my darling \u2013 Mummy\u2019s own darling \u2013 What have they done to\nyou \u2013 How awful \u2013 how terrible \u2013 My child\u2019\nShe was crying.",
    "Vernon began to cry too.",
    "He was suddenly frightened.",
    "Myra\nwas moaning and weeping.",
    "\u2018My little child.",
    "All I have in the world.",
    "God don\u2019t take him from me.",
    "Don\u2019t\ntake him from me If he dies I shall die too\u2019\n\u2018Mrs Deyre \u2013\u2019\n\u2018Vernon \u2013 Vernon \u2013 my baby \u2013\u2019\n\u2018Mrs Deyre \u2013 please.\u2019\nThere was crisp command in the voice rather than appeal.",
    "\u2018Please don\u2019t touch him.",
    "You will hurt him.\u2019\n\u2018Hurt him I His mother\u2019\n\u2018You don\u2019t seem to realize Mrs Deyre that his leg is broken.",
    "I must ask you\nplease to leave the room.\u2019\n\u2018You\u2019re hiding something from me \u2013 tell me \u2013 tell me \u2013 will the leg have to\nbe amputated\u2019\nA wail came from Vernon.",
    "He had not the least idea what amputated meant \u2013\nbut it sounded painful \u2013 and more than painful terrifying.",
    "His wail broke into a\nscream.",
    "\u2018He\u2019s dying\u2019 cried Myra.",
    "\u2018He\u2019s dying \u2013 and they won\u2019t tell me.",
    "But he shall\ndie in my arms.\u2019\n\u2018Mrs Deyre \u2013\u2019\nSomehow Nurse Frances had got between his mother and the bed.",
    "She was\n\n\fholding his mother by the shoulder.",
    "Her voice had the tone that Nurse\u2019s had had\nwhen speaking to Katie the underhousemaid.",
    "\u2018Mrs Deyre listen to me.",
    "You must control yourself.",
    "You must\u2019 Then she\nlooked up.",
    "Vernon\u2019s father was standing in the doorway.",
    "\u2018Mr Deyre please take\nyour wife away.",
    "I cannot have my patient excited and upset.\u2019\nHis father nodded \u2013 a quiet understanding nod.",
    "He just looked at Vernon\nonce and said \u2018Bad luck old chap.",
    "I broke an arm once.\u2019\nThe world became suddenly less terrifying.",
    "Other people broke legs and\narms.",
    "His father had hold of his mother\u2019s shoulder he was leading her towards\nthe door speaking to her in a low voice.",
    "She was protesting arguing her voice\nhigh and shrill with emotion.",
    "\u2018How can you understand You\u2019ve never cared for the child like I have.",
    "It\ntakes a mother \u2013 How can I leave my child to be looked after by a stranger He\nneeds his mother \u2026 You don\u2019t understand \u2013 I love him.",

    "\u2018I want Nurse \u2026\u2019\nHe meant his own Nurse not Nurse Frances.",
    "\u2018Oh\u2019 said Myra.",
    "She stood there quivering.",
    "\u2018Come my dear\u2019 said Vernon\u2019s father gently.",
    "\u2018Come away.\u2019\nShe leant against him and together they passed from the room.",
    "Faint words\nfloated back into the room.",
    "\u2018My own child to turn from me to a stranger.\u2019\nNurse Frances smoothed the sheet and suggested a drink of water.",
    "\u2018Nurse is coming back very soon\u2019 she said.",
    "\u2018We\u2019ll write to her today shall\nwe You shall tell me what to say.\u2019\nA queer new feeling surged over Vernon \u2013 a sort of odd gratitude.",
    "Somebody\nhad actually understood \u2026\n\n3\nWhen Vernon later was to look back upon his childhood this one period was to\nstand out quite clearly from the rest.",
    "\u2018The time I broke my leg\u2019 marked a distinct\nera.",
    "He was to appreciate too various small incidents that were accepted by him\nat the time as a matter of course.",
    "For instance a rather stormy interview that\n\n\ftook place between Dr Coles and his mother.",
    "Naturally this did not take place in\nVernon\u2019s sick room but Myra\u2019s raised voice penetrated closed doors.",
    "Vernon\nheard indignant exclamations of \u2018I don\u2019t know what you mean by upsetting\nhim \u2026 I consider I ought to nurse my own child \u2026 Naturally I was distressed \u2013\nI\u2019m not one of these people who simply have no heart \u2013 no heart at all.",
    "Look at\nWalter \u2013 never turned a hair\u2019\nThere were many skirmishes too not to say pitched battles fought between\nMyra and Nurse Frances.",
    "In these cases Nurse Frances always won but at a\ncertain cost.",
    "Myra Deyre was wildly and furiously jealous of what she called \u2018the\npaid Nurse\u2019.",
    "She was forced to submit to Dr Cole\u2019s dictums but she did so with\na bad grace and with an overt rudeness that Nurse Frances never seemed to\nnotice.",
    "In after years Vernon remembered nothing of the pain and tedium that there\nmust have been.",
    "He only remembered happy days of playing and talking as he\nhad never played and talked before.",
    "For in Nurse Frances he found a grown up\nwho didn\u2019t think things \u2018funny\u2019 or \u2018quaint\u2019.",
    "Somebody who listened sensibly and\nwho made serious and sensible suggestions.",
    "To Nurse Frances he was able to\nspeak of Poodle Squirrel and Tree and of Mr Green and the hundred children.",
    "And instead of saying \u2018What a funny game\u2019 Nurse Frances merely inquired\nwhether the hundred children were girls or boys \u2013 an aspect of the matter which\nVernon had never thought of before.",
    "But he and Nurse Frances decided that\nthere were fifty of each which seemed a very fair arrangement.",
    "If sometimes off his guard he played his makebelieve games aloud Nurse\nFrances never seemed to notice or to think it unusual.",
    "She had the same calm\ncomfortableness of old Nurse about her but she had something that mattered far\nmore to Vernon the gift of answering questions \u2013 and he knew instinctively\nthat the answers were always true.",
    "Sometimes she would say \u2018I don\u2019t know that\nmyself\u2019 or \u2018You must ask someone else.",
    "I\u2019m not clever enough to tell you that.\u2019\nThere was no pretence of omniscience about her.",
    "Sometimes after tea she would tell Vernon stories.",
    "The stories were never\nthe same two days running \u2013 one day they would be about naughty little boys\nand girls and the next day they would be about enchanted princesses.",
    "Vernon\nliked the latter kind best.",
    "There was one in particular that he loved about a\nprincess in a tower with golden hair and a vagabond prince in a ragged green hat.",
    "The story ended up in a forest and it was possibly for that reason that Vernon\nliked it so much.",
    "Sometimes there would be an extra listener.",
    "Myra used to come in and be\n\n\fwith Vernon during the early afternoon when Nurse Frances had her time off\nbut Vernon\u2019s father used sometimes to come in after tea when the stories were\ngoing on.",
    "Little by little it became a habit.",
    "Walter Deyre would sit in the\nshadows just behind Nurse Frances\u2019 chair and from there he would watch not\nhis child but the storyteller.",
    "One day Vernon saw his father\u2019s hand steal out and\nclose gently over Nurse Frances\u2019 wrist.",
    "And then something happened which surprised him very much.",
    "Nurse\nFrances got up from her chair.",
    "\u2018I\u2019m afraid we must turn you out for this evening Mr Deyre\u2019 she said\nquietly.",
    "\u2018Vernon and I have things to do.\u2019\nThis astonished Vernon very much because he couldn\u2019t think what those\nthings were.",
    "He was still more puzzled when his father got up also and said in a\nlow voice\n\u2018I beg your pardon.\u2019\nNurse Frances bent her head a little but remained standing.",
    "Her eyes met\nWalter Deyre\u2019s steadily.",
    "He said quietly\n\u2018Will you believe that I am really sorry and let me come tomorrow\u2019\nAfter that in some way that Vernon could not have defined his father\u2019s\nmanner was different.",
    "He no longer sat so near Nurse Frances.",
    "He talked more to\nVernon and occasionally they all three played a game \u2013 usually Old Maid for\nwhich Vernon had a wild passion.",
    "They were happy evenings enjoyed by all\nthree.",
    "One day when Nurse Frances was out of the room Walter Deyre said\nabruptly\n\u2018Do you like that Nurse of yours Vernon\u2019\n\u2018Nurse Frances I like her lots.",
    "Don\u2019t you Father\u2019\n\u2018Yes\u2019 said Walter Deyre \u2018I do.\u2019\nThere was a sadness in his voice which Vernon felt.",
    "\u2018Is anything the matter Father\u2019\n\u2018Nothing that can be put right.",
    "The horse that gets left at the post never has\nmuch chance of making good \u2013 and the fact that it\u2019s the horse\u2019s own fault\ndoesn\u2019t make matters any better.",
    "But that\u2019s double Dutch to you old man.",
    "Anyway enjoy your Nurse Frances while you\u2019ve got her.",
    "There aren\u2019t many of\nher sort knocking about.\u2019\nAnd then Nurse Frances came back and they played Animal Grab.",
    "But Walter Deyre\u2019s words had set Vernon\u2019s mind to work.",
    "He tackled Nurse\nFrances next morning.",
    "\u2018Aren\u2019t you going to be here always\u2019\n\u2018No.",
    "Only till you get well \u2013 or nearly well.\u2019\n\u2018Won\u2019t you stay always I\u2019d like you to.\u2019\n\u2018But you see that\u2019s not my work.",
    "My work is to look after people who are\nill.\u2019\n\u2018Do you like doing that\u2019\n\u2018Yes very much.\u2019\n\u2018Why\u2019\n\u2018Well you see everyone has some particular kind of work that they like\ndoing and that suits them.\u2019\n\u2018Mummy hasn\u2019t.\u2019\n\u2018Oh yes she has.",
    "Her work is to look after this big house and see that\neverything goes right and to take care of you and your father.\u2019\n\u2018Father was a soldier once.",
    "He told me that if ever there was a war he\u2019d go\nand be a soldier again.\u2019\n\u2018Are you very fond of your father Vernon\u2019\n\u2018I love Mummy best of course.",
    "Mummy says little boys always love their\nmothers best.",
    "I like being with Father of course but that\u2019s different.",
    "I expect it\u2019s\nbecause he\u2019s a man.",
    "What shall I be when I grow up do you think I want to be\na sailor.\u2019\n\u2018Perhaps you\u2019ll write books.\u2019\n\u2018What about\u2019\nNurse Frances smiled a little.",
    "\u2018Perhaps about Mr Green and Poodle and Squirrel and Tree.\u2019\n\u2018But everyone would say that that was silly.\u2019\n\u2018Little boys wouldn\u2019t think so.",
    "And besides when you grow up you will\nhave different people in your head \u2013 like Mr Green and the children only grown\nup people.",
    "And then you could write about them.\u2019\nVernon thought for a long time then he shook his head.",
    "\u2018I think I\u2019ll be a soldier like Father.",
    "Most of the Deyres have been soldiers\nMummy says.",
    "Of course you have to be very brave to be a soldier but I think I\nwould be brave enough.\u2019\nNurse Frances was silent a moment.",
    "She was thinking of what Walter Deyre\nhad said of his small son.",
    "\u2018He\u2019s a plucky little chap \u2013 absolutely fearless.",
    "Doesn\u2019t know what fear is\nYou should see him on his pony.\u2019\nYes Vernon was fearless enough in one sense.",
    "He had the power of\n\n\fendurance too.",
    "He had borne the pain and discomfort of his broken leg\nunusually well for so young a child.",
    "But there was another kind of fear.",
    "She said slowly after a minute or two\n\u2018Tell me again how you fell off the wall that day.\u2019\nShe knew all about The Beast and had been careful to display no ridicule.",
    "She listened now to Vernon and as he finished she said gently\n\u2018But you\u2019ve known for quite a long time haven\u2019t you that it isn\u2019t a real\nBeast That it\u2019s only a thing made of wood and wires.\u2019\n\u2018I do know\u2019 said Vernon.",
    "\u2018But I don\u2019t dream it like that.",
    "And when I saw it\nin the garden coming at me \u2013\u2019\n\u2018You ran away \u2013 which was rather a pity wasn\u2019t it It would have been\nmuch better to have stayed and looked.",
    "Then you\u2019d have seen the men and\nwould have known just what it was.",
    "It\u2019s always a good thing to look.",
    "Then you\ncan run away afterwards if you still want to \u2013 but you usually don\u2019t.",
    "And\nVernon I\u2019ll tell you something else.\u2019\n\u2018Yes\u2019\n\u2018Things are never so frightening in front of you as they are behind you.",
    "Remember that.",
    "Anything seems frightening when it\u2019s behind your back and you\ncan\u2019t see it.",
    "That\u2019s why it\u2019s always better to turn and face things \u2013 and then very\noften you find they are nothing at all.\u2019\nVernon said thoughtfully \u2018If I\u2019d turned round I wouldn\u2019t have broken my\nleg would I\u2019\n\u2018No.\u2019\nVernon sighed.",
    "\u2018I don\u2019t mind having broken my leg very much.",
    "It has been very nice having\nyou to play with.\u2019\nHe thought Nurse Frances murmured \u2018Poor child\u2019 under her breath but that\nof course was absurd.",
    "She said smiling\n\u2018I\u2019ve enjoyed it too.",
    "Some of my ill people don\u2019t like to play.\u2019\n\u2018You really do like playing don\u2019t you\u2019 said Vernon.",
    "\u2018So does Mr Green.\u2019\nHe added rather stiffly for he felt shy\n\u2018Please don\u2019t go away very soon will you\u2019\n\n4\nBut as it happened Nurse Frances went away much sooner than she might have\ndone.",
    "It all happened very suddenly as things in Vernon\u2019s experience always\n\n\fdid.",
    "It started very simply \u2013 something that Myra offered to do for Vernon and\nthat he said he would rather have done by Nurse Frances.",
    "He was on crutches now for a short and painful time every day enjoying the\nnovelty of it very much.",
    "He soon got tired however and was ready to go back to\nbed.",
    "Today his mother had suggested his doing so saying she would help him.",
    "But Vernon had been helped by her before.",
    "Those big white hands of hers were\nstrangely clumsy.",
    "They hurt where they meant to help.",
    "He shrank from her wellmeant efforts.",
    "He said he would wait for Nurse Frances who never hurt.",
    "The words came out with the tactless honesty of children and in a minute\nMyra Deyre was at white heat.",
    "Nurse Frances came in two or three minutes later to be received with a flood\nof reproach.",
    "Turning the boy against his own mother \u2013 cruel \u2013 wicked \u2013 They were all\nalike \u2013 everyone was against her \u2013 She had nothing in the world but Vernon and\nnow he was being turned against her too.",
    "So it went on \u2013 a ceaseless stream.",
    "Nurse Frances bore it patiently enough\nwithout surprise or rancour.",
    "Mrs Deyre she knew was that kind of woman.",
    "Scenes were a relief to her.",
    "And hard words Nurse Frances reflected with grim\nhumour can only harm if the utterer is dear to you.",
    "She was sorry for Myra\nDeyre for she realized how much real unhappiness and misery lay behind these\nhysterical outbursts.",
    "It was an unfortunate moment for Walter Deyre to choose to enter the\nnursery.",
    "For a moment or two he stood surprised then he flushed angrily.",
    "\u2018Really Myra I\u2019m ashamed of you.",
    "You don\u2019t know what you\u2019re saying.\u2019\nShe turned on him furiously.",
    "\u2018I know what I\u2019m saying well enough.",
    "And I know what you\u2019ve been doing.",
    "Slinking in here every day \u2013 I\u2019ve seen you.",
    "Always making love to some woman\nor other.",
    "Nursemaids hospital nurses \u2013 it\u2019s all one to you.\u2019\n\u2018Myra \u2013 be quiet\u2019\nHe was really angry now.",
    "Myra Deyre felt a throb of fear.",
    "But she hurled her\nlast piece of invective.",
    "\u2018You\u2019re all alike you hospital nurses.",
    "Flirting with other women\u2019s husbands.",
    "You ought to be ashamed of yourself \u2013 before the innocent child too \u2013 putting all\nsorts of things into his head.",
    "But you\u2019ll go out of my house.",
    "Yes you\u2019ll go right\nout \u2013 and I shall tell Dr Coles what I think of you.\u2019\n\u2018Would you mind continuing this edifying scene elsewhere\u2019 Her husband\u2019s\n\n\fvoice was as she hated it most \u2013 cold and sneering.",
    "\u2018Hardly judicious in front of\nyour innocent child is it I apologize Nurse for what my wife has been saying.",
    "Come Myra.\u2019\nShe went \u2013 beginning to cry \u2013 weakly frightened at what she had done.",
    "As\nusual she had said more than she meant.",
    "\u2018You\u2019re cruel\u2019 she sobbed.",
    "\u2018Cruel.",
    "You\u2019d like me to be dead.",
    "You hate me.\u2019\nShe followed him out of the room.",
    "Nurse Frances put Vernon to bed.",
    "He\nwanted to ask questions but she talked of a dog a big St Bernard that she had\nhad when she was a little girl and he was so much interested that he forgot\neverything else.",
    "Much later that evening Vernon\u2019s father came to the nursery.",
    "He looked\nwhite and ill. Nurse Frances rose and came to where he stood in the doorway.",
    "\u2018I don\u2019t know what to say \u2013 how can I apologize \u2013 the things my wife said \u2013\u2019\nNurse Frances replied in a quiet matteroffact voice.",
    "\u2018Oh it\u2019s quite all right.",
    "I understand.",
    "I think though that I had better go as\nsoon as it can be arranged.",
    "My being here makes Mrs Deyre unhappy and then\nshe works herself up.\u2019\n\u2018If she knew how wide of the mark her wild accusations are.",
    "That she should\ninsult you \u2013\u2019\nNurse Frances laughed \u2013 not perhaps very convincingly.",
    "\u2018I always think it\u2019s absurd when people complain about being insulted\u2019 she\nsaid cheerfully.",
    "\u2018Such a pompous word isn\u2019t it Please don\u2019t worry or think I\nmind.",
    "You know Mr Deyre your wife is \u2013\u2019\n\u2018Yes\u2019\nHer voice changed.",
    "It was grave and sad.",
    "\u2018A very unhappy and lonely woman.\u2019\n\u2018Do you think that is entirely my fault\u2019\nThere was a pause.",
    "She lifted her eyes \u2013 those steady green eyes.",
    "\u2018Yes\u2019 she said \u2018I do.\u2019\nHe drew a long breath.",
    "\u2018No one else but you would have said that to me.",
    "You \u2013 I suppose it\u2019s\ncourage in you that I admire so much \u2013 your absolute fearless honesty.",
    "I\u2019m sorry\nfor Vernon that he should lose you before he need.\u2019\nShe said gravely\n\u2018Don\u2019t blame yourself for things you needn\u2019t.",
    "This has not been your fault.\u2019\n\u2018Nurse Frances.\u2019 It was Vernon eagerly from bed.",
    "\u2018I don\u2019t want you to go\naway.",
    "Don\u2019t go away please \u2013 not tonight.\u2019\n\n\f\u2018Of course not\u2019 said Nurse Frances.",
    "\u2018We\u2019ve got to talk to Dr Coles about it.\u2019\nNurse Frances left three days later.",
    "Vernon wept bitterly.",
    "He had lost the first\nreal friend he had ever had.",
    "Chapter Five\n1\nThe years from five to nine remained somewhat dim in Vernon\u2019s memory.",
    "Things changed \u2013 but so gradually as not to matter.",
    "Nurse did not return to her\nreign over the nursery.",
    "Her mother had had a stroke and was quite helpless and\nshe was obliged to remain and look after her.",
    "Instead a Miss Robbins was installed as Nursery Governess.",
    "A creature so\nextraordinarily colourless that Vernon could never afterwards even recall what\nshe looked like.",
    "He must have become somewhat out of hand under her regime\nfor he was sent to school just after his eighth birthday.",
    "On his first holidays he\nfound his cousin Josephine installed.",
    "On her few visits to Abbots Puissants Nina had never brought her small\ndaughter with her.",
    "Indeed her visits had become rarer and rarer.",
    "Vernon\nknowing things without thinking about them as children do was perfectly well\naware of two facts.",
    "One that his father did not like Uncle Sydney but was\nalways exceedingly polite to him.",
    "Two that his mother did not like Aunt Nina\nand did not mind showing it.",
    "Sometimes when Nina was sitting talking to Walter in the garden Myra\nwould join them and in the momentary pause that nearly always followed she\nwould say\n\u2018I suppose I\u2019d better go away again.",
    "I see I\u2019m in the way.",
    "No thank you\nWalter\u2019 this in answer to a protest gently murmured.",
    "\u2018I can see plainly enough\nwhen I\u2019m not wanted.\u2019\nShe would move away biting her lip nervously clasping and unclasping her\nhands tears in her brown eyes.",
    "And very quietly Walter Deyre would raise his\neyebrows.",
    "One day Nina broke out\n\u2018She\u2019s impossible I can\u2019t speak to you for ten minutes without an absurd\nscene.",
    "Walter why did you do it Why did you do it\u2019\nVernon remembered how his father had looked round gazing up at the\nhouse then letting his eyes sweep far afield to where the ruins of the old Abbey\n\n\fjust showed.",
    "\u2018I cared for the place\u2019 he said slowly.",
    "\u2018In the blood I suppose.",
    "I didn\u2019t want\nto let it go.\u2019\nThere had been a brief silence and then Nina had laughed \u2013 a queer short\nlaugh.",
    "\u2018We\u2019re not a very satisfactory family\u2019 she said.",
    "\u2018We\u2019ve made a pretty good\nmess of things you and I.\u2019\nThere was another pause and then his father had said\n\u2018Is it as bad as that\u2019\nNina had drawn in her breath with a sharp hiss she nodded.",
    "\u2018Pretty well.",
    "I don\u2019t think Walter that I can go on much longer.",
    "Fred hates\nthe sight of me.",
    "Oh we behave very prettily in public \u2013 no one would guess \u2013\nbut my God when we\u2019re alone\u2019\n\u2018Yes but my dear girl \u2013\u2019\nAnd then for a while Vernon heard no more.",
    "Their voices were lowered his\nfather seemed to be arguing with his aunt.",
    "Finally his voice rose again.",
    "\u2018You can\u2019t take a mad step like that.",
    "It\u2019s not even as though you cared for\nAnstey.",
    "You don\u2019t.\u2019\n\u2018I suppose not \u2013 but he\u2019s crazy about me.\u2019\nHis father said something that sounded like \u2018Social Ostriches\u2019.",
    "Nina laughed\nagain.",
    "\u2018That We\u2019d neither of us care.\u2019\n\u2018Anstey would in the end.\u2019\n\u2018Fred would divorce me \u2013 only too glad of the chance.",
    "Then we could\nmarry.\u2019\n\u2018Even then \u2013\u2019\n\u2018Walter on the social conventions It has its humorous side\u2019\n\u2018Women and men are very different\u2019 said Vernon\u2019s father drily.",
    "\u2018Oh I know \u2013 I know.",
    "But anything\u2019s better than this everlasting misery.",
    "Of\ncourse at the bottom of it all is that I still care for Fred \u2013 I always did.",
    "And he\nnever cared for me.\u2019\n\u2018There\u2019s the kid\u2019 said Walter Deyre.",
    "\u2018You can\u2019t go off and leave her.\u2019\n\u2018Can\u2019t I I\u2019m not much of a mother you know.",
    "As a matter of fact I\u2019d take\nher with me.",
    "Fred wouldn\u2019t care.",
    "He hates her as much as he hates me.\u2019\nThere was another pause a long one this time.",
    "Then Nina said slowly\n\u2018What a ghastly tangle human beings can get themselves into.",
    "And in your\ncase and mine Walter it\u2019s all our own fault.",
    "We\u2019re a nice family We bring bad\n\n\fluck to ourselves and to anyone we have anything to do with.\u2019\nWalter Deyre got up.",
    "He filled a pipe abstractedly then moved slowly away.",
    "For the first time Nina noticed Vernon.",
    "\u2018Hallo child\u2019 she said.",
    "\u2018I didn\u2019t see you were there.",
    "How much did you\nunderstand of all that I wonder\u2019\n\u2018I don\u2019t know\u2019 said Vernon vaguely shifting from foot to foot.",
    "Nina opened a chain bag took out a tortoiseshell case and extracted a\ncigarette which she proceeded to light.",
    "Vernon watched her fascinated.",
    "He had\nnever seen a woman smoke.",

    "\u2018Mummy says\u2019 said Vernon \u2018that no nice woman would ever smoke.",

    "She puffed out a cloud of smoke.",
    "\u2018I expect she was\nquite right.",
    "I\u2019m not a nice woman you see Vernon.\u2019\nVernon looked at her vaguely distressed.",
    "\u2018I think you\u2019re very pretty\u2019 he said rather shyly.",
    "\u2018That\u2019s not the same thing\u2019 Nina\u2019s smile widened.",
    "\u2018Come here Vernon.\u2019\nHe came obediently.",
    "Nina put her hands on his shoulders and looked him\nover quizzically.",
    "He submitted patiently.",
    "He never minded being touched by\nAunt Nina.",
    "Her hands were light \u2013 not clutching like his mother\u2019s.",
    "\u2018Yes\u2019 said Nina.",
    "\u2018You\u2019re a Deyre \u2013 very much so.",
    "Rough luck on Myra but\nthere it is.\u2019\n\u2018What does that mean\u2019 said Vernon.",
    "\u2018It means that you\u2019re like your father\u2019s family and not like your mother\u2019s \u2013\nworse luck for you.\u2019\n\u2018Why worse luck for me\u2019\n\u2018Because the Deyres Vernon are neither happy nor successful.",
    "And they\ncan\u2019t make good.\u2019\nWhat funny things Aunt Nina said She said them half laughingly so\nperhaps she didn\u2019t mean them.",
    "And yet somehow \u2013 there was something in them\nthat though he didn\u2019t understand made him afraid.",
    "\u2018Would it be better\u2019 he said suddenly \u2018to be like Uncle Sydney\u2019\n\u2018Much better.",
    "Much better.\u2019\nVernon considered.",
    "\u2018But then\u2019 he said slowly \u2018if I was like Uncle Sydney \u2013\u2019\nHe stopped trying to get his thoughts into words.",
    "\u2018Yes well\u2019\n\n\f\u2018If I was Uncle Sydney I should have to live at Larch Hurst \u2013 and not here.\u2019\nLarch Hurst was a stoutly built red brick villa near Birmingham where\nVernon had once been taken to stay with Uncle Sydney and Aunt Carrie.",
    "It had\nthree acres of superb pleasure grounds a rose garden a pergola a goldfish tank\nand two excellently fitted bathrooms.",
    "\u2018And wouldn\u2019t you like that\u2019 asked Nina still watching him.",

    "He only carried away a couple of phrases \u2018It\u2019s that poor child I\u2019m so\nsorry for.",
    "You\u2019ve only got to look at Nina to see she\u2019s a bad lot and always will\nbe.\u2019\nThe poor child Vernon knew was his cousin Josephine whom he had never\nseen but to whom he sent presents at Christmas and duly received them in\nreturn.",
    "He wondered why Josephine was \u2018poor\u2019 and why his mother was sorry\nfor her and also why Aunt Nina was a bad lot \u2013 whatever that meant.",
    "He asked\nMiss Robbins who got very pink and told him he mustn\u2019t talk about \u2018things like\nthat\u2019.",

    "Vernon was silent.",
    "But he was puzzled.",
    "What was blasphemous He rather\n\n\fthought that it was the same word Cook had used speaking of her brother.",
    "She\nhad said he was a most \u2013 something \u2013 man and hardly ever touched a drop She\nhad spoken as though such an attitude was highly commendable.",

    "But he did not make the mistake Myra would have done of\nthinking the child unfeeling.",
    "They had reached the ruins of the Abbey.",
    "The sun was just setting.",
    "Father\nand son looked round and Walter Deyre drew in his breath with a little intake of\npain.",

    "These were the things that one didn\u2019t put into words.",
    "Odd how\n\n\fstrangely at home he felt with that small person his son.",
    "Perhaps it had been a\nmistake not to have got to know the boy better.",
    "They might have had some good\ntimes together.",
    "He was shy of the boy \u2013 and the boy was shy of him.",
    "And yet\nsomehow they were curiously in harmony.",
    "They both of them disliked saying\nthings \u2013 \u2018I\u2019m fond of the old place\u2019 said Walter Deyre.",
    "\u2018I expect you will be\ntoo.\u2019\n\u2018Yes Father.\u2019\n\u2018Queer to think of the old monks \u2013 catching their fish \u2013 fat fellows \u2013 that\u2019s\nhow I always think of them \u2013 comfortable chaps.\u2019\nThey lingered a few minutes longer.",

    "Well it would soon be over.",
    "Goodbyes were painful things \u2013 better if one made\nno fuss about them but then of course Myra would never see it that way.",
    "Poor Myra.",
    "She\u2019d had a rotten deal on the whole.",
    "A finelooking creature\nbut he\u2019d married her really for the sake of Abbots Puissants \u2013 and she had\nmarried him for love.",
    "That was the root of the whole trouble.",
    "\u2018Look after your mother Vernon\u2019 he said suddenly.",
    "\u2018She\u2019s been very good\nto you you know.\u2019\nHe rather hoped in a way that he wouldn\u2019t come back.",
    "It would be best so.",
    "Vernon had his mother.",
    "And yet at that thought he had a queer traitorous feeling.",
    "As though he were\ndeserting the boy \u2026\n\n4\n\u2018Walter\u2019 cried Myra \u2018you haven\u2019t said goodbye to Vernon.\u2019\nWalter looked across at his son standing there wideeyed.",

    "How queer they were \u2013 the Deyres.",
    "So casual.",
    "Strange the way\nthey had nodded to each other across the width of the room.",
    "So alike \u2026\n\u2018But Vernon\u2019 said Myra to herself \u2018shall not grow up like his father.\u2019\nOn the walls around her Deyres looked down and smiled sardonically \u2026\n\n\fChapter Seven\n1\nTwo months after his father sailed for South Africa Vernon went to school.",
    "It\nhad been Walter Deyre\u2019s wish and arrangement and Myra at the moment was\ndisposed to regard any wish of his as law.",
    "He was her soldier and her hero and\neverything else was forgotten.",
    "She was thoroughly happy at this time.",
    "Knitting\nsocks for the soldiers urging on energetic campaigns of \u2018white feather\u2019\nsympathizing and talking with other women whose husbands had also gone to\nfight the wicked ungrateful Boers.",
    "She felt exquisite pangs parting with Vernon.",
    "Her darling \u2013 her baby \u2013 to go\nso far away from her.",
    "What sacrifices mothers had to make But it had been his\nfather\u2019s wish.",
    "Poor darling he was sure to be most terribly homesick She couldn\u2019t bear to\nthink of it.",

    "He had a good temperament for school life.",
    "He had an aptitude for games a\nquiet manner and an unusual amount of physical courage.",
    "After the dull\nmonotony of life under the reign of Miss Robbins school was a delightful\nnovelty.",
    "Like all the Deyres he had the knack of getting on with people.",
    "He\nmade friends easily.",
    "But the reticence of the child who so often answered \u2018Nothing\u2019 clung to him.",
    "Except with one or two people that reticence was to go through life with him.",
    "His school friends were people with whom he shared \u2018doing things\u2019.",
    "His\nthoughts he was to keep to himself and share with only one person.",
    "That person\ncame into his life very soon.",
    "On his very first holidays he found Josephine.",

    "\u2018Yes.",

    "Why should one say things\n\u2018She\u2019s in the schoolroom darling.",
    "Go and find her and make friends.\u2019\nVernon went slowly.",
    "He didn\u2019t know whether he was pleased or not.",
    "A girl\nHe was at the age to despise girls.",
    "Rather a nuisance having a girl about.",
    "On the\nother hand it would be jolly having someone.",
    "It depended what the kid was like.",

    "\u2018Don\u2019t tell Aunt Myra\u2019 said Joe.",

    "When he was twentyone \u2026\n\n\fBook Two\nNell\n\n\fChapter One\n1\nThe room was full of cigarette smoke.",
    "It eddied and drifted about forming a thin\nblue haze.",
    "Through it came the sound of three voices occupied with the\nbetterment of the human race and the encouragement of art \u2013 especially art that\ndefied all known conventions.",
    "Sebastian Levinne leaning back against the ornate marble mantelpiece of his\nmother\u2019s town house spoke didactically gesticulating with the long yellow hand\nthat held his cigarette.",
    "The tendency to lisp was still there but very faint.",
    "His\nyellow Mongolian face his surprised looking ears were much the same as they\nhad been at eleven years old.",
    "At twentytwo he was the same Sebastian sure of\nhimself perceptive with the same love of beauty and the same unemotional and\nunerring sense of values.",
    "In front of him reclining in two immense leather covered armchairs were\nVernon and Joe.",
    "Very much alike these two cast in the same sharply\naccentuated black and white mould.",
    "But as of old Joe\u2019s was the more\naggressive personality energetic rebellious vehement.",
    "Vernon an immense\nlength lay back slothfully in his chair.",
    "His long legs rested on the back of\nanother chair.",
    "He was blowing smoke rings and smiling thoughtfully to himself.",
    "He occasionally contributed grunts to the conversation or a short lazy sentence.",

    "I hate it.\u2019\nSebastian said calmly \u2018That\u2019s because you\u2019ve got such an incurably\nromantic view of life.",
    "You like poets to starve in garrets and artists to toil\nunrecognized and sculptors to be applauded after they are dead.\u2019\n\u2018Well \u2013 that\u2019s what happens.",
    "Always\u2019\n\u2018No not always.",

    "That\u2019s my point.",
    "The world never likes anything new \u2013 but I say it could be\nmade to.",
    "Taken the right way it could be made to.",

    "\u2018That\u2019s what you mean.",
    "Well we Jews have\ngot taste \u2013 we know when a thing is fine and when it isn\u2019t.",

    "Sebastian went on.",
    "\u2018There are two sides to what we\u2019re talking about \u2013 there are people who are\nthinking of new things new ways of doing old things new thoughts altogether \u2013\nand who can\u2019t get their chance because people are afraid of anything new.",
    "And\nthere are the other people \u2013 the people who know what the public have always\nwanted and who go on giving it to them because it\u2019s safe and there\u2019s a sure\nprofit.",
    "But there\u2019s a third way \u2013 to find things that are new and beautiful and\ntake a chance on them.",
    "That\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do.",
    "I\u2019m going to run a picture\ngallery in Bond Street \u2013 I signed the deeds yesterday \u2013 and a couple of theatres \u2013\nand later I want to run a weekly of some kind on entirely different lines from\nanything that has been done before.",
    "And what\u2019s more I\u2019m going to make the\nwhole thing pay.",
    "There are all sorts of things that I admire that a cultivated few\nwould admire \u2013 but I\u2019m not going out for those.",
    "Anything I run\u2019s going to be a\npopular success.",
    "Dash it all Joe don\u2019t you see that half the fun of the thing is\nmaking it pay It\u2019s justifying yourself by success.\u2019\nJoe shook her head unconvinced.",
    "\u2018Are you really going to have all those things\u2019 said Vernon.",
    "Both the cousins looked at Sebastian with a tinge of envy.",
    "Queer and rather\nwonderful to be in old Sebastian\u2019s position.",
    "His father had died some years\nbefore.",
    "Sebastian at twentytwo was master of so many millions that it took\none\u2019s breath away to think about them.",
    "The friendship with Sebastian begun all those years ago at Abbots Puissants\nhad endured and strengthened.",
    "He and Vernon had been friends at Eton they\nwere at the same college at Cambridge.",
    "In the holidays the three had always\nmanaged to spend a good deal of time together.",
    "\u2018What about sculpture\u2019 asked Joe suddenly.",

    "Are you still keen about taking up modelling\u2019\n\u2018Rather.",
    "It\u2019s the only thing I really care about.\u2019\nA derisive hoot of laughter came from Vernon.",
    "\u2018Yes and what will it be this time next year You\u2019ll be a frenzied poet or\nsomething.\u2019\n\u2018It takes one some time to find one\u2019s true vocation\u2019 said Joe with dignity.",

    "\u2018However thank heaven you\u2019ve given up\nthat damned violin.\u2019\n\u2018Why do you hate music so Vernon\u2019\n\u2018Dunno \u2013 I always have.\u2019\nJoe turned back to Sebastian.",
    "Unconsciously her voice took on a different\nnote.",
    "It sounded ever so faintly constrained.",
    "\u2018What do you think of Paul La Marre\u2019s work Vernon and I went to his\nstudio last Sunday.\u2019\n\u2018No guts\u2019 said Sebastian succinctly.",

    "As though you had been pretending for years\nand now you needn\u2019t pretend any more.",
    "I\u2019ve been horribly afraid of music \u2013\nalways.",
    "Now \u2013\u2019\nHe sat up squared his shoulders.",

    "I\u2019m going to know the ins and outs\nof every instrument.",
    "By the way there must be more instruments in the world \u2013\nmany more.",
    "There ought to be a kind of waily thing \u2013 I\u2019ve heard it somewhere.",
    "You\u2019d want ten \u2013 fifteen of those.",
    "And about fifty harps \u2013\u2019\nHe sat there planning composedly details that to Joe sounded sheer\nnonsense.",
    "Yet it was evident that to his inner vision some event was perfectly\nclear.",
    "\u2018It\u2019ll be supper time in ten minutes\u2019 Joe reminded him timidly.",
    "\u2018Oh Will it What a nuisance.",
    "I want to stay here and think and hear things\nin my head.",
    "Tell Aunt Ethel I\u2019ve got a headache or that I\u2019ve been frightfully\nsick.",
    "As a matter of fact I think I am going to be sick.\u2019\nAnd somehow that impressed Joe more than anything else.",
    "It was a homely\nfamiliar happening.",
    "When anything upset you very much either pleasurably or\notherwise you always wanted to be sick She had felt that herself often.",
    "She stood in the door hesitating.",
    "Vernon had relapsed into abstraction again.",
    "How queer he looked \u2013 quite different.",
    "As though \u2013 as though \u2013 Joe sought for\nthe words she wanted \u2013 as though he had suddenly come alive.",
    "She was a little frightened.",
    "Chapter Two\n1\nCarey Lodge was the name of Myra\u2019s house.",
    "It was about eight miles from\nBirmingham.",
    "A subtle depression always weighed down Vernon\u2019s spirits as he got near\nCarey Lodge.",
    "He hated the house hated its solid comfort its thick bright red\ncarpets its lounge hall the carefully selected sporting prints that hung in the\ndiningroom the superabundance of knickknacks that filled the drawingroom.",
    "And yet was it so much those things he hated as the facts that stood behind\nthem\nHe questioned himself trying for the first time to be honest with himself.",
    "Wasn\u2019t it the truth that he hated his mother being so at home there so placidly\ncontent He liked to think of her in terms of Abbots Puissants \u2013 liked to think of\nher as being like himself an exile.",
    "And she wasn\u2019t Abbots Puissants had been to her what a foreign kingdom\nmight be to a Queen Consort.",
    "She had felt important there and pleased with\nherself.",
    "It had been new and exciting.",
    "But it hadn\u2019t been home.",
    "Myra greeted her son with extravagant affection as always.",
    "He wished she\nwouldn\u2019t.",
    "In some way it made it harder than ever for him to respond.",
    "When he\nwas away from her he pictured himself being affectionate to his mother.",
    "When\nhe was with her all that illusion faded away.",
    "Myra Deyre had altered a good deal since leaving Abbots Puissants.",
    "She had\ngrown much stouter.",
    "Her beautiful golden red hair was flecked with grey.",
    "The\nexpression of her face was different it was at once more satisfied and more\nplacid.",
    "There was now a strong resemblance between her and her brother\nSydney.",
    "\u2018You\u2019ve had a good time in London I\u2019m so glad.",
    "It\u2019s so exciting to have my\nfine big son back with me \u2013 I\u2019ve been telling everybody how excited I am.",
    "Mothers are foolish creatures aren\u2019t they\u2019\nVernon thought they were rather \u2013 then was ashamed of himself.",
    "\u2018Very jolly to see you Mother\u2019 he mumbled.",
    "Joe said\n\u2018You\u2019re looking splendidly fit Aunt Myra.\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019ve not really been very well dear.",
    "I don\u2019t think Dr Grey quite understands\nmy case.",
    "I hear there\u2019s a new doctor \u2013 Dr Littleworth \u2013 just bought Dr\nArmstrong\u2019s practice.",
    "They say he is wonderfully clever.",
    "I\u2019m sure it\u2019s my heart \u2013\nand it\u2019s all nonsense Dr Grey saying it\u2019s indigestion.\u2019\nShe was quite animated.",
    "Her health was always an absorbing topic to Myra.",
    "\u2018Mary\u2019s gone \u2013 the housemaid you know.",
    "I was really very disappointed in\nthat girl.",
    "After all I did for her.\u2019\nIt went on and on.",
    "Joe and Vernon listened perfunctorily.",
    "Their minds were\nfull of conscious superiority.",
    "Thank Heaven they belonged to a new and\nenlightened generation far above this insistence on domestic details.",
    "For them a\nnew and splendid world opened out.",
    "They were deeply poignantly sorry for the\ncontented creature who sat there chattering to them.",
    "Joe thought\n\u2018Poor \u2013 poor Aunt Myra.",
    "So terribly female Of course Uncle Walter got\nbored with her.",
    "Not her fault A rotten education and brought up to believe that\ndomesticity was all that mattered.",
    "And here she is still young really \u2013 at least\nnot too terribly old \u2013 and all she\u2019s got to do is to sit in the house and gossip and\nthink about servants and fuss about her health.",
    "If she\u2019d only been born twenty\nyears later she could have been happy and free and independent all her life.\u2019\nAnd out of her intense pity for her unconscious aunt she answered gently\nand pretended an interest that she certainly did not feel.",
    "Vernon thought\n\u2018Was Mother always like this Somehow she didn\u2019t seem so at Abbots\nPuissants.",
    "Or was I too much of a kid to notice It\u2019s rotten of me to criticize her\nwhen she\u2019s been so good to me always.",
    "Only I wish she wouldn\u2019t treat me still\nas though I were about six years old.",
    "Oh well I suppose she can\u2019t help it.",
    "I don\u2019t\nthink I shall ever marry \u2013\u2019\nAnd suddenly he jerked out abruptly urged thereto by intense nervousness.",
    "\u2018I say Mother.",
    "I\u2019m thinking of taking Music at Cambridge.\u2019\nThere it was out He had said it.",
    "Myra distracted from her account of the Armstrongs\u2019 cook said vaguely\n\u2018But darling you always were so unmusical.",
    "You used to be quite\nunreasonable about it.\u2019\n\u2018I know\u2019 said Vernon gruffly.",
    "\u2018But one changes one\u2019s mind about things\nsometimes.\u2019\n\n\f\u2018Well I\u2019m very glad dear.",
    "I used to play quite brilliant pieces myself when I\nwas a young girl.",
    "But one never keeps up anything when one marries.\u2019\n\u2018I know.",
    "It\u2019s a wicked shame\u2019 said Joe hotly.",
    "\u2018I don\u2019t mean to marry \u2013 but if\nI did I\u2019d never give up my own career.",
    "And that reminds me Aunt Myra I\u2019ve\njust got to go to London to study if I\u2019m ever going to be any good at modelling.\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019m sure Mr Bradford \u2013\u2019\n\u2018Oh damn Mr Bradford I\u2019m sorry Aunt Myra but you don\u2019t understand.",
    "I\u2019ve got to study \u2013 hard.",
    "And I must be on my own.",
    "I could share diggings with\nanother girl \u2013\u2019\n\u2018Joe darling don\u2019t be so absurd.\u2019 Myra laughed.",
    "\u2018I need my little Joe here.",
    "I\nalways look on you as my daughter you know Joe dear.\u2019\nJoe wriggled.",
    "\u2018I really am in earnest Aunt Myra.",
    "It\u2019s my whole life.\u2019\nThis tragic utterance only made her aunt laugh more.",
    "\u2018Girls often think like that.",
    "Now don\u2019t let\u2019s spoil this happy evening by\nquarrelling.\u2019\n\u2018But will you really seriously consider it\u2019\n\u2018We must see what Uncle Sydney says.\u2019\n\u2018It\u2019s nothing to do with him.",
    "He\u2019s not my uncle.",
    "Surely if I like I can take\nmy own money \u2013\u2019\n\u2018It isn\u2019t exactly your own money Joe.",
    "Your father sends it to me as an\nallowance for you \u2013 though I\u2019m sure I would be willing to have you without any\nallowance at all \u2013 and knows you are well and safely looked after with me.\u2019\n\u2018Then I suppose I\u2019d better write to Father.\u2019\nShe said it valiantly but her heart sank.",
    "She had seen her father twice in ten\nyears and the old antagonism held between them.",
    "The present plan doubtless\ncommended itself to Major Waite.",
    "At the cost of a few hundreds a year the\nproblem of his daughter was lifted off his hands.",
    "But Joe had no money of her\nown.",
    "She doubted very much if her father would make her any allowance at all if\nshe broke away from Aunt Myra and insisted on leading her own life.",
    "Vernon murmured to her\n\u2018Don\u2019t be so damned impatient Joe.",
    "Wait till I\u2019m twentyone.\u2019\nThat cheered her a little.",
    "One could always depend on Vernon.",
    "Myra asked Vernon about the Levinnes.",
    "Was Mrs Levinne\u2019s asthma any\nbetter Was it true that they spent almost all of their time in London nowadays\n\u2018No I don\u2019t think so.",
    "Of course they don\u2019t go down to Deerfields much in\nthe winter but they were there all the autumn.",
    "It\u2019ll be jolly to have them next\n\n\fdoor when we go back to Abbots Puissants won\u2019t it\u2019\nHis mother started and said in a flustered sort of voice\n\u2018Oh yes \u2013 very nice.\u2019\nShe added almost immediately\n\u2018Your Uncle Sydney is coming round to tea.",
    "He\u2019s bringing Enid.",
    "By the way\nI don\u2019t have late dinner any more.",
    "I really think it suits me better to have a good\nsit down meal at six.\u2019\n\u2018Oh\u2019 said Vernon rather taken aback.",
    "He had an unreasoning prejudice against those meals.",
    "He disliked the\njuxtaposition of tea and scrambled eggs and rich plum cake.",
    "Why couldn\u2019t his\nmother have proper meals like other people Of course Uncle Sydney and Aunt\nCarrie always had high tea.",
    "Bother Uncle Sydney All this was his fault.",
    "His thought stopped \u2013 checked.",
    "All what He couldn\u2019t answer \u2013 didn\u2019t quite\nknow.",
    "But anyway when he and his mother went back to Abbots Puissants\neverything would be different.",
    "2\nUncle Sydney arrived very soon \u2013 very bluff and hearty a little stouter than of\nold.",
    "With him came Enid his third daughter.",
    "The two eldest were married and\nthe two youngest were in the schoolroom.",
    "Uncle Sydney was full of jokes and fun.",
    "Myra looked at her brother\nadmiringly.",
    "Really there was nobody like Syd He made things go.",
    "Vernon laughed politely at his uncle\u2019s jokes which he privately thought both\nstupid and boring.",
    "\u2018I wonder where you buy your tobacco in Cambridge\u2019 said Uncle Sydney.",
    "\u2018From a pretty girl I\u2019ll be bound.",
    "Ha Ha Myra the boy\u2019s blushing \u2013 actually\nblushing.\u2019\n\u2018Stupid old fool\u2019 thought Vernon disdainfully.",
    "\u2018And where do you buy your tobacco Uncle Sydney\u2019 said Joe valiantly\nentering the lists.",
    "\u2018Ha Ha\u2019 trumpeted Uncle Sydney.",
    "\u2018That\u2019s a good one You\u2019re a smart girl\nJoe.",
    "We won\u2019t tell your Aunt Carrie the answer to that eh\u2019\nEnid said very little but giggled a good deal.",
    "\u2018You ought to write to your cousin\u2019 said Uncle Sydney.",
    "\u2018He\u2019d like a letter\nwouldn\u2019t you Vernon\u2019\n\u2018Rather\u2019 said Vernon.",
    "\u2018There you are\u2019 said Uncle Sydney.",
    "\u2018What did I tell you miss The child\nwanted to but was shy.",
    "She\u2019s always thought a lot of you Vernon.",
    "But I mustn\u2019t\ntell tales out of school hey Enid\u2019\nLater after the heavy composite meal was ended he talked to Vernon at\nsome length of the prosperity of Bent\u2019s.",
    "\u2018Booming my boy booming.\u2019\nHe went into long financial explanations profits had doubled he was\nextending the premises \u2013 and so on and so on.",
    "Vernon much preferred this style of conversation.",
    "Not being the least\ninterested he could abstract his attention.",
    "An encouraging monosyllable was all\nthat was needed from time to time.",
    "Uncle Sydney talked on developing the fascinating theme of the Power and\nGlory of Bent\u2019s World without End Amen.",
    "Vernon thought about the book on musical instruments which he had bought\nthat morning and read coming down in the train.",
    "There was a terrible lot to\nknow.",
    "Oboes \u2013 he felt he was going to have ideas about oboes.",
    "And violas \u2013 yes\ncertainly violas.",
    "Uncle Sydney\u2019s talk made a pleasant accompaniment like a remote double\nbass.",
    "Presently Uncle Sydney said he must be getting along.",
    "There was more\nfacetiousness \u2013 should or should not Vernon kiss Enid good night\nHow idiotic people were.",
    "Thank goodness he\u2019d soon be able to get up to his\nown room.",
    "Myra heaved a happy sigh as the door closed.",
    "\u2018Dear me\u2019 she murmured \u2018I wish your father had been here.",
    "We\u2019ve had\nsuch a happy evening.",
    "He would have enjoyed it.\u2019\n\u2018A jolly good thing he wasn\u2019t\u2019 said Vernon.",
    "\u2018I don\u2019t remember he and Uncle\nSydney ever hitting it off really well.\u2019\n\u2018You were only a little boy.",
    "They were the greatest of friends and your\nfather was always happy when I was.",
    "Oh dear how happy we were together.\u2019\nShe raised a handkerchief to her eyes.",
    "Vernon stared at her.",
    "For a moment he\nthought \u2018This is the most magnificent loyalty.\u2019 And then suddenly \u2018No it isn\u2019t.",
    "She really believes it.\u2019\nMyra went on in a soft reminiscent tone.",
    "\u2018You were never really fond of your father Vernon.",
    "I think it must have\ngrieved him sometimes.",
    "But then you were so devoted to me.",
    "It was quite\nridiculous.\u2019\n\n\fVernon said suddenly and violently and with a strange feeling that he was\ndefending his father by saying so\n\u2018Father was a brute to you.\u2019\n\u2018Vernon how dare you say such a thing.",
    "Your father was the best man in the\nworld.\u2019\nShe looked at him defiantly.",
    "He thought \u2018She\u2019s seeing herself being heroic.",
    "\u201cHow wonderful a woman\u2019s love can be \u2013 protecting her dead\u201d \u2013 that sort of\nthing.",
    "Oh I hate it all.",
    "I hate it all.\u2019\nHe mumbled something kissed her and went up to bed.",
    "3\nLater in the evening Joe tapped at his door and was bidden to enter.",
    "Vernon was\nsitting sprawled out in a chair.",
    "The book on musical instruments lay on the floor\nbeside him.",
    "\u2018Hallo Joe.",
    "God what a beastly evening\u2019\n\u2018Did you mind it so much\u2019\n\u2018Didn\u2019t you It\u2019s all wrong.",
    "What an ass Uncle Sydney is.",
    "Those idiotic\njokes It\u2019s all so cheap.\u2019\n\u2018H\u2019m\u2019 said Joe.",
    "She sat down thoughtfully on the bed and lit a cigarette.",
    "\u2018Don\u2019t you agree\u2019\n\u2018Yes \u2013 at least I do in a way.\u2019\n\u2018Spit it out\u2019 said Vernon encouragingly.",
    "\u2018Well what I mean is they\u2019re happy enough.\u2019\n\u2018Who\u2019\n\u2018Aunt Myra.",
    "Uncle Sydney.",
    "Enid.",
    "They\u2019re a united happy lot thoroughly\ncontent with one another.",
    "It\u2019s we who are wrong Vernon.",
    "You and I. We\u2019ve\nlived here all these years \u2013 but we don\u2019t belong.",
    "That\u2019s why \u2013 we\u2019ve got to get\nout of it.\u2019\nVernon nodded thoughtfully.",
    "\u2018Yes Joe you\u2019re right.",
    "We\u2019ve got to get out of it.\u2019\nHe smiled happily because the way was so clear.",
    "Twentyone \u2026 Abbots Puissants \u2026 Music \u2026\n\n\fChapter Three\n1\n\u2018Do you mind just going over that once more Mr Flemming\u2019\n\u2018Willingly.\u2019\nPrecise dry even word after word fell from the old lawyer\u2019s lips.",
    "His\nmeaning was clear and unmistakable Too much so It didn\u2019t leave a loophole\nfor doubt.",
    "Vernon listened.",
    "His face was very white his hands grasped the arms of the\nchair in which he was sitting.",
    "It couldn\u2019t be true \u2013 it couldn\u2019t And yet after all hadn\u2019t Mr Flemming said\nvery much the same years ago Yes but then there had been the magic words\n\u2018twentyone\u2019 to look forward to.",
    "\u2018Twentyone\u2019 which by a blessed miracle was\nto make everything right.",
    "Instead of which\n\u2018Mind you the position is infinitely improved from what it was at the time of\nyour father\u2019s death but it is no good pretending we are out of the wood.",
    "The\nmortgage \u2013\u2019\nSurely surely they had never mentioned a mortgage Well it wouldn\u2019t have\nbeen much use he supposed to a boy of nine.",
    "No good trying to get round it.",
    "The plain truth was that he couldn\u2019t afford to live at Abbots Puissants.",
    "He waited till Mr Flemming had finished and then said\n\u2018But if my Mother \u2013\u2019\n\u2018Oh of course.",
    "If Mrs Deyre were prepared to \u2013\u2019 He left the sentence\nunfinished paused and then added \u2018But if I may say so every time that I have\nhad the pleasure of seeing Mrs Deyre she has seemed to me to be very settled \u2013\nvery settled indeed.",
    "I suppose you know that she bought the freehold of Carey\nLodge two years ago\u2019\nVernon hadn\u2019t known it.",
    "He saw plainly enough what it meant.",
    "Why hadn\u2019t\nhis mother told him Hadn\u2019t she had the courage He had always taken it for\ngranted that she would come back with him to Abbots Puissants not so much\nbecause he longed for her presence there as because it was \u2013 quite naturally \u2013\nher home.",
    "But it wasn\u2019t her home.",
    "It never could be in the sense that Carey Lodge was\nher home.",
    "He could appeal to her of course.",
    "Beg her for his sake because he wanted it\nso much.",
    "No a thousand times no You couldn\u2019t beg favours from people you didn\u2019t\nreally love.",
    "And he didn\u2019t really love his mother.",
    "He didn\u2019t believe he ever really\nhad.",
    "Queer and sad and a little dreadful but there it was.",
    "If he never saw her again would he mind Not really.",
    "He would like to know\nthat she was well and happy \u2013 cared for.",
    "But he wouldn\u2019t miss her would never\nfeel a longing for her presence.",
    "Because in a queer way he didn\u2019t really like her.",
    "He disliked the touch of her hands always had to take a hold on himself before\nkissing her good night.",
    "He\u2019d never been able to tell her anything \u2013 she never\nunderstood or knew what he was feeling.",
    "She had been a good loving mother \u2013\nand he didn\u2019t even like her Rather horrible he supposed most people would\nsay \u2026\nHe said quietly to Mr Flemming\n\u2018You are quite right.",
    "I am sure my mother would not wish to leave Carey\nLodge.\u2019\n\u2018Now there are one or two alternatives open to you Mr Deyre.",
    "Major\nSalmon who as you know has rented it furnished all these years is anxious to\nbuy \u2013\u2019\n\u2018No\u2019 The word burst from Vernon like a pistol shot.",
    "Mr Flemming smiled.",
    "\u2018I was sure you would say that.",
    "And I must confess I am glad.",
    "There have\nbeen \u2013 er \u2013 Deyres at Abbots Puissants for let me see nearly five hundred years.",
    "Nevertheless I should be failing in my duty if I didn\u2019t point out to you that the\nprice offered is a good one and that if later you should decide to sell it may\nnot be easy to find a suitable purchaser.\u2019\n\u2018It\u2019s out of the question.\u2019\n\u2018Very good.",
    "Then the best thing I think is to try and let once more.",
    "Major\nSalmon definitely wants to buy a place so it will mean finding a new tenant.",
    "But\nI dare say we shall have no great difficulty.",
    "The point is how long do you want\nto let for To let the place for another long term of years is I should say not\nvery desirable.",
    "Life is very uncertain.",
    "Who knows in a few years the state of\naffairs may have \u2013 er \u2013 changed very considerably and you may be in a position\nto take up residence there yourself.\u2019\n\u2018So I shall but not the way you think you old dunderhead\u2019 thought Vernon.",
    "\u2018It\u2019ll be because I\u2019ve made a name for myself in music \u2013 not because Mother is\ndead.",
    "I\u2019m sure I hope she\u2019ll live to be ninety.\u2019\nHe exchanged a few more words with Mr Flemming then rose to go.",
    "\u2018I\u2019m afraid this has been rather a shock to you\u2019 said the old lawyer as he\nshook hands.",
    "\u2018Yes \u2013 just a bit.",
    "I\u2019ve been building castles in the air I suppose.\u2019\n\u2018You\u2019re going down to spend your twentyfirst birthday with your mother I\nsuppose\u2019\n\u2018Yes.\u2019\n\u2018You might talk things over with your uncle Mr Bent.",
    "A very shrewd man of\nbusiness.",
    "He has a daughter about your age I think\u2019\n\u2018Yes Enid.",
    "The two eldest are married and the two youngest are at school.",
    "Enid\u2019s about a year younger than I am.\u2019\n\u2018Ah very pleasant to have a cousin of one\u2019s own age.",
    "I dare say you will see\na good deal of her.\u2019\n\u2018Oh I don\u2019t suppose I shall\u2019 said Vernon vaguely.",
    "Why should he be seeing a lot of Enid She was a dull girl.",
    "But of course Mr\nFlemming didn\u2019t know that.",
    "Funny old chap.",

    "I wondered what it was all about\u2019\n\u2018Oh nothing interesting.",
    "Some people you don\u2019t know.\u2019\nShe looked rather red and confused.",
    "Vernon wasn\u2019t curious.",
    "He asked no more.",
    "He missed Joe most frightfully.",
    "Carey Lodge was pretty deadly without her.",
    "For one thing he saw more of Enid than he had ever done before.",

    "She was so persistent about it that Vernon gave in.",
    "After all it didn\u2019t\nmatter.",
    "Sebastian would have Joe and he himself didn\u2019t much care.",
    "Dancing was\nrather rot \u2013 everything was rot that interfered with music \u2026\nThe evening before his departure Uncle Sydney came to Carey Lodge and\nMyra pushed Vernon into the study with him and said\n\u2018Your Uncle Sydney\u2019s come to have a little talk with you Vernon.\u2019\nMr Bent hemmed and hawed for a minute or two and then rather\nsurprisingly came straight to the point.",
    "Vernon had never liked his uncle as\nmuch.",
    "His facetious manner had been entirely laid aside.",

    "Now\nremember what I said \u2013 no interruptions I know you\u2019ve never thought of such a\nthing and I dare say the idea isn\u2019t very congenial to you now.",

    "That would be a shame.",
    "Well there\u2019s the offer.\u2019\n\u2018It\u2019s most awfully good of you Uncle Sydney \u2013\u2019 began Vernon.",
    "His uncle threw up a large square hand and stopped him.",

    "\u2018Kind of you to ask Enid up for May week.",
    "Very excited about it she is.",
    "If\nyou knew what that girl thought of you Vernon you\u2019d be quite conceited.",
    "Ah\nwell girls will be girls.\u2019\nLaughing boisterously he slammed the front door.",
    "Vernon remained in the hall frowning.",
    "It was really jolly decent of Uncle\nSydney \u2013 jolly decent.",
    "Not that he was going to accept.",
    "All the money in the\nworld wouldn\u2019t tear him from music \u2026\nAnd somehow he would have Abbots Puissants as well.",
    "3\nMay week\nJoe and Enid were at Cambridge.",
    "Vernon had been let in for Ethel too as\nchaperon.",
    "The world seemed largely composed of Bents just at present.",
    "Joe had burst out at once with \u2018Why on earth did you ask Enid\u2019\nHe had answered \u2018Oh Mother went on about it \u2013 it doesn\u2019t really matter.\u2019\nNothing mattered to Vernon just then except one thing.",
    "Joe talked privately\nto Sebastian about that.",
    "\u2018Is Vernon really in earnest about this music business Will he ever be any\ngood I suppose it\u2019s just a passing craze\u2019\nBut Sebastian was unexpectedly serious.",
    "\u2018It\u2019s extraordinarily interesting you know\u2019 he said.",
    "\u2018As far as I can make\n\n\fout what Vernon is aiming at is something entirely revolutionary.",
    "He\u2019s\nmastering now what you might call the main facts and mastering them at an\nextraordinary rate.",
    "Old Coddington admits that though of course he snorts at\nVernon\u2019s ideas \u2013 or would if Vernon ever let out about them.",
    "The person who\u2019s\ninterested is old Jeffries \u2013 mathematics He says Vernon\u2019s ideas of music are\nfourth dimensional.",
    "\u2018I don\u2019t know if Vernon will ever pull it off \u2013 or whether he\u2019ll be considered\nas a harmless lunatic.",
    "The borderline is very narrow I imagine.",
    "Old Jeffries is\nvery enthusiastic.",
    "But not in the least encouraging.",
    "He points out quite rightly\nthat to attempt to discover something new and force it on the world is always a\nthankless task and that in all probability the truths that Vernon is discovering\nwon\u2019t be accepted for at least another two hundred years.",
    "He\u2019s a queer old\ncodger.",
    "Sits about thinking of imaginary curves in space \u2013 that sort of thing.",
    "\u2018But I see his point.",
    "Vernon isn\u2019t creating something new.",
    "He\u2019s discovering\nsomething that\u2019s already there.",
    "Rather like a scientist.",
    "Jeffries says that Vernon\u2019s\ndislike of music as a child is perfectly understandable \u2013 to his ear music\u2019s\nincomplete \u2013 it\u2019s like a picture out of drawing.",
    "The whole perspective is wrong.",
    "It sounds to Vernon like \u2013 I suppose \u2013 a primitive savage\u2019s music would sound\nto us \u2013 mostly unendurable discord.",
    "\u2018Jeffries is full of queer ideas.",
    "Start him off on squares and cubes and\ngeometrical figures and the speed of light and he goes quite mad.",
    "He writes to a\nGerman fellow called Einstein.",
    "The queer thing is that he isn\u2019t a bit musical and\nyet he can see \u2013 or says he can \u2013 exactly what Vernon is driving at.\u2019\nJoe cogitated deeply.",
    "\u2018Well\u2019 she said at last \u2018I don\u2019t understand a word of all this.",
    "But it looks as\nthough Vernon might make a success of it all.\u2019\nSebastian was discouraging.",
    "\u2018I wouldn\u2019t say that.",
    "Vernon may be a genius \u2013 and that\u2019s quite a different\nthing.",
    "Nobody welcomes genius.",
    "On the other hand he may be just slightly mad.",
    "He sounds mad enough sometimes when he gets going \u2013 and yet somehow I\u2019ve\nalways got a kind of feeling that he\u2019s right \u2013 that in some odd way he knows\nwhat he\u2019s talking about.\u2019\n\u2018You\u2019ve heard about Uncle Sydney\u2019s offer\u2019\n\u2018Yes.",
    "Vernon seems to be turning it down very lightheartedly and yet you\nknow it\u2019s a good thing.\u2019\n\u2018You wouldn\u2019t have him accept it\u2019 flamed out Joe.",
    "Sebastian remained provokingly cool.",
    "\u2018I don\u2019t know.",
    "It needs thinking about.",
    "Vernon may have wonderful theories\nabout this music business \u2013 there\u2019s nothing to show that he\u2019s ever going to be\nable to put them into practice.\u2019\n\u2018You\u2019re maddening\u2019 said Joe turning away.",
    "Sebastian annoyed her nowadays.",
    "All his cool analytical faculties seemed to\nbe uppermost.",
    "If he had enthusiasms he hid them carefully.",
    "And to Joe just now enthusiasm seemed the most necessary thing in the\nworld.",
    "She had a passion for lost causes for minorities.",
    "She was a passionate\nchampion of the weak and oppressed.",
    "Sebastian she felt was only interested in successes.",
    "She accused him in her\nown mind of judging everyone and everything from a monetary standard.",
    "Most\nof the time they were together they fought and bickered incessantly.",
    "Vernon too seemed separated from her.",
    "Music was the only thing he wanted\nto talk about and even then on lines that were not familiar to her.",
    "His preoccupation was entirely with instruments \u2013 their scope and power\nand the violin which Joe herself played seemed the instrument in which he was\nleast interested.",
    "Joe was quite unfitted to talk about clarinets trombones and\nbassoons.",
    "Vernon\u2019s ambition in life seemed to be to form friendships with\nplayers of these instruments so as to be able to acquire some practical as opposed\nto theoretical knowledge.",
    "\u2018Don\u2019t you know any bassoon players\u2019\nJoe said she didn\u2019t.",
    "Vernon said that she might as well make herself useful and try to pick up\nsome musical friends.",
    "\u2018Even a French horn would do\u2019 he said kindly.",
    "He drew an experimental finger round the edge of his fingerbowl.",
    "Joe\nshuddered and clapped both hands to her ears.",
    "The sound increased in volume.",
    "Vernon smiled dreamily and ecstatically.",
    "\u2018One ought to be able to catch that and harness it.",
    "I wonder how it could be\ndone.",
    "It\u2019s a lovely round sound isn\u2019t it Like a circle.\u2019\nSebastian took the fingerbowl forcibly away from him and he wandered\nround the room and rang various goblets experimentally.",
    "\u2018Nice lot of glasses in this room\u2019 he said appreciatively.",
    "\u2018You\u2019re drowning sailors\u2019 said Joe.",
    "\u2018Can\u2019t you be satisfied with bells and a triangle\u2019 asked Sebastian.",
    "\u2018And a\nlittle gong to beat \u2013\u2019\n\u2018No\u2019 said Vernon.",
    "\u2018I want glass \u2026 Let\u2019s have the Venetian and the\nWaterford together \u2026 I\u2019m glad you have these aesthetic tastes Sebastian.",
    "Have\n\n\fyou got a common glass that I can smash \u2013 all the tinkling fragments.",
    "Wonderful\nstuff \u2013 glass\u2019\n\u2018Symphony of goblets\u2019 said Joe scathingly.",
    "\u2018Well why not I suppose somebody once pulled a bit of catgut tight and\nfound it made a squawky noise and somebody once blew through a reed and\nliked it.",
    "I wonder when they first thought of making things of brass and metal \u2013 I\ndare say some book tells you \u2013\u2019\n\u2018Columbus and the egg.",
    "You and Sebastian\u2019s glass goblets.",
    "Why not a slate\nand a slate pencil.\u2019\n\u2018If you\u2019ve got one \u2013\u2019\n\u2018Isn\u2019t he too funny\u2019 giggled Enid.",
    "And that stopped the conversation \u2013 for\nthe time at any rate.",
    "Not that Vernon really minded her presence.",
    "He was far too wrapped up in\nhis ideas to be sensitive about them.",
    "Enid and Ethel were welcome to laugh as\nmuch as they chose.",
    "But he was slightly disturbed by the lack of harmony between Joe and\nSebastian.",
    "The three of them had always been such a united trio.",
    "\u2018I don\u2019t think this \u201cliving your own life\u201d stunt agrees with Joe\u2019 said Vernon\nto his friend.",
    "\u2018She\u2019s like an angry cat most of the time.",
    "I can\u2019t think why Mother\nagreed.",
    "She was dead against it about six months ago.",

    "\u2018What\u2019\n\u2018I shan\u2019t say.",
    "In the first place I may be wrong and in the second place I\nshould hate to interfere with the possibly normal course of events.\u2019\n\u2018That\u2019s your tortuous Russian mind.\u2019\n\u2018I dare say.\u2019\nVernon didn\u2019t insist.",
    "He was much too lazy to probe for reasons that weren\u2019t\ngiven him.",
    "Day succeeded day.",
    "They danced breakfasted drove at incredibly fast\nspeeds through the countryside sat and smoked and talked in Vernon\u2019s rooms\ndanced again.",

    "At five in the morning they\nwent on the river.",
    "Vernon\u2019s right arm ached.",
    "Enid fell to his share and she was a heavy partner.",
    "Well it didn\u2019t matter.",
    "Uncle Sydney had seemed pleased and he was a decent\nold boy.",
    "Jolly good of him to make that offer.",
    "What a pity it was that he \u2013\n\n\fVernon \u2013 was not more of a Bent and less of a Deyre.",
    "A vague memory stirred in his mind \u2013 somebody saying \u2018The Deyres\nVernon are neither happy nor successful.",
    "They can\u2019t make good \u2013\u2019 Who was it\nwho had said that A woman\u2019s voice it had been in a garden \u2013 and there had\nbeen curling cigarette smoke.",

    "Always\nchattering and talking and giggling \u2013 and asking you what you were thinking of\nwhen all you wanted was to be let alone.",
    "He always remembered feeling that as a kid.",

    "Mrs Vereker\u2019s reasonableness was extremely\ndisconcerting being so unexpected.",
    "\u2018But as I say I\u2019m not going to forbid the banns.",
    "What I do stipulate is that\nNell should be thoroughly sure that she really knows her own mind.",
    "You agree\nto that I\u2019m sure\u2019\nVernon agreed to that with an uneasy feeling of being entangled in a mesh\nfrom which he was presently not going to be able to escape.",

    "\u2018Why not\u2019 said Joe valiantly.",
    "\u2018I don\u2019t know.",
    "Everything I\u2019ve done just lately is rotten.",
    "I started all right.",
    "But now I\u2019m stale as stale.",
    "I\u2019m tired before I start.\u2019\n\u2018I suppose that\u2019s because you work all day.\u2019\n\u2018I suppose it is.\u2019\n\n\fHe was silent for a minute or two and then said\n\u2018It\u2019ll be wonderful meeting Radmaager.",
    "He\u2019s one of the only men who write\nwhat I call music.",
    "I wish I could talk to him about what I really think \u2013 but it\nwould be such awful cheek.\u2019\nThe party was of an informal character.",
    "Sebastian had a large studio empty\nsave for a dais a grand piano and a large quantity of cushions thrown down at\nrandom about the floor.",
    "At one end was a hastily put trestle table and on this\nwere piled viands of all descriptions.",
    "You collected what you wanted and then pitched your cushion.",
    "When Joe\nand Vernon arrived a girl was dancing \u2013 a small redhaired girl with a lithe\nsinewy body.",
    "Her dancing was ugly but alluring.",
    "She finished to loud applause and leapt down from the dais.",
    "\u2018Bravo Anita\u2019 said Sebastian.",
    "\u2018Now then Vernon and Joe have you got\nwhat you want That\u2019s right.",
    "You\u2019d better sink down gracefully by Jane.",
    "This is\nJane.\u2019\nThey sank down as bidden.",
    "Jane was a tall creature with a beautiful body and\na mass of very dark brown hair coiled low on her neck.",
    "Her face was too broad\nfor beauty and her chin too sharp.",
    "Her eyes were deep set and green.",
    "She was\nabout thirty Vernon thought.",
    "He found her disconcerting but attractive.",
    "Joe began to talk to her eagerly.",
    "Her enthusiasm for sculpture had been\nwaning of late.",
    "She had always had a high soprano voice and she was now\ncoquetting with the idea of becoming an opera singer.",
    "Jane Harding listened sympathetically enough emitting a faintly amused\nmonosyllable from time to time.",
    "Finally she said\n\u2018If you like to come round to my flat I\u2019ll try your voice and I can tell you in\ntwo minutes just what your voice is good for.\u2019\n\u2018Would you really That\u2019s awfully kind of you.\u2019\n\u2018Oh not at all.",
    "You can trust me.",
    "You can\u2019t trust someone who makes their\nliving by teaching to tell you the truth.\u2019\nSebastian came up and said\n\u2018What about it Jane\u2019\nShe got up from the floor \u2013 rather a beautiful movement.",
    "Then looking\nround she said in the curt voice of command one would use to a dog\n\u2018Mr Hill.\u2019\nA small man rather like a white worm bustled forward with an ingratiating\ntwist of the body.",
    "He followed her up to the dais.",
    "She sang a French song Vernon had never heard before.",
    "\u2018J\u2019ai perdu mon amie \u2013 elle est morte\nTout s\u2019en va cette fois pour jamais\nPour jamais pour toujours elle emporte\nLe dernier des amours que j\u2019aimais.",
    "\u2018Pauvre nous Rien ne m\u2019a crie l\u2019heure\nOu la bas se nouait son linceuil\nOn m\u2019a dit \u201cElle est morte\u201d Et tout seul\nJe r\u00e9p\u00e8te \u201cElle est morte\u201d Et je pleure \u2026\u2019\n\nLike most people who heard Jane Harding sing Vernon was quite unable to\ncriticize the voice.",
    "She created an emotional atmosphere \u2013 the voice was only an\ninstrument.",
    "The sense of overwhelming loss of dazed grief the final relief of\ntears.",
    "There was applause.",
    "Sebastian murmured\n\u2018Enormous emotional power \u2013 that\u2019s it.\u2019\nShe sang again.",
    "This time it was a Norwegian song about falling snow.",
    "There\nwas no emotion in her voice whatsoever \u2013 it was like the white flakes of the\nsnow \u2013 monotonous exquisitely clear finally dying away to silence on the last\nline.",
    "In response to applause she sang yet a third song.",
    "Vernon sat up suddenly\nalert.",
    "\u2018I saw a fairy lady there\nWith long white hands and drowning hair\nAnd oh her face was wild and sweet\nWas sweet and wild and wild and strange and fair \u2026\u2019\n\nIt was like a spell laid on the room \u2013 the sense of magic \u2013 of terrified\nenchantment.",
    "Jane\u2019s face was thrust forward.",
    "Her eyes looked out past beyond \u2013\nseeing \u2013 frightened yet fascinated.",
    "There was a sigh as she finished.",
    "A stout burly man with white hair en brosse\npushed his way to Sebastian.",
    "\u2018Ah my good Sebastian I have arrived.",
    "I will talk to that young lady \u2013 at\nonce immediately.\u2019\nSebastian went with him across the room to Jane.",
    "Herr Radmaager took her\nby both hands.",
    "He looked at her earnestly.",
    "\u2018Yes\u2019 he said at last.",
    "\u2018Your physique is good.",
    "I should say that both the\ndigestion and the circulation were excellent.",
    "You will give me your address and I\nwill come and see you.",
    "Is it not so\u2019\nVernon thought \u2018These people are mad.\u2019\n\n\fBut he noticed that Jane Harding seemed to take it as a matter of course.",
    "She\nwrote down her address talked to Radmaager for a few minutes longer then\ncame and rejoined Joe and Vernon.",
    "\u2018Sebastian is a good friend\u2019 she remarked.",
    "\u2018He knows that Herr Radmaager\nis looking for a Solveig for his new opera Peer Gynt.",
    "That is why he asked me\nhere tonight.\u2019\nJoe got up and went to talk to Sebastian.",
    "Vernon and Jane Harding were left\nalone.",
    "\u2018Tell me\u2019 said Vernon stammering a little.",
    "\u2018That song you sang \u2013\u2019\n\u2018Frosted snow\u2019\n\u2018No the last one.",
    "I \u2013 I heard it years ago \u2013 when I was a kid.\u2019\n\u2018How curious.",
    "I thought it was a family secret.\u2019\n\u2018A hospital nurse sang it to me when I broke my leg.",
    "I always loved it \u2013 but\nnever thought I should hear it again.\u2019\nJane Harding said thoughtfully\n\u2018I wonder now.",
    "Could that have been my Aunt Frances\u2019\n\u2018Yes that was her name.",
    "Nurse Frances.",
    "Was she your aunt What\u2019s\nhappened to her\u2019\n\u2018She died a good many years ago.",
    "Diphtheria caught from a patient.\u2019\n\u2018Oh I\u2019m sorry.\u2019 He paused hesitated then blundered on.",
    "\u2018I\u2019ve always\nremembered her.",
    "She was \u2013 she was a wonderful friend to me as a kid.\u2019\nHe caught Jane\u2019s green eyes looking at him a steady kindly glance and he\nknew at once of whom she had reminded him the first moment he saw her.",
    "She\nwas like Nurse Frances.",
    "She said quietly\n\u2018You write music don\u2019t you Sebastian told me about you.\u2019\n\u2018Yes \u2013 at least I try to.\u2019\nHe stopped hesitated again.",
    "He thought \u2018She\u2019s terribly attractive.",
    "Do I like\nher Why am I afraid of her\u2019\nHe felt suddenly excited and exalted.",
    "He could do things \u2013 he knew he could\ndo things \u2026\n\u2018Vernon\u2019\nSebastian was calling him.",
    "He got up.",
    "Sebastian presented him to\nRadmaager.",
    "The great man was kindly and sympathetic.",
    "\u2018I am interested\u2019 he said \u2018in what I hear about your work from my young\nfriend here.\u2019 He laid his hand on Sebastian\u2019s shoulder.",
    "\u2018He is very astute my\nyoung friend.",
    "In spite of his youth he is seldom wrong.",
    "We will arrange a\n\n\fmeeting and you shall show me your work.\u2019\nHe moved on.",
    "Vernon was left quivering with excitement.",
    "Did he really\nmean it He went back to Jane.",
    "She was smiling.",
    "Vernon sat down by her.",
    "A\nsudden wave of depression succeeded the exhilaration.",
    "What was the good of it\nall He was tied hand and foot to Uncle Sydney and Birmingham.",
    "You couldn\u2019t\nwrite music unless you gave your whole time your whole thoughts your whole\nsoul to it.",
    "He felt injured \u2013 miserable \u2013 yearning for sympathy.",
    "If only Nell were here.",
    "Darling Nell who always understood.",
    "He looked up and found Jane Harding watching him.",
    "\u2018What\u2019s the matter\u2019 she said.",
    "\u2018I wish I were dead\u2019 said Vernon bitterly.",
    "Jane raised her eyebrows slightly.",
    "\u2018Well\u2019 she said \u2018if you walk up to the top of this building and jump off you\ncan be.\u2019\nIt was hardly the answer that Vernon had expected.",
    "He looked up resentfully\nbut her cool kindly glance disarmed him.",
    "\u2018There\u2019s only one thing I care about in the whole world\u2019 he said\npassionately.",
    "\u2018I want to write music.",
    "I could write music.",
    "And instead of that I\u2019m\nstuck in a beastly business that I hate.",
    "Grinding away day after day It\u2019s too\nsickening.\u2019\n\u2018Why do you do it if you don\u2019t like it\u2019\n\u2018Because I have to.\u2019\n\u2018I expect you want to really \u2013 otherwise you wouldn\u2019t\u2019 said Jane\nindifferently.",
    "\u2018Haven\u2019t I told you that I want to write music more than anything else in the\nworld\u2019\n\u2018Then why don\u2019t you do it\u2019\n\u2018Because I can\u2019t I tell you.\u2019\nHe felt exasperated with her.",
    "She didn\u2019t seem to understand at all.",
    "Her view\non life seemed to be that if you wanted to do anything you just went and did it.",
    "He began pouring out things.",
    "Abbots Puissants the concert his uncle\u2019s offer\nand then \u2013 Nell \u2026\nWhen he had finished she said\n\u2018You do expect life to be rather a fairy story don\u2019t you\u2019\n\u2018What do you mean\u2019\n\u2018Just that.",
    "You want to be able to live in the house of your forefathers and to\n\n\fmarry the girl you love and to grow immensely rich and to be a great composer.",
    "I daresay you might manage to do one of those four things if you give your\nwhole mind to it.",
    "But it\u2019s not likely that you\u2019ll have everything you know.",
    "Life\nisn\u2019t like a penny novelette.\u2019\nHe hated her for the moment.",
    "And yet even while he hated he was attracted.",
    "He felt again the curious emotional atmosphere that she had created when\nsinging.",
    "He thought to himself \u2018A magnetic field that\u2019s what it is.\u2019 And then\nagain \u2018I don\u2019t like her.",
    "I\u2019m afraid of her.\u2019\nA longhaired young man came up and joined them.",
    "He was a Swede but he\nspoke excellent English.",
    "\u2018Sebastian tells me that you will write the music of the future\u2019 he said to\nVernon.",
    "\u2018I have theories about the future.",
    "Time is only another dimension of\nspace.",
    "You can move to and fro in time just as you can move to and fro in space.",
    "Half your dreams are only confused memories of the future.",
    "And as you can be\nseparated from your dear ones in space so you can be separated from them in\ntime and that is the greatest tragedy there is or can be.\u2019\nSince he was clearly mad Vernon paid no attention.",
    "He was not interested in\ntheories of space and time.",
    "But Jane Harding leaned forward.",
    "\u2018To be separated in time\u2019 she said.",
    "\u2018I never thought of that.\u2019\nEncouraged the Swede went on.",
    "He talked of time and of ultimate space\nand of time one and of time two.",
    "Whether Jane was interested or not Vernon\ndid not know.",
    "She looked straight in front of her and did not appear to be\nlistening.",
    "The Swede went on to time three and Vernon escaped.",
    "He joined Joe and Sebastian.",
    "Joe was being enthusiastic on the subject of\nJane Harding.",
    "\u2018I think she\u2019s wonderful.",
    "Don\u2019t you Vernon She\u2019s asked me to go and see\nher.",
    "I wish I could sing like that.\u2019\n\u2018She\u2019s an actress not a singer\u2019 said Sebastian.",
    "\u2018A good sort Jane.",
    "She\u2019s had\nrather a tragic life.",
    "For five years she lived with Boris Androv the sculptor.\u2019\nJoe glanced over in Jane\u2019s direction with enhanced interest.",
    "Vernon felt\nsuddenly young and crude.",
    "He could still see those enigmatical slightly mocking\ngreen eyes.",
    "He heard that amused ironical voice.",
    "\u2018You do expect life to be a fairy\nstory don\u2019t you\u2019 Hang it all that hurt\nAnd yet he had an immense desire to see her again.",
    "Should he ask her if he might \u2026\nNo he couldn\u2019t \u2026\nBesides he was so seldom in town \u2026\n\n\fHe heard her voice behind him \u2013 a singer\u2019s voice slightly husky.",
    "\u2018Good night Sebastian.",
    "Thank you.\u2019\nShe moved towards the door looked over her shoulder at Vernon.",
    "\u2018Come and see me some time\u2019 she said carelessly.",
    "\u2018Your cousin has got my\naddress.\u2019\n\n\fBook Three\nJane\n\n\fChapter One\n1\nJane Harding had a flat at the top of a block of mansions overlooking the river in\nChelsea.",
    "Here on the evening following the party came Sebastian Levinne.",
    "\u2018I\u2019ve fixed it up Jane\u2019 he said.",
    "\u2018Radmaager is coming here to see you some\ntime tomorrow.",
    "He prefers to do that it seems.\u2019\n\u2018Come tell me how you live he cried\u2019 quoted Jane.",
    "\u2018Well I\u2019m living very\nnicely and respectably entirely alone Do you want something to eat\nSebastian\u2019\n\u2018If there is anything\u2019\n\u2018There are scrambled eggs and mushrooms anchovy toast and black coffee if\nyou\u2019ll sit here peaceably while I get them.\u2019\nShe put the cigarette box and the matches beside him and left the room.",
    "In a\nquarter of an hour the meal was ready.",
    "\u2018I like coming to see you Jane\u2019 said Sebastian.",
    "\u2018You never treat me as a\nbloated young Jew to whom only the flesh pots of the Savoy would make\nappeal.\u2019\nJane smiled without speaking.",
    "Presently she said \u2018I like your girl Sebastian.\u2019\n\u2018Joe\u2019\n\u2018Yes Joe.\u2019\nSebastian said gruffly \u2018What \u2013 what do you really think of her\u2019\nAgain Jane paused before answering.",
    "\u2018So young\u2019 she said at last.",
    "\u2018So terribly young.\u2019\nSebastian chuckled.",
    "\u2018She\u2019d be very angry if she heard you.\u2019\n\u2018Probably.\u2019 After a minute she said \u2018You care for her very much don\u2019t you\nSebastian\u2019\n\u2018Yes.",
    "It\u2019s odd isn\u2019t it Jane how little all the things you\u2019ve got matter I\u2019ve\ngot practically all the things I want except Joe and Joe is all that matters.",
    "I can\n\n\fsee what a fool I am but it doesn\u2019t make a bit of difference What\u2019s the\ndifference between Joe and a hundred other girls Very little.",
    "And yet she\u2019s the\nonly thing in the world that matters to me just now.\u2019\n\u2018Partly because you can\u2019t get her.\u2019\n\u2018Perhaps.",
    "But I don\u2019t think that\u2019s so entirely.\u2019\n\u2018Neither do I.\u2019\n\u2018What do you think of Vernon\u2019 asked Sebastian after a pause.",
    "Jane changed her position shading her face from the fire.",
    "\u2018He\u2019s interesting\u2019 she said slowly \u2018partly I think because he is so\ncompletely unambitious.\u2019\n\u2018Unambitious do you think\u2019\n\u2018Yes.",
    "He wants things made easy.\u2019\n\u2018If so he\u2019ll never do anything in music.",
    "You want driving power for that.\u2019\n\u2018Yes you want driving power.",
    "But music will be the power that drives him\u2019\nSebastian looked up his face alight and appreciative.",
    "\u2018Do you know Jane\u2019 he said.",
    "\u2018I believe you\u2019re right\u2019\nShe smiled but made no answer.",
    "\u2018I wish I knew what to make of the girl he\u2019s engaged to\u2019 said Sebastian.",
    "\u2018What is she like\u2019\n\u2018Pretty.",
    "Some people might call it lovely \u2013 but I\u2019d call it pretty.",
    "She does the\nthings that other people do and does them very sweetly.",
    "She\u2019s not a cat.",
    "I\u2019m\nafraid \u2013 yes I am afraid now that she definitely cares for Vernon.\u2019\n\u2018You needn\u2019t be afraid.",
    "Your pet genius won\u2019t be turned aside or held down.",
    "That doesn\u2019t happen.",
    "I\u2019m more than ever sure every day I live that that doesn\u2019t\nhappen.\u2019\n\u2018Nothing would turn you aside Jane but then you have got driving power.\u2019\n\u2018And yet do you know Sebastian I believe I should be more easily \u201cturned\naside\u201d as you call it than your Vernon I know what I want and go for it \u2013 he\ndoesn\u2019t know what he wants or rather doesn\u2019t want it but it goes for him \u2026\nAnd that It whatever It is will be served \u2013 no matter at what cost.\u2019\n\u2018Cost to whom\u2019\n\u2018Ah I wonder \u2026\u2019\nSebastian rose.",

    "And I don\u2019t think success will ever spoil you.\u2019\n\u2018Oh success \u2013\u2019 He held out his hand.",
    "She laid both hands on his shoulders and kissed him.",
    "\u2018My dear I hope you will get your Joe.",
    "But if not I am quite sure you will get\neverything else\u2019\n\n2\nHerr Radmaager did not come to see Jane Harding for nearly a fortnight.",
    "He\narrived without warning of any kind at halfpast ten in the morning.",
    "He stumped\ninto the flat without a word of apology and looked round the walls of the sittingroom.",
    "\u2018It is you who have furnished and papered this Yes\u2019\n\u2018Yes.\u2019\n\u2018You live here alone\u2019\n\u2018Yes.\u2019\n\u2018But you have not always lived alone\u2019\n\u2018No.\u2019\nRadmaager said unexpectedly\n\u2018That is good.\u2019\nThen he said commandingly\n\u2018Come here.\u2019\nHe took her by both arms and drew her towards the window.",
    "There he\nlooked her over from head to foot.",
    "He pinched the flesh of her arm between\nfinger and thumb opened her mouth and looked down her throat and finally put\na large hand on each side of her waist.",
    "\u2018Breathe in \u2013 good Now out \u2013 sharply.\u2019\nHe took a tape measure out of his pocket made her repeat the two\nmovements passing the tape measure round her each time.",
    "Finally he pocketed it\nand put it away.",
    "Neither he nor Jane seemed to see anything curious in the\nproceedings.",
    "\u2018It is well\u2019 said Radmaager.",
    "\u2018Your chest is excellent your throat is strong.",
    "You are intelligent \u2013 since you have not interrupted me.",
    "I can find many singers\nwith a better voice than yours \u2013 your voice is very true very beautiful \u2013 very\nclear a silver thread.",
    "But if you force it it will go \u2013 and where will you be then\nI ask you The music you sing now is absurd \u2013 if you were not pigheaded as the\ndevil you would not sing those roles.",
    "Yet I respect you because you are an\nartist.\u2019\nHe paused then went on\n\n\f\u2018Now listen to me.",
    "My music is beautiful and it will not hurt your voice.",
    "When Ibsen created Solveig he created the most wonderful woman character\nthat has ever been created.",
    "My opera will stand and fall by its Solveig \u2013 and it is\nnot sufficient to have a singer.",

    "That is what your\nvoice must be like \u2013 the snow.",
    "It is white like damask \u2013 and the pattern runs\nthrough it.",
    "But the pattern is in the music not in your voice.\u2019\nHe went on playing.",

    "He stopped.",

    "\u2018How old\nare you\u2019\n\u2018Thirtythree.\u2019\n\u2018And you have been very unhappy \u2013 that is so\u2019\n\u2018Yes.\u2019\n\u2018How many men have you lived with\u2019\n\u2018One.\u2019\n\u2018And he was not a good man\u2019\nJane answered evenly\n\u2018He was a very bad one.\u2019\n\u2018I see.",
    "Yes it is that which is written in your face.",
    "Now listen to me all that\nyou have suffered all that you have enjoyed you will put it into my music not\nwith abandon not with unrestraint but with controlled and disciplined force.",
    "You have intelligence and you have courage.",
    "Without courage nothing can ever\nbe accomplished.",
    "Those without courage turn their backs on life.",
    "You will never\n\n\fturn your back on life.",
    "Whatever comes you will stand there facing it with your\nchin up and your eyes very steady \u2026 But I hope my child that you will not be\ntoo much hurt \u2026\u2019\nHe turned away.",
    "\u2018I will send on the score\u2019 he said over his shoulder.",
    "\u2018And you will study it.\u2019\nHe stumped out of the room and the flat door banged.",
    "Jane sat down by the table.",
    "She stared at the wall in front of her with\nunseeing eyes.",
    "Her chance had come.",
    "She murmured very softly to herself\n\u2018I\u2019m afraid.\u2019\n\n3\nFor a whole week Vernon debated the question of whether he should or should\nnot take Jane at her word.",
    "He could get up to town at the weekend \u2013 but then\nperhaps Jane would be away.",
    "He felt miserably selfconscious and shy.",
    "Perhaps\nby now she had forgotten that she had asked him.",
    "He let the weekend go by.",
    "He felt that certainly by now she would have\nforgotten him.",
    "Then he got a letter from Joe in which she mentioned having seen\nJane twice.",
    "That decided Vernon.",
    "At six o\u2019clock on the following Saturday he\nrang the bell of Jane\u2019s flat.",
    "Jane herself opened it.",
    "Her eyes opened a little wider when she saw who it\nwas.",
    "Otherwise she displayed no surprise.",
    "\u2018Come in\u2019 she said.",
    "\u2018I\u2019m finishing my practising.",
    "But you won\u2019t mind.\u2019\nHe followed her into a long room whose windows overlooked the river.",
    "It\nwas very empty.",
    "A grand piano a divan a couple of chairs and walls that were\npapered with a wild riot of bluebells and daffodils.",
    "One wall alone was papered\nin sober dark green and on it hung a single picture \u2013 a queer study of bare tree\ntrunks.",
    "Something about it reminded Vernon of his early adventures in the\nForest.",
    "On the music stool was the little man like a white worm.",
    "Jane pushed a cigarette box towards Vernon said in her brutal commanding\nvoice \u2018Now Mr Hill\u2019 and began to walk up and down the room.",
    "Mr Hill flung himself upon the piano.",
    "His hands twinkled up and down it\nwith marvellous speed and dexterity.",
    "Jane sang.",
    "Most of the time sotto voce\nalmost under her breath.",
    "Occasionally she would take a phrase full pitch.",
    "Once\nor twice she stopped with an exclamation of what sounded like furious\n\n\fimpatience and Mr Hill was made to repeat from several bars back.",
    "She broke off quite suddenly by clapping her hands.",
    "She crossed to the\nfireplace pushed the bell and turning her head addressed Mr Hill for the first\ntime as a human being.",
    "\u2018You\u2019ll stay and have some tea won\u2019t you Mr Hill\u2019\nMr Hill was afraid he couldn\u2019t.",
    "He twisted his body apologetically several\ntimes and sidled out of the room.",
    "A maid brought in black coffee and hot\nbuttered toast which appeared to be Jane\u2019s conception of afternoon tea.",
    "\u2018What was that you were singing\u2019\n\u2018Electra \u2013 Richard Strauss.\u2019\n\u2018Oh I liked it.",
    "It was like dogs fighting.\u2019\n\u2018Strauss would be flattered.",
    "All the same I know what you mean.",
    "It is\ncombative.\u2019\nShe pushed the toast towards him and added\n\u2018Your cousin\u2019s been here twice.\u2019\n\u2018I know.",
    "She wrote and told me.\u2019\nHe felt tonguetied and uncomfortable.",
    "He had wanted so much to come and\nnow that he was here he didn\u2019t know what to say.",
    "Something about Jane made\nhim uncomfortable.",
    "He blurted out at last \u2018Tell me truthfully \u2013 would you\nadvise me to chuck work altogether and stick to music\u2019\n\u2018How can I possibly tell I don\u2019t know what you want to do.\u2019\n\u2018You spoke like that the other night.",
    "As though everyone can do just what\nthey like.\u2019\n\u2018So they can.",
    "Not always of course \u2013 but very nearly always.",
    "If you want to\nmurder someone there is really nothing to stop you.",
    "But you will be hanged\nafterwards \u2013 naturally.\u2019\n\u2018I don\u2019t want to murder anyone.\u2019\n\u2018No you want your fairy story to end happily.",
    "Uncle dies and leaves you all\nhis money.",
    "You marry your lady love and live at Abbots \u2013 whatever it\u2019s called \u2013\nhappily ever afterwards.\u2019\nVernon said angrily\n\u2018I wish you wouldn\u2019t laugh at me.\u2019\nJane was silent a minute then she said in a different voice \u2018I wasn\u2019t\nlaughing at you.",
    "I was doing something I\u2019d no business to do \u2013 trying to\ninterfere.\u2019\n\u2018What do you mean trying to interfere\u2019\n\u2018Trying to make you face reality and forgetting that you are \u2013 what \u2013 about\n\n\feight years younger than I am \u2013 and that your time for that hasn\u2019t yet come.\u2019\nHe thought suddenly \u2018I could say anything to her \u2013 anything at all.",
    "She\nwouldn\u2019t always answer the way I wanted her to though.\u2019\nAloud he said \u2018Please go on \u2013 I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s very egotistical my talking\nabout myself like this but I\u2019m so worried and unhappy.",
    "I want to know what you\nmeant when you said the other evening that of the four things I wanted I could\nget any one of them but not all together.\u2019\nJane considered a minute.",
    "\u2018What did I mean exactly Why just this.",
    "To get what you want you must\nusually pay a price or take a risk \u2013 sometimes both.",
    "For instance I love music \u2013\na certain kind of music.",
    "My voice is suitable for a totally different kind of music.",
    "It\u2019s an unusually good concert voice \u2013 not an operatic one \u2013 except for very light\nopera.",
    "But I\u2019ve sung in Wagner in Strauss \u2013 in all the things I like.",
    "I haven\u2019t\nexactly paid a price \u2013 but I take an enormous risk.",
    "My voice may give out any\nminute.",
    "I know that.",
    "I\u2019ve looked the fact in the face and I\u2019ve decided that the\ngame is worth the candle.",
    "\u2018Now in your case you mentioned four things.",
    "For the first I suppose that if\nyou remain in your uncle\u2019s business for a sufficient number of years you will\ngrow rich without any further trouble.",
    "That\u2019s not very interesting.",
    "Secondly you\nwant to live at Abbots Puissants \u2013 you could do that tomorrow if you married a\ngirl with money.",
    "Then the girl you\u2019re fond of the girl you want to marry \u2013\u2019\n\u2018Can I get her tomorrow\u2019 asked Vernon.",
    "He spoke with a kind of angry\nirony.",
    "\u2018I should say so \u2013 quite easily.\u2019\n\u2018How\u2019\n\u2018By selling Abbots Puissants.",
    "It is yours to sell isn\u2019t it\u2019\n\u2018Yes but I couldn\u2019t do that \u2013 I couldn\u2019t \u2013 I couldn\u2019t \u2026\u2019\nJane leaned back in her chair and smiled.",
    "\u2018You prefer to go on believing that life is a fairy story\u2019\n\u2018There must be some other way.\u2019\n\u2018Yes of course there is another.",
    "Probably the simplest.",
    "There\u2019s nothing to\nstop you both going out to the nearest Registry Office.",
    "You\u2019ve both got the use\nof your limbs.\u2019\n\u2018You don\u2019t understand.",
    "There are hundreds of difficulties in the way.",
    "I\ncouldn\u2019t ask Nell to face a life of poverty.",
    "She doesn\u2019t want to be poor.\u2019\n\u2018Perhaps she can\u2019t.\u2019\n\u2018What do you mean by can\u2019t\u2019\n\n\f\u2018Just that.",
    "Can\u2019t.",
    "Some people can\u2019t be poor you know.\u2019\nVernon got up walked twice up and down the room.",
    "Then he came back\ndropped on the hearthrug beside Jane\u2019s chair and looked up at her.",
    "\u2018What about the fourth thing Music Do you think I could ever do that\u2019\n\u2018That I can\u2019t say.",
    "Wanting mayn\u2019t be any use there.",
    "But if it does happen \u2013 I\nexpect it will swallow up all the rest.",
    "They\u2019ll all go \u2013 Abbots Puissants \u2013 money\n\u2013 the girl.",
    "My dear I don\u2019t feel life\u2019s going to be easy for you.",
    "Ugh a goose is\nwalking over my grave.",
    "Now tell me something about this opera Sebastian\nLevinne says you are writing.\u2019\nWhen he had finished telling her it was nine o\u2019clock.",
    "They both exclaimed\nand went out to a little restaurant together.",
    "As he said goodbye afterwards his\nfirst diffidence returned.",
    "\u2018I think you are one of the \u2013 the nicest people I ever met.",
    "You will let me\ncome again and talk won\u2019t you If I haven\u2019t bored you too frightfully.\u2019\n\u2018Any time you like.",
    "Good night.\u2019\n\n4\nMyra wrote to Joe\n\u2018Dearest Josephine \u2013 I am so worried about Vernon and this woman he is always going up to town\nto see \u2013 some opera singer or other.",
    "Years older than he is.",
    "It\u2019s so dreadful the way women like that\nget hold of boys.",
    "I am terribly worried and don\u2019t know what to do about it.",
    "I have spoken to your\nUncle Sydney but he was not very helpful about it and just said that boys will be boys.",
    "But I don\u2019t\nwant my boy to be like that.",
    "I was wondering dear Joe if it would be any good my seeing this\nwoman and begging her to leave my boy alone.",
    "Even a bad woman would listen to a mother I\nthink.",
    "Vernon is too young to have his life ruined.",
    "I really don\u2019t know what to do.",
    "I seem to have no\ninfluence over Vernon nowadays.",
    "\u2018With much love Your affectionate\n\u2018Aunt Myra.\u2019\n\nJoe showed this letter to Sebastian.",
    "\u2018I suppose she means Jane\u2019 said Sebastian.",
    "\u2018I\u2019d rather like to see an\ninterview between them.",
    "Frankly I think Jane would be amused.\u2019\n\u2018It\u2019s too silly\u2019 said Joe hotly.",
    "\u2018I wish to goodness Vernon would fall in love\nwith Jane.",
    "It would be a hundred times better for him than being in love with that\nsilly stick of a Nell.\u2019\n\u2018You don\u2019t like Nell do you Joe\u2019\n\u2018You don\u2019t like her either.\u2019\n\u2018Oh yes I do in a way.",
    "She doesn\u2019t interest me very much but I can quite\n\n\fsee the attraction.",
    "In her own way she\u2019s quite lovely.\u2019\n\u2018Yes in a chocolate box way.\u2019\n\u2018She doesn\u2019t attract me because to my mind there\u2019s nothing there to attract\nas yet.",
    "The real Nell hasn\u2019t happened.",
    "Perhaps she never will.",
    "I suppose to some\npeople that is very attractive because it opens out all sorts of possibilities.\u2019\n\u2018Well I think Jane is worth ten of Nell The sooner Vernon gets over his\nsilly calf love for Nell and falls in love with Jane instead the better it will be.\u2019\nSebastian lit a cigarette and said slowly\n\u2018I\u2019m not sure that I agree with you.\u2019\n\u2018Why\u2019\n\u2018Well it\u2019s not very easy to explain.",
    "But you see Jane is a real person \u2013 very\nmuch so.",
    "To be in love with Jane might be a wholetime job.",
    "We\u2019re agreed\naren\u2019t we that Vernon is very possibly a genius Well I don\u2019t think a genius\nwants to be married to a real person.",
    "He wants to be married to someone rather\nnegligible \u2013 someone whose personality won\u2019t interfere.",
    "Now it may sound\ncynical but that\u2019s what will probably happen if Vernon marries Nell.",
    "At the\nmoment she represents \u2013 I don\u2019t quite know what to call it \u2013 what\u2019s that line\n\u201cThe apple tree the singing and the gold \u2026\u201d Something like that.",
    "Once he\u2019s\nmarried to her that will go.",
    "She\u2019ll just be a nice pretty sweettempered girl\nwhom naturally he loves very much.",
    "But she won\u2019t interfere \u2013 she\u2019ll never get\nbetween him and his work \u2013 she hasn\u2019t got sufficient personality.",
    "Now Jane\nmight \u2013 she wouldn\u2019t mean to but she might.",
    "It isn\u2019t Jane\u2019s beauty that attracts\nyou \u2013 it\u2019s herself.",
    "She might be absolutely fatal to Vernon \u2026\u2019\n\u2018Well\u2019 said Joe \u2018I don\u2019t agree with you.",
    "I think Nell\u2019s a silly little ass and I\nshould hate to see Vernon married to her \u2026 I hope it will all come to\nnothing \u2026\u2019\n\u2018Which is much the likeliest thing to happen\u2019 said Sebastian.",
    "Chapter Two\n1\nNell was back in London.",
    "Vernon came up to see her the day after her return.",
    "She noticed the change in him at once.",
    "He looked haggard excited.",
    "He said\nabruptly \u2018Nell I\u2019m going to chuck Birmingham.\u2019\n\u2018What\u2019\n\u2018Listen while I tell you \u2026\u2019\nHe talked eagerly excitedly.",
    "His music \u2013 he\u2019d got to give himself up to it.",
    "He told her of the opera.",
    "\u2018Listen Nell.",
    "This is you \u2013 in your tower \u2013 with your golden hair hanging\ndown and shining \u2026 shining in the sun.\u2019\nHe went to the piano began to play explaining as he did so \u2026 \u2018Violins \u2013\nyou see \u2013 and this is all for harps \u2026 and these are the round jewels \u2026\u2019\nHe played what seemed to Nell to be a series of rather ugly discords.",
    "She\nprivately thought it all hideous.",
    "Perhaps it would sound different played by an\norchestra.",
    "But she loved him \u2013 and because she loved him everything he did must be\nright.",
    "She smiled and said \u2018It\u2019s lovely Vernon.\u2019\n\u2018Do you really like it Nell Oh sweetheart \u2013 you are so wonderful.",
    "You\nalways understand.",
    "You\u2019re so sweet about everything.\u2019\nHe came across to her knelt down and buried his face on her lap.",
    "\u2018I love you so \u2026 I love you so \u2026\u2019\nShe stroked his dark head.",
    "\u2018Tell me the story of it.\u2019\n\u2018Shall I Well you see there\u2019s a princess in a tower with golden hair and\nkings and knights come from all over the world to try and get her to marry them.",
    "But she\u2019s too haughty to look at any of them \u2013 the real good old fairy story\ntouch.",
    "And at last one comes \u2013 a kind of gipsy fellow \u2013 very ragged with a little\ngreen hat on his head and a kind of pipe he plays on.",
    "And he sings and says that\nhe has the biggest kingdom of anyone because his kingdom is the whole world \u2013\nand that there are no jewels like his jewels which are dewdrops.",
    "And they say\n\n\fhe\u2019s mad and throw him out.",
    "But that night when the princess is lying in bed she\nhears him playing his song in the castle garden and she listens.",
    "\u2018Then there\u2019s an old Jew pedlar man in the town and he offers the fellow\ngold and riches with which to win the princess but the gipsy laughs and says\nwhat could he give in exchange And the old man says his green hat and the pipe\nhe plays on but the gipsy says he will never part with those.",
    "\u2018He plays in the palace garden every night \u2013 Come out my love come out\nand every night the princess lies awake and listens.",
    "There\u2019s an old bard in the\npalace and he tells a tale of how a hundred years ago a prince of the Royal\nhouse was bewitched by a gipsy maid and wandered forth and was never seen\nagain.",
    "And the princess listens to it and at last one night she gets up and comes\nto the window.",
    "And he tells her to leave all her robes and jewels behind and to\ncome out in a simple white gown.",
    "But she thinks in her heart that it\u2019s as well to\nbe on the safe side so she puts a pearl in the hem of her skirt and she comes out\nand they go off in the moonlight while he sings \u2026 But the pearl in her dress\nweighs her down and she can\u2019t keep up.",
    "And he goes on not realizing that she\u2019s\nleft behind \u2026\n\u2018I\u2019ve told this very badly \u2013 like a story but that\u2019s the end of the first act \u2013 his\ngoing off in the moonlight and her left behind weeping.",
    "There are three scenes.",
    "The Castle hall \u2013 the marketplace and the palace garden outside her window.\u2019\n\u2018Won\u2019t that be very expensive \u2013 in the way of scenery I mean\u2019 suggested\nNell.",
    "\u2018I don\u2019t know \u2013 I hadn\u2019t thought \u2013 oh it can be managed I expect.\u2019 Vernon\nwas irritated by these prosaic details.",
    "\u2018Now the second act is near the marketplace.",
    "There is a girl there mending\ndolls \u2013 with black hair hanging down round her face.",
    "The gipsy comes along\nand asks her what she\u2019s doing and she says she\u2019s mending the children\u2019s toys \u2013\nshe\u2019s got the most wonderful needle and thread in the world.",
    "He tells her all\nabout the princess and how he\u2019s lost her again and he says he\u2019s going to the old\nJew pedlar to sell his hat and his pipe and she warns him not to \u2013 but he says he\nmust.",
    "\u2018I wish I could tell things better \u2013 I\u2019m just giving you the story now \u2013 not the\nway I\u2019ve divided it up because I\u2019m not exactly sure myself yet about that.",

    "\u2018Where was I Oh yes he turns up at the palace \u2013 as a great king this time \u2013\nall clanking swords and horse trappings and blazing jewels and the princess is\noverjoyed and they\u2019re going to be married and everything\u2019s all right.",
    "But he\nbegins to get pale and weary worse every day and when anyone asks him what\nis the matter he says \u201cNothing.\u201d\u2019\n\u2018Like you when you were a little boy at Abbots Puissants\u2019 said Nell\nsmiling.",

    "And when he wakes in the morning there are his\ngreen hat and his pipe mended so beautifully that no one could tell they had\nbeen mended.",
    "\u2018And then he laughs for joy and she goes to a cupboard and pulls out a\nsimilar little green hat and a pipe and they go out together through the forest\nand just as the sun rises on the edge of the forest he looks at her and remembers.",
    "He says \u201cWhy a hundred years ago I left my palace and my throne for love of\nyou.\u201d And she says \u201cYes.",
    "But because you were afraid you hid a piece of gold\nin the lining of your doublet and the gleam of it enchanted your eyes and we lost\neach other.",

    "The wives of musicians were always unhappy she had read that somewhere.",

    "He\nnever had the faintest conception of her difficulties.",
    "He would perhaps have\ncalled them silly or trivial \u2013 they were in one sense but in another they weren\u2019t\n\u2013 since the sum total of them went to make up her life.",

    "Not superficially perhaps but fundamentally.",
    "We both like truth.",

    "Joe for instance prides herself on being\nunconventional but that makes just as much for narrowness and prejudice.\u2019\n\u2018Yes if you\u2019re \u201cagin\u201d everything irrespective of what it is.",
    "Joe is like that.",
    "She must be a rebel.",
    "She never really examines a thing on its merits.",

    "I\u2019ve been with him now.",
    "He\u2019s absolutely broken up over it.",
    "I\u2019d no idea how much he cared for Joe.\u2019\n\u2018I know he did.\u2019\n\u2018You see there were the three of us \u2013 always.",
    "Joe and I and Sebastian.",
    "We\nbelonged together.\u2019\nA faint pang of jealousy shot through Nell.",

    "It\u2019s \u2013 oh I don\u2019t know \u2013 I feel as though I\u2019d been to blame\nin some way.",
    "I\u2019ve let myself get out of touch with Joe.",
    "Dear old Joe she was so\nstaunch always \u2013 better than any sister could be.",
    "It hurts me to think of the things\nshe used to say when she was a kid \u2013 how she\u2019d never have anything to do with\nmen.",
    "And now she\u2019s come a mucker like this.\u2019\nNell said in a shocked voice\n\u2018A married man.",
    "That\u2019s what makes it so awful.",
    "Had he any children\u2019\n\u2018How should I know anything about his beastly children\u2019\n\u2018Vernon \u2013 don\u2019t be so cross.\u2019\n\u2018Sorry Nell.",
    "I\u2019m upset that\u2019s all.\u2019\n\u2018How could she do such a thing\u2019 said Nell.",
    "She had always rather resented\nJoe\u2019s unspoken contempt of which she had been subconsciously aware.",
    "She\nwould not have been human had she not felt a faint sense of superiority.",
    "\u2018To run\naway with anyone married It\u2019s dreadful\u2019\n\u2018Well she had courage anyway\u2019 said Vernon.",
    "He felt a sudden passionate desire to defend Joe \u2013 Joe who belonged to\nAbbots Puissants and the old days.",
    "\u2018Courage\u2019 said Nell.",
    "\u2018Yes courage\u2019 said Vernon.",
    "\u2018At anyrate she wasn\u2019t prudent.",

    "She\u2019s chucked away everything in the world for love.",
    "That\u2019s\nmore than some people will do.\u2019\n\u2018Vernon\u2019\nShe got up breathing hard.",
    "\u2018Well it\u2019s true.\u2019 All his smouldering resentment came bursting out.",
    "\u2018You\nwon\u2019t even face a little discomfort for me Nell.",
    "You\u2019re always saying \u201cWait\u201d\nand \u201cLet\u2019s be careful.\u201d You aren\u2019t capable of chucking everything to the winds\nfor love of anyone.\u2019\n\u2018Oh Vernon how cruel you are \u2026 how cruel \u2026\u2019\nHe saw the tears come into her eyes and was immediately all compunction.",
    "\u2018Oh Nell I didn\u2019t mean it \u2013 I didn\u2019t mean it sweetheart.\u2019\nHis arms went round her held her to him.",
    "Her sobs lessened.",

    "\u2018Damn I must go.",
    "Good night Nell darling.",
    "You do love me don\u2019t you\u2019\n\u2018Yes of course \u2013 of course I do.\u2019\nHe kissed her once more hurried off.",
    "She sat down again by the disordered\ndinner table.",
    "Sat there \u2013 lost in thought \u2026\n\n4\nHe got to Covent Garden late.",
    "Peer Gynt had begun.",
    "The scene was Ingrid\u2019s\nwedding and Vernon arrived just at the moment of the first brief meeting of Peer\nand Solveig.",
    "He wondered if Jane were nervous.",
    "She managed to look\nmarvellously young with her fair plaits and her innocent calm bearing.",
    "She\nlooked nineteen.",
    "The act ended with the carrying off of Ingrid by Peer.",
    "Vernon found himself interested less in the music than in Jane.",
    "Tonight was\nJane\u2019s ordeal.",
    "She had to make good or go under.",
    "Vernon knew how anxious she\nwas above everything else to justify Radmaager\u2019s trust in her.",
    "Presently he knew that all was well.",
    "Jane was the perfect Solveig.",
    "Her voice\nclear and true \u2013 the crystal thread as Radmaager had called it \u2013 sang\nunfalteringly and her acting was wonderful.",
    "The calm steadfast personality of\nSolveig dominated the opera.",
    "Vernon found himself for the first time interested in the story of the weak\nstormtorn Peer the coward who ran from reality at every opportunity.",
    "The\nmusic of Peer\u2019s conflict with the great Boyg stirred him reminding him of his\nchildish terror of The Beast.",
    "It was the same formless bogey fear of childhood.",
    "Unseen Solveig\u2019s clear voice delivered him from it.",
    "The scene in the forest\nwhere Solveig comes to Peer was infinitely beautiful ending with Peer bidding\nSolveig remain while he went out to take up his burden.",
    "Her reply \u2018If it is so\nheavy it is best two should share it.\u2019 And then Peer\u2019s departure his final evasion\n\u2018Bring sorrow on her No.",
    "Go roundabout Peer go roundabout.\u2019\nThe Whitsuntide music was the most beautiful \u2013 but in atmosphere very\nRadmaagian Vernon thought.",
    "It led up to and prepared for the effect of the final\nscene.",
    "The weary Peer asleep with his head on Solveig\u2019s lap and Solveig her\nhair silvered a Madonna blue cloak round her in the middle of the stage her\nhead silhouetted against the rising sun singing valiantly against the Buttons\nMoulder.",
    "It was a wonderful duet \u2013 Chavaranov the famous Russian bass his voice\ndeepening and deepening and Jane with her silver thread singing steadily\n\n\fupward and ever upward higher and higher \u2013 till the last note was left to her \u2013\nhigh and incredibly pure \u2026 And the sun rose \u2026\nVernon feeling boyishly important went behind afterwards.",
    "The opera had\nbeen a terrific success.",
    "The applause had been long and enthusiastic.",
    "He found\nRadmaager holding Jane by the hand and kissing her with artistic fervour and\nthoroughness.",
    "\u2018You are an angel \u2013 you are magnificent \u2013 yes magnificent You are an artist\n\u2013 Ah\u2019 he burst into a torrent of words in his native language then reverted to\nEnglish.",
    "\u2018I will reward you \u2013 yes little one I will reward you.",
    "I know very well\nhow to do it.",
    "I will persuade the long Sebastian.",
    "Together we will \u2013\u2019\n\u2018Hush\u2019 said Jane.",
    "Vernon came forward awkwardly said shyly \u2018It was splendid\u2019\nHe squeezed Jane\u2019s hand and she gave him a brief affectionate smile.",
    "\u2018Where\u2019s Sebastian Wasn\u2019t he here just now\u2019\nSebastian was no longer to be seen.",
    "Vernon volunteered to go in search of\nhim and bring him along to supper.",
    "He said vaguely that he thought he knew\nwhere he was.",
    "Jane knew nothing of the news about Joe and he didn\u2019t see how\nhe could tell her at the moment.",
    "He got a taxi and drove to Sebastian\u2019s house but did not find him.",
    "Vernon\nwondered if perhaps Sebastian might be at his own rooms where he had left him\nearlier in the evening.",
    "He drove there straight away.",
    "He was feeling suddenly\nelated and triumphant.",
    "Even Joe did not seem to matter for the moment.",
    "He felt\nsuddenly convinced that his own work was good \u2013 or rather that it would be\nsome day.",
    "And somehow or other he also felt that things were coming right with\nNell.",
    "She had clung to him differently tonight \u2013 more closely \u2013 more as though\nshe could not bear to let him go \u2026 Yes he was sure of it.",
    "Everything was\ncoming right.",
    "He ran up the stairs to his room.",
    "It was in darkness.",
    "Sebastian was not here\nthen.",
    "He switched on the light \u2013 looked round.",
    "A note lay on the table sent by\nhand.",
    "He picked it up.",
    "It was addressed to him in Nell\u2019s handwriting.",
    "He tore it\nopen \u2026\nHe stood there a long time.",
    "Then carefully and methodically he drew up a\nchair to the table setting it very exactly straight as though that were important\nand sat down holding the note in his hand.",
    "He read it again for the tenth or\neleventh time \u2018Dearest Vernon \u2013 Forgive me \u2013 please forgive me.",
    "I am going to\nmarry George Chetwynd.",
    "I don\u2019t love him like I love you but I shall be safe\nwith him.",
    "Again \u2013 do forgive me \u2013 please.",
    "\u2018Your always loving\n\u2018Nell.\u2019\n\nHe said aloud \u2018Safe with him.",
    "What does she mean by that She\u2019d have been\nsafe with me.",
    "Safe with him That hurts \u2026\u2019\nHe sat there.",
    "Minutes passed \u2026 Hours passed \u2026 He sat there motionless\nalmost unable to think \u2026 Once the thought rose dully in his brain \u2018Was this\nhow Sebastian felt I didn\u2019t understand \u2026\u2019\nWhen he heard a rustle in the doorway he didn\u2019t look up.",
    "His first sight of\nJane was when she came round the table dropped on her knees beside him.",
    "\u2018Vernon \u2013 my dear \u2013 what is it I knew there was something when you didn\u2019t\ncome to the supper.",
    "I came to see \u2026\u2019\nDully mechanically he held out the note to her.",
    "She took it and read it.",
    "She\nlaid it down again on the table.",
    "He said in a dull bewildered voice \u2018She needn\u2019t have said that \u2013 about not\nbeing safe with me.",
    "She would have been safe with me \u2026\u2019\n\u2018Oh Vernon \u2013 my dear \u2026\u2019\nHer arms went round him.",
    "He clutched at her suddenly \u2013 a frightened clutch\nsuch as a child might give at its mother.",
    "A sob burst from his throat.",
    "He laid his\nface down on the gleaming white skin of her neck.",
    "\u2018Oh Jane \u2026 Jane \u2026\u2019\nShe held him closer.",
    "She stroked his hair.",
    "He murmured\n\u2018Stay with me \u2026 Stay with me \u2026 Don\u2019t leave me \u2026\u2019\nShe answered\n\u2018I won\u2019t leave you.",
    "It\u2019s all right \u2026\u2019\nHer voice was tender \u2013 motherly.",
    "Something broke in him like the breaking\nof a dam.",
    "Ideas swirled and rushed through his head.",
    "His father kissing Winnie\nat Abbots Puissants \u2026 the statue in the South Kensington \u2026 Jane\u2019s body \u2026 her\nbeautiful body.",
    "He said hoarsely \u2018Stay with me \u2026\u2019\nHer arms round him her lips on his forehead she murmured back \u2018I\u2019ll stay\nwith you dear.\u2019\nLike a mother to a child.",
    "He wrenched himself suddenly free.",
    "\u2018Not like that.",
    "Not like that.",
    "Like this.\u2019\nHis lips fastened on hers \u2013 fiercely hungrily his hand clutched at the\nroundness of her breast.",
    "He\u2019d always wanted her \u2013 always \u2013 he knew it now.",
    "It\nwas her body he wanted that beautiful gracious body that Boris Androv had\n\n\fknown so well.",
    "He said again\n\u2018Stay with me \u2026\u2019\nThere was a long pause \u2013 it seemed to him as though minutes hours years\npassed before she answered She said \u2018I\u2019ll stay \u2026\u2019\n\n\fChapter Four\n1\nOn a day in July Sebastian Levinne walked along the Embankment in the\ndirection of Jane\u2019s flat.",
    "It was a day more suggestive of early spring than of\nsummer.",
    "A cold wind blew the dust in his face and made him blink.",
    "There was a change visible in Sebastian.",
    "He had grown perceptibly older.",
    "There was very little of the boy about him now \u2013 there never had been much.",
    "He\nhad always had that curious maturity of outlook which is the Semitic inheritance.",
    "As he walked along now frowning to himself and pondering he would easily\nhave been taken for a man over thirty.",
    "Jane herself opened the door of the flat to him.",
    "She spoke in a low unusually\nhusky voice.",
    "\u2018Vernon\u2019s out.",
    "He couldn\u2019t wait for you.",
    "You said three you know and it\u2019s\npast four now.\u2019\n\u2018I was kept.",
    "Just as well perhaps.",
    "I\u2019m never quite sure of the best way of\ndealing with Vernon\u2019s nerves.\u2019\n\u2018Don\u2019t tell me any fresh crises have arisen I couldn\u2019t bear it.\u2019\n\u2018Oh you\u2019ll get used to them.",
    "I\u2019ve had to.",
    "What\u2019s the matter with your voice\nJane\u2019\n\u2018A cold.",
    "A throat rather.",
    "It\u2019s all right.",
    "I\u2019m nursing it.\u2019\n\u2018My God And the Princess in the Tower tomorrow night.",
    "Suppose you can\u2019t\nsing.\u2019\n\u2018Oh I shall sing.",
    "Don\u2019t be afraid.",
    "Only don\u2019t mind my whispering.",
    "I want to\nsave it every bit I can.\u2019\n\u2018Of course.",
    "You\u2019ve seen someone I suppose\u2019\n\u2018My usual man in Harley Street.\u2019\n\u2018What did he say\u2019\n\u2018The usual things.\u2019\n\u2018He didn\u2019t forbid you to sing tomorrow\u2019\n\u2018Oh no.\u2019\n\u2018You\u2019re an awfully good liar aren\u2019t you Jane\u2019\n\n\f\u2018I thought it would save trouble.",
    "But I might have known it would be no\ngood with you.",
    "I\u2019ll be honest.",
    "He warned me that I\u2019d been persistently overstraining my voice for years.",
    "He said it was madness to sing tomorrow night.",
    "But\nI don\u2019t care.\u2019\n\u2018My dear Jane I\u2019m not going to risk your losing your voice.\u2019\n\u2018Mind your own business Sebastian.",
    "My voice is my affair.",
    "I don\u2019t interfere\nin your concerns don\u2019t interfere in mine.\u2019\nSebastian grinned.",
    "\u2018The tiger cat at home\u2019 he remarked.",
    "\u2018But you mustn\u2019t Jane all the same.",
    "Does Vernon know\u2019\n\u2018Of course not.",
    "What do you think And you\u2019re not to tell him Sebastian.\u2019\n\u2018I don\u2019t interfere really\u2019 said Sebastian.",
    "\u2018I never have.",
    "But Jane dear it will\nbe ten thousand pities.",
    "The opera\u2019s not worth it.",
    "And Vernon\u2019s not worth it\neither.",
    "Be angry with me if you like for saying so.\u2019\n\u2018Why should I be angry with you It\u2019s the truth and I know it.",
    "All the same\nI\u2019m going through with it.",
    "Call me any kind of a conceited egoist you like but\nthe Princess in the Tower won\u2019t be a success without me.",
    "I\u2019ve been a success as\nIsolde and a furore in Solveig.",
    "It\u2019s my moment.",
    "And it\u2019s going to be Vernon\u2019s\nmoment too.",
    "I can at least do that for him.\u2019\nHe heard the undercurrent of feeling \u2013 the unconscious betrayal of that \u2018at\nleast\u2019 but not by a muscle of his face did he show that he had realized its\nsignificance.",
    "He only said again very gently \u2018He\u2019s not worth it Jane.",
    "Paddle\nyour own canoe.",
    "It\u2019s the only way.",
    "You\u2019ve arrived.",
    "Vernon hasn\u2019t and never\nmay.\u2019\n\u2018I know.",
    "I know.",

    "You\u2019re worth it \u2013 and yet it\u2019s not for you I\u2019m doing it\u2019\nSebastian was surprised and touched.",
    "A sudden mist came over his eyes.",
    "He\nstretched out his hand and took Jane\u2019s.",
    "They sat for a minute or two in silence.",
    "\u2018That was nice of you Jane\u2019 he said at last.",
    "\u2018Well it\u2019s true.",
    "You\u2019re worth a dozen of Vernon.",
    "You\u2019ve got brains\ninitiative strength of character \u2026\u2019\nHer husky voice died away.",
    "After another minute or two he said very gently\n\u2018How are things Much as usual\u2019\n\u2018Yes I think so.",
    "You know Mrs Deyre came to see me\u2019\n\u2018No I didn\u2019t.",
    "What did she want\u2019\n\n\f\u2018She came to beg me to give up her boy.",
    "Pointed out how I was ruining his\nlife.",
    "Only a really bad woman would do what I was doing.",
    "And so on.",
    "You can\nguess the kind of thing.\u2019\n\u2018And what did you say to her\u2019 asked Sebastian curiously.",
    "Jane shrugged her shoulders.",
    "\u2018What could I say That to Vernon one harlot was as good as another\u2019\n\u2018Oh my dear\u2019 said Sebastian gently.",
    "\u2018Is it as bad as that\u2019\nJane got up lighted a cigarette and walked restlessly about the room.",
    "Sebastian noticed how haggard her face had become.",
    "\u2018Is he \u2013 more or less all right\u2019 he ventured.",
    "\u2018He drinks too much\u2019 said Jane curtly.",
    "\u2018Can\u2019t you prevent it\u2019\n\u2018No I can\u2019t.\u2019\n\u2018It\u2019s queer.",
    "I should have thought you would always have great influence\nover Vernon.\u2019\n\u2018Well I haven\u2019t.",
    "Not now.\u2019 She was silent for a moment and then said\n\u2018Nell\u2019s being married in the autumn isn\u2019t she\u2019\n\u2018Yes.",
    "Do you think things will be \u2013 better then\u2019\n\u2018I haven\u2019t the least idea.\u2019\n\u2018I wish to God he\u2019d pull up\u2019 said Sebastian.",
    "\u2018If you can\u2019t keep him straight\nJane nobody can.",

    "\u2018Tell me \u2013 tell me everything you know.",
    "About his people \u2013 his father his\nmother.\u2019\nSebastian gave a succinct account of the Deyres.",
    "Jane listened.",
    "\u2018His mother you\u2019ve seen\u2019 he concluded.",
    "\u2018Queer isn\u2019t it that Vernon doesn\u2019t\nseem to have inherited one single thing from her He\u2019s a Deyre through and\nthrough.",
    "They are all artistic \u2013 musical \u2013 weakwilled selfindulgent and\nattractive to women.",
    "Heredity\u2019s an odd thing.\u2019\n\u2018I don\u2019t quite agree with you\u2019 said Jane.",

    "She\u2019s an extraordinarily fine animal \u2013 have you ever thought of her\nthat way Well Vernon\u2019s inherited some of that.",
    "Without it he\u2019d never have\nbeen a composer.",
    "If he was a Deyre pure and simple he\u2019d only have dallied with\nmusic.",
    "It\u2019s the Bent force that gives him the power to create.",
    "You say his\ngrandfather built up their business singlehanded.",
    "Well there\u2019s the same thing in\n\n\fVernon.\u2019\n\u2018I wonder if you\u2019re right.\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019m sure I am.\u2019\nSebastian considered silently for some minutes.",
    "\u2018Is it only drink\u2019 he said at last.",
    "\u2018Or is it \u2013 well I mean are there \u2013 other\npeople\u2019\n\u2018Oh there are others.\u2019\n\u2018And you don\u2019t mind\u2019\n\u2018Mind Mind Of course I mind.",
    "What do you think I\u2019m made of Sebastian\nI\u2019m nearly killed with minding \u2026 But what can I do Make scenes Rant and\nrave and drive Vernon away from me altogether\u2019\nHer beautiful husky voice rose from its whisper.",
    "Sebastian made a quick\ngesture and she stopped.",
    "\u2018You\u2019re right.",
    "I must be careful.\u2019\n\u2018I can\u2019t understand it\u2019 grumbled Sebastian.",
    "\u2018Even his music doesn\u2019t seem to\nmean anything to Vernon now.",
    "He\u2019s taken every suggestion from Radmaager\nand been like a lamb.",

    "Her voice expressed nothing.",
    "\u2018She\u2019s in London.\u2019\nThere was a pause.",
    "\u2018I see\u2019 said Mrs Levinne.",
    "Still her voice expressed nothing.",
    "But Sebastian was aware of a whole tumult\nof feeling.",
    "It was the same to him as though his mother had burst out \u2018My son\nmy son And you were just beginning to forget her Why does she come back\nlike this Why can\u2019t she leave you alone This girl who has nothing to do with\nus or our race This girl who was never the right wife for you and never will be.\u2019\nSebastian rose.",
    "\u2018I think I must go round and see her.\u2019\nHis mother answered in the same voice \u2018I suppose so.\u2019\nThey said no more.",
    "They understood each other.",
    "Each respected the other\u2019s\npoint of view.",
    "As he swung along the street it suddenly occurred to Sebastian that Joe had\n\n\fgiven him no clue as to what name she was staying under at the hotel.",
    "Did she\ncall herself Miss Waite or Madame La Marre Unimportant of course but one\nof those silly conventional absurdities that made one feel awkward.",
    "He must ask\nfor her under one or the other.",
    "How like Joe it was to have completely\noverlooked the point\nBut as it happened there was no awkwardness for the first person he saw as\nhe passed through the swing doors was Joe herself.",
    "She greeted him with a glad\ncry of surprise.",
    "\u2018Sebastian I\u2019d no idea you could possibly have got my letter so soon\u2019\nShe led the way to a retired corner of the lounge and he followed her.",
    "His first feeling was that she had changed \u2013 she had gone so far away that\nshe was almost a stranger.",
    "It was partly he thought her clothes.",
    "They were ultra\nFrench clothes.",
    "Very quiet and dark and discreet but utterly unEnglish.",
    "Her\nface too was very much made up.",
    "Its creamy pallor was enhanced by art her\nlips were impossibly red and she had done something to the corners of her eyes.",
    "He thought \u2018She\u2019s a stranger \u2013 and yet she\u2019s Joe She\u2019s the same Joe but\nshe\u2019s gone a long way away \u2013 so far away that one can only just get in touch\nwith her.\u2019\nBut they talked together easily enough each as it were putting out little\nfeelers as though sounding the distance that separated them.",
    "And suddenly the\ndistance itself lessened and the elegant Parisian stranger melted into Joe.",
    "They talked of Vernon.",
    "Where was he He never wrote or told one anything.",
    "\u2018He\u2019s on Salisbury Plain \u2013 near Wiltsbury.",
    "He may be going out to France\nany minute.\u2019\n\u2018And Nell married him after all Sebastian I feel I was rather a beast about\nNell.",
    "I didn\u2019t think she had it in her.",
    "I don\u2019t think she would have had it in her if\nit hadn\u2019t been for the war.",
    "Sebastian isn\u2019t the war wonderful What it\u2019s doing\nfor people I mean.\u2019\nSebastian said drily that he supposed it was very much like any other war.",
    "Joe flew out at him vehemently.",
    "\u2018It isn\u2019t.",
    "It isn\u2019t.",
    "That\u2019s just where you\u2019re wrong.",
    "There\u2019s going to be a new\nworld after it.",
    "People are beginning to see things \u2013 things they never saw before.",
    "All the cruelty and the wickedness and the waste of war.",
    "And they\u2019ll stand\ntogether so that such a thing shall never happen again.\u2019\nHer face was flushed and exalted.",
    "Sebastian perceived that the war had as he\nphrased it \u2018got\u2019 Joe.",
    "The war did get people.",
    "He had discussed it and deplored it\nwith Jane.",
    "It made him sick to read the things that were printed and said about\n\n\fthe war.",
    "\u2018A world fit for heroes\u2019 \u2018The war to end war\u2019 \u2018The fight for\ndemocracy\u2019.",
    "And really all the time it was the same old bloody business it\nalways had been.",
    "Why couldn\u2019t people speak the truth about it\nJane had disagreed with him.",
    "She maintained that the claptrap for she\nagreed it was claptrap which was written about war was inevitable a kind of\naccompanying phenomenon inseparable from it.",
    "It was Nature\u2019s way of\nproviding a way of escape \u2013 you had to have that wall of illusion and lies to help\nyou to endure the solid facts.",
    "It was to her pitiable and almost beautiful \u2013 these\nthings that we wanted to believe and told ourselves so speciously.",
    "Sebastian had said \u2018I dare say but it\u2019s going to play Hell with the nation\nafterwards.\u2019\nHe was saddened and a little depressed by Joe\u2019s fiery enthusiasm.",
    "And yet\nafter all it was typical of Joe.",
    "Her enthusiasm always was red hot.",
    "It was a toss\nup which camp he found her in that was all.",
    "She might just as easily have been a\nwhite hot pacifist embracing martyrdom with fervour.",
    "She said now accusingly to Sebastian\n\u2018You don\u2019t agree You think everything\u2019s going to be just the same.\u2019\n\u2018There have always been wars and they have never made any great\ndifference.\u2019\n\u2018Yes but this is a different kind of war altogether.\u2019\nHe smiled.",
    "He could not help it.",
    "\u2018My dear Joe the things that happen to us personally are always different.\u2019\n\u2018Oh I\u2019ve no patience with you.",
    "It\u2019s people like you \u2013\u2019\nShe stopped.",
    "\u2018Yes\u2019 said Sebastian encouragingly.",
    "\u2018People like me \u2013\u2019\n\u2018You usen\u2019t to be like that.",
    "You used to have ideas.",
    "Now \u2013\u2019\n\u2018Now\u2019 said Sebastian gravely \u2018I am sunk in money.",
    "I\u2019m a capitalist.",
    "Everyone knows what a hoggish creature the capitalist is.\u2019\n\u2018Don\u2019t be absurd.",
    "But I do think that money is rather \u2013 well stifling.\u2019\n\u2018Yes\u2019 said Sebastian \u2018that\u2019s true enough.",
    "But that\u2019s a question of effect on\nan individual.",
    "I will quite agree with you that poverty is a blessed state.",
    "Talking\nin terms of art it\u2019s probably as valuable as manure in a garden.",
    "But it\u2019s nonsense\nto say that because I\u2019ve got money I\u2019m unfit to make prognostications as to the\nfuture and especially as to the state obtaining after the war.",
    "Just because I\u2019ve got\nmoney I\u2019m all the more likely to be a good judge.",
    "Money has got a lot to do with\nwar.\u2019\n\u2018Yes but because you think of everything in terms of money you say that\n\n\fthere always will be wars.\u2019\n\u2018I didn\u2019t say anything of the kind.",
    "I think war will eventually be abolished \u2013\nI\u2019d give it roughly another two hundred years.\u2019\n\u2018Ah you do admit that by then we may have purer ideals.\u2019\n\u2018I don\u2019t think it\u2019s got anything to do with ideals.",
    "It\u2019s probably a question of\ntransport.",
    "Once you get flying going on a commercial scale and you fuse\ncountries together.",
    "Air charabancs to the Sahara Wednesdays and Saturdays.",
    "That kind of thing.",
    "Countries getting mixed up and matey.",
    "Trade revolutionized.",
    "For all practical purposes you make the world smaller.",
    "You reduce it in time to\nthe level of a nation with counties in it.",
    "I don\u2019t think what\u2019s always alluded to as\nthe Brotherhood of Man will ever develop from fine ideas \u2013 it will be a simple\nmatter of common sense.\u2019\n\u2018Oh Sebastian\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019m annoying you.",
    "I\u2019m sorry Joe dear.\u2019\n\u2018You don\u2019t believe in anything.\u2019\n\u2018Well it\u2019s you who are the atheist you know.",
    "Though as a matter of fact\nthat word has gone out of fashion.",
    "We say nowadays that we believe in\nSomething Personally I\u2019m quite satisfied with Jehovah.",
    "But I know what you\nmeant when you said that and you\u2019re wrong.",
    "I believe in beauty in creation in\nthings like Vernon\u2019s music.",
    "I can\u2019t see any real defence for them economically\nand yet I\u2019m perfectly sure that they matter more than anything else in the world.",
    "I\u2019m even prepared sometimes to drop money over them.",
    "That\u2019s a lot for a\nJew\u2019\nJoe laughed in spite of herself.",
    "Then she asked\n\u2018What was the Princess in the Tower really like Honestly Sebastian\u2019\n\u2018Oh rather like a giant toddling \u2013 an unconvincing performance and yet a\nperformance on a different scale from anything else.\u2019\n\u2018You think that some day \u2013\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019m sure of it.",
    "There\u2019s nothing I\u2019m so sure of as that.",
    "If only he isn\u2019t killed\nin this bloody war.\u2019\nJoe shivered.",
    "\u2018It\u2019s so awful\u2019 she murmured.",
    "\u2018I\u2019ve been working in the hospitals in Paris.",
    "Some of the things one sees\u2019\n\u2018I know.",
    "If he\u2019s only maimed it doesn\u2019t matter \u2013 not like a violinist who is\nfinished if he loses his right hand.",
    "No they can mess up his body any way they\nlike \u2013 so long as his brain is left untouched.",
    "That sounds brutal but you know\nwhat I mean \u2013\u2019\n\n\f\u2018I know.",
    "But sometimes \u2013 even then \u2013\u2019 She broke off and then went on\nspeaking in a new tone of voice.",
    "\u2018Sebastian I\u2019m married.\u2019\nIf something in him winced he didn\u2019t show it.",
    "\u2018Are you my dear Did La Marre get a divorce\u2019\n\u2018No.",
    "I left him.",
    "He was a beast \u2013 a beast Sebastian.\u2019\n\u2018I can imagine he might be.\u2019\n\u2018Not that I regret anything.",
    "One has to live one\u2019s life \u2013 to gain experience.",
    "Anything is better than shrinking from life.",
    "That\u2019s just what people like Aunt\nMyra can\u2019t understand.",
    "I\u2019m not going near them at Birmingham.",
    "I\u2019m not\nashamed or repentant of anything I\u2019ve done.\u2019\nShe gazed at him defiantly and his mind went back to Joe in the woods at\nAbbots Puissants.",
    "He thought \u2018She\u2019s just the same.",
    "Wrongheaded rebellious\nadorable.",
    "One might have known then that she\u2019d do these sort of things.\u2019\nHe said gently \u2018I\u2019m only sorry that you\u2019ve been unhappy.",
    "Because you have\nbeen unhappy haven\u2019t you\u2019\n\u2018Horribly.",
    "But I\u2019ve found my real life now.",
    "There was a boy in hospital \u2013\nterribly badly wounded.",
    "They gave him morphia.",
    "He\u2019s been discharged now \u2013\ncured though of course he isn\u2019t fit for service.",
    "But the morphia \u2013 it\u2019s got hold of\nhim.",
    "That\u2019s why \u2013 we were married.",
    "A fortnight ago.",
    "We\u2019re going to fight it\ntogether.\u2019\nSebastian did not trust himself to speak.",
    "Joe all over.",
    "But why in the name of\nfortune couldn\u2019t she have been content with physical disabilities Morphia.",
    "A\nghastly business.",
    "And suddenly a pang shot through him.",
    "It was as though he resigned his last\nhope of her.",
    "Their ways led in opposite directions \u2013 Joe amongst her lost causes\nand her lame dogs and he on an upward route.",
    "He might of course be killed in\nthe war but somehow he didn\u2019t think he would be.",
    "He was almost certain that he\nwouldn\u2019t even be picturesquely wounded.",
    "He felt a kind of certitude that he\nwould come through safely probably with moderate distinction that he would\ncome back to his enterprises reorganizing and revitalizing them that he would\nbe successful \u2013 notably successful \u2013 in a world that did not tolerate failures.",
    "And\nthe higher he climbed the further he would be separated from Joe.",
    "He thought bitterly \u2018There\u2019s always some woman to pull you out of a pit\nbut nobody will come and keep you company on a mountain peak and yet you\nmay be damned lonely there.\u2019\nHe didn\u2019t quite know what to say to Joe.",
    "No good depressing her poor child.",
    "He said rather weakly\n\n\f\u2018What\u2019s your name now\u2019\n\u2018Valni\u00e8re.",
    "You must meet Fran\u00e7ois some time.",
    "I\u2019ve just come over to settle\nup some legal bothers.",
    "Father died about a month ago you know.\u2019\nSebastian nodded.",
    "He remembered hearing of Colonel Waite\u2019s death.",
    "Joe went on.",
    "\u2018I want to see Jane.",
    "And I want to see Vernon and Nell.\u2019\nIt was settled that he should motor her down to Wiltsbury on the following\nday.",
    "2\nNell and Vernon had rooms in a small prim house about a mile out of Wiltsbury.",
    "Vernon looking well and brown fell upon Joe and hugged her with enthusiasm.",
    "They all went into a room full of antimacassars and lunched off boiled\nmutton and caper sauce.",
    "\u2018Vernon you look splendid \u2013 and almost goodlooking doesn\u2019t he Nell\u2019\n\u2018That\u2019s the uniform\u2019 said Nell demurely.",
    "She had changed Sebastian thought looking at her.",
    "He had not seen her\nsince her marriage four months previously.",
    "To him she had always fallen into a\nclass \u2013 a certain type of charming young girl.",
    "Now he saw her as an individual \u2013\nthe real Nell bursting out of her chrysalis.",
    "There was a subdued radiance about her.",
    "She was quieter than she used to be\n\u2013 and yet she was more alive.",
    "They were happy together \u2013 no one who looked at\nthem could doubt it.",
    "They seldom looked at each other but when they did you\nfelt it \u2026 something passed between them \u2013 delicate evanescent but\nunmistakable.",
    "It was a happy meal.",
    "They talked of old days \u2013 of Abbots Puissants.",
    "\u2018And here we are all four of us together again\u2019 said Joe.",
    "A warm feeling fastened round Nell\u2019s heart.",
    "Joe had included her.",
    "All four of\nus she had said.",
    "Nell remembered how once Vernon had said \u2018We three \u2013\u2019 and\nthe words had hurt her.",
    "But that was over now.",
    "She was one of them.",
    "That was\nher reward \u2013 one of her rewards.",
    "Life seemed full of rewards at the moment.",
    "She was happy \u2013 so terribly happy and she might so easily not have been\nhappy.",
    "She might have been actually married to George when the war broke out.",
    "How could she ever have been so incredibly foolish as to think that anything\nmattered except marrying Vernon How extraordinarily happy they were and\nhow right he had been to say poverty didn\u2019t matter.",
    "It wasn\u2019t as though she were the only one.",
    "Lots of girls were doing it \u2013\nflinging up everything \u2013 marrying the man they cared for no matter how poor he\nwas.",
    "After the war something would turn up.",
    "That was the attitude.",
    "And behind\nit lay that awful secret fear that you never took out and looked at properly.",
    "The\nnearest you ever got to it was saying defiantly \u2018And no matter what happens\nwe\u2019ll have had something.\u2019\nShe thought \u2018The world\u2019s changing.",
    "Everything\u2019s different now.",
    "It always\nwill be.",
    "We\u2019ll never go back \u2026\u2019\nShe looked across the table at Joe.",
    "Joe looked different somehow \u2013 very\nqueer.",
    "What you would have called before the war \u2013 well \u2018not quite\u2019.",
    "What had\nJoe been doing with herself That nasty man La Marre \u2026 Oh well better not\nthink about it.",
    "Nothing mattered nowadays.",
    "Joe was so nice to her \u2013 so different to what she used to be in the old days\nwhen Nell had always felt uncomfortably that Joe despised her.",
    "Perhaps she had\ncause.",
    "She had been a little coward.",
    "The war was awful of course but it had simplified things.",
    "Her mother for\ninstance had come round almost at once.",
    "She was disappointed naturally about\nGeorge Chetwynd poor George he really was a dear and she\u2019d been a beast to\nhim but Mrs Vereker proceeded to make the best of things with admirable\ncommon sense.",
    "\u2018These war marriages\u2019 She used that phrase with a tiny shrug of the\nshoulders.",
    "\u2018Poor children \u2013 you can\u2019t blame them.",
    "Not wise perhaps \u2013 but what\nis wisdom at a time like this\u2019 Mrs Vereker needed all her skill and all her wit to\ndeal with her creditors and she had come off pretty well.",
    "Some of them even felt\nsympathy for her.",
    "If she and Vernon didn\u2019t really like each other they concealed the fact quite\ncreditably and as a matter of fact had only met once since the marriage.",
    "It had\nall been so easy.",
    "Perhaps if you had courage things were always easy.",
    "Perhaps that was the\ngreat secret of life.",
    "Nell pondered then waking from her reverie plunged once more into the\nconversation.",
    "Sebastian was speaking.",

    "One would never be surprised with Jane.\u2019\n\u2018How long is it since you\u2019ve seen her\u2019 asked Joe.",
    "\u2018Exactly Oh about three weeks.\u2019\n\u2018Is that all I thought you meant really ages.\u2019\n\u2018It seems like it\u2019 said Sebastian.",
    "They began to talk of Joe\u2019s hospital in Paris.",
    "Then they talked of Myra and\nUncle Sydney.",
    "Myra was very well and making an incredible quantity of swabs\nand also did duty twice a week at a canteen.",
    "Uncle Sydney was well on the way\nto making a second fortune having started the manufacture of explosives.",
    "\u2018He\u2019s got off the mark early\u2019 said Sebastian appreciatively.",

    "The days of an \u2018optimistic six months\u2019 were over but\nthree years were regarded as too gloomy a view.",
    "Sebastian talked about\nexplosives the state of Russia the food question and submarines.",
    "He was a little\ndictatorial since he was perfectly sure that he was right.",
    "At five o\u2019clock Sebastian and Joe got into the car and drove back to London.",

    "Don\u2019t you\u2019\nThey were strolling along the road and they turned off where a track led over\nthe downs.",
    "\u2018Yes\u2019 said Vernon with a sigh \u2018I suppose it was inevitable.\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019m glad she\u2019s married.",

    "But his silence persisted.",
    "It was getting dark and the air came sharp and cold but they did not turn\nback walked on and on without speaking.",
    "So they had often walked before \u2013\nsilent and happy.",
    "But this silence was different.",
    "There was weight in it and\nmenace.",

    "You are not sensitive in that way Mrs Deyre\u2019\nNell said that she didn\u2019t mind anything.",

    "And where should we all be without\ndiscipline\u2019\nIt shot through Nell\u2019s mind that Mrs Curtis had not had to endure any\ndiscipline which robbed her pronouncement of some of its impressiveness.",

    "\u2018I have a list of girls on the reserve\u2019 continued Mrs Curtis.",
    "\u2018I will add your\nname.",
    "Two days a week you will attend at the Out Patient ward at the Town\nHospital and thereby gain a little experience.",

    "She was very friendly to Nell explained that the days were Wednesday and\nSaturday and not Tuesday and Friday \u2013 \u2018But old Curtis always gets something\nwrong\u2019 \u2013 that the District Nurse was a dear and never jumped on you and that\nSister Margaret at the hospital was a holy terror.",

    "But halfeducated girls who think nursing is all smoothing a pillow and feeding the\npatient with grapes.",
    "You\u2019ll know your way about in no time.\u2019\nHeartened by this Nell presented herself at the Out Patient Department at the\ngiven time without too much trepidation.",
    "She was received by a tall gaunt Sister\nwith a malevolent eye.",
    "\u2018Another raw beginner\u2019 she grumbled.",

    "\u2018We haven\u2019t got all day here to do things in\u2019 she remarked.",
    "\u2018There leave it\nto me.",
    "You seem to be all thumbs.",
    "Soak the bandages off that kid\u2019s legs.",

    "She felt suddenly sick and faint.",
    "She couldn\u2019t do this work \u2013 she simply\ncouldn\u2019t do it.",
    "She drew back and as she did so she glanced up to find Sister\nMargaret watching her a gleam of malicious pleasure showing in her eye.",
    "\u2018I thought you couldn\u2019t stick it\u2019 that eye said.",
    "It rallied Nell as nothing else would have done.",
    "She bent her head and\nsetting her teeth went on with her job trying to avert her mind from the child\u2019s\nshrieks.",
    "It was done at last and Nell stood up white and trembling and feeling\ndeathly sick.",
    "Sister Margaret came along.",
    "She seemed disappointed.",

    "Next she assisted Sister to\nsyringe the ulcerated leg and after that stood by while a young doctor extracted\nthe needle from the girl\u2019s finger.",
    "As he probed and cut the girl winced and\nshrank and he spoke to her sharply.",
    "\u2018Keep quiet can\u2019t you\u2019\nNell thought \u2018One never sees this side of things.",

    "\u201cI\u2019m afraid this will hurt a little.",
    "Be as still as you can.\u201d\u2019\nThe young doctor proceeded to extract a couple of teeth flinging them\ncarelessly on the floor then he treated a smashed hand that had just come in\nfrom an accident.",
    "It was not Nell reflected that he was unskilful.",
    "It was the absence of manner\nthat was so disturbing to one\u2019s preconceived ideas.",
    "Whatever he did Sister\nMargaret accompanied him tittering in a sycophantic manner at any jokes he\nwas pleased to make.",
    "Of Nell he took no notice.",

    "\u2018How can you be anything else\u2019 said Sister Margaret.",
    "\u2018A lot of amateurs\nlike you Red Cross people.",
    "And thinking you know everything on earth.",
    "Well\n\n\fperhaps you\u2019ll be a little less clumsy next time\u2019\nSuch was Nell\u2019s encouraging d\u00e9but at the hospital.",
    "It grew less terrible as time went on however.",
    "Sister Margaret softened and\nrelaxed her attitude of fierce defensiveness.",
    "She even permitted herself to answer\nquestions.",
    "\u2018You\u2019re not so stuck up as most\u2019 she allowed graciously.",
    "Nell in her turn was impressed by the enormous amount of competent work\nSister Margaret managed to put in in a very short time.",
    "And she understood a\nlittle her soreness on the subject of amateurs.",
    "What struck Nell most was the enormous number of \u2018bad legs\u2019 and their\nprototypes most of them evidently old friends.",

    "He\u2019s afraid of\nminding so he says there\u2019s nothing to mind.",
    "If he\u2019d only admit that it\u2019s a bloody\nfilthy business like I do he\u2019d be all right.",
    "But it\u2019s like that old piano business \u2013\nhe won\u2019t look at the thing fair and square.",

    "Poor\nJane she must have made rather a mess of things to have come down to acting in\na touring company.",
    "One must be loyal to one\u2019s old friends Jane was an old friend.",

    "It was such terribly bad luck to have lost her voice\nand come down to this.",

    "But you were being so queenly and so gracious.",
    "I never can stand people\nbeing gracious.\u2019\nShe got up and began to stroll round the room.",
    "\u2018So this is Vernon\u2019s home\u2019 she said softly.",
    "\u2018I\u2019ve never seen it before \u2013 only\nheard him talk about it.\u2019\nShe was silent for a minute then asked abruptly\n\u2018How much have you changed\u2019\nNell explained that everything had been left as it was as far as possible.",
    "Curtains covers carpets etc.",
    "had all been renewed.",
    "The old ones were too\nshabby.",
    "And one or two priceless pieces of furniture had been added.",
    "Whenever\nGeorge came across anything that was in keeping with the place he bought it.",
    "Jane\u2019s eyes were fixed on her while she made this explanation and Nell felt\nuneasy because she couldn\u2019t read the expression in them.",
    "George came in before she had finished talking and they went in to lunch.",
    "The talk was at first of Serbia of a few mutual friends out there.",
    "Then they\npassed on to Jane\u2019s affairs.",

    "Jane passed it off carelessly\nenough.",
    "\u2018My own fault\u2019 she said.",
    "\u2018I would sing a certain kind of music and my voice\nwasn\u2019t made for it.\u2019\nSebastian Levinne she went on to say had been a wonderful friend.",
    "He was\nwilling now to star her in London but she had wished to learn her trade first.",
    "\u2018Singing in opera is of course acting too.",

    "And then one\u2019s effects are\nall different \u2013 they must be more subtle less broad.\u2019\nNext autumn she explained she was to appear in London in a dramatized\nversion of Tosca.",
    "Then dismissing her own affairs she began to talk of Abbots Puissants.",
    "She\nled George on to discuss his plans his ideas about the estate.",
    "He was made to\ndisplay himself the complete country squire.",
    "There was apparently no mockery in Jane\u2019s eyes or her voice but\nnevertheless Nell felt acutely uncomfortable.",
    "She wished George would stop\ntalking.",
    "It was a little ridiculous the way he spoke as though he and his\nforefathers before him had lived for centuries at Abbots Puissants.",
    "After coffee they went out on the terrace again and here George was\nsummoned to the telephone and left them with a word of excuse.",
    "Nell suggested\na tour through the gardens and Jane acquiesced.",

    "That\u2019s why she\u2019s come.",
    "But Vernon never meant to her what he meant to me\u2019\n\n\fShe had a passionate desire to vindicate herself \u2013 to make Jane see \u2013 See\nwhat She didn\u2019t quite know herself but she felt that Jane was judging her \u2013\ncondemning her even.",
    "She stopped suddenly as they were walking down a long herbaceous border\ngay with Michaelmas daisies against the old rosecoloured brick wall behind it.",
    "\u2018Jane.",
    "I want to tell you \u2013 to explain \u2013\u2019\nShe paused gathering herself together.",
    "Jane merely looked at her\ninquiringly.",
    "\u2018You must think it \u2013 very dreadful of me \u2013 marrying again so soon.\u2019\n\u2018Not at all\u2019 said Jane.",

    "That\u2019s what everybody goes about saying \u2013 but I never have seen that\nthey\u2019ve any foundation for that cheering belief.",

    "You\u2019d know best about that because you knew him\nbetter than anyone else.\u2019\n\u2018Yes\u2019 said Nell eagerly.",
    "\u2018That\u2019s just it.",
    "I know he would want me to be\nhappy.",

    "That\u2019s not quite the same thing.\u2019\n\u2018No but it isn\u2019t as though I were living here with George like \u2013 like it would\nhave been with him.",
    "Oh Jane I want to make you understand.",
    "George is a dear\nbut he isn\u2019t \u2013 he can never be \u2013 what \u2013 what Vernon was to me.\u2019\nThere was a long pause and then Jane said \u2018You\u2019re lucky Nell.\u2019\n\u2018If you think I really love all this luxury Why for Vernon I\u2019d give it up in a\nminute\u2019\n\u2018I wonder.\u2019\n\u2018Jane You \u2013\u2019\n\u2018You think you would \u2013 but \u2013 I wonder.\u2019\n\u2018I did before.\u2019\n\u2018No \u2013 you only gave up the prospect of it.",

    "What an idiot she was to have let herself be upset by Jane.",
    "Jane of all\npeople What did it matter what Jane said or thought It didn\u2019t of course \u2013 but\nthere was something about Jane \u2013 she had the power of \u2013 well \u2013 upsetting one.",

    "By the goldfish pond a young man in chauffeur\u2019s livery was standing with\nhis back to her.",

    "Funny the way you thought of things as having happened before Just for a\nminute Green could have sworn that he had once stood just where he was\nstanding now and seen the house outlined against a red sky.",
    "Could swear too\nthat he had felt just that same keen pang as of something that hurt.",
    "But it wanted\nsomething else \u2013 a woman with red hair like the sunset.",

    "It\u2019s possible I suppose for the War Office to have made\nan error\u2019\n\u2018Errors have been made more than once \u2013 but they\u2019ve usually been\ncontradicted fairly soon.",
    "It stands to reason that they must be.",

    "\u2018It\u2019s hard to explain.",
    "Rather happy and jolly and \u2013 just faintly \u2013 like his\nmother.\u2019\n\u2018Extraordinary\u2019 said Sebastian.",
    "\u2018I\u2019m glad you sent for me.",

    "We must hear what he\u2019s got to say.\u2019\nThere was a knock at the door and Mr Bleibner was announced.",
    "Jane rose to\nmeet him.",
    "\u2018It\u2019s very good of you to come Mr Bleibner\u2019 she began.",
    "\u2018Not at all\u2019 said the American.",
    "\u2018Always delighted to oblige a lady.",
    "And you\nsaid that the matter you wanted to see me about was urgent.\u2019\n\u2018It is.",

    "How long have you had your chauffeur and what can you tell us\nabout him\u2019\nMr Bleibner was plainly surprised and showed it.",
    "\u2018Green You want to know about Green\u2019\n\u2018Yes.\u2019\n\u2018Well \u2013\u2019 The American reflected.",
    "\u2018I\u2019ve no objections to telling you what I\nknow.",
    "I guess you wouldn\u2019t ask without a good reason.",
    "I know you well enough\nfor that Miss Harding.",
    "I picked up Green in Holland not long after the armistice.",
    "He was working in a local garage.",
    "I discovered he was an Englishman and began\nto take an interest in him.",
    "I asked him his history and he was pretty vague about\nit.",
    "I thought at first he had something to conceal but I soon convinced myself\nthat he was genuine enough.",
    "The man was in a kind of mental fog.",
    "He knew his\nname and where he came from but very little else.\u2019\n\u2018Lost memory\u2019 said Sebastian softly.",
    "\u2018I see.\u2019\n\u2018His father was killed in the South African war he told me.",
    "He remembered\nhis father singing in the village choir and he remembered a brother whom he\nused to call Squirrel.\u2019\n\u2018And he was quite sure about his own name\u2019\n\u2018Oh yes.",
    "As a matter of fact he\u2019d got it written down in a small pocket book.",
    "There was an accident you know.",
    "He was knocked down by a lorry.",
    "That\u2019s how\nthey knew who he was.",
    "They asked him if his name was Green and he said Yes \u2013\nGeorge.",
    "He was very popular at the garage he was so sunny and lighthearted.",
    "I\ndon\u2019t believe I\u2019ve ever seen Green out of temper.",
    "\u2018Well \u2013 I took a fancy to the young chap.",
    "I\u2019ve seen a few shellshocked\ncases and his state wasn\u2019t any mystery to me.",
    "He showed me the entry in his\npocket book and I made a few inquiries.",
    "I soon found the reason \u2013 there always\nis a reason you know \u2013 for his loss of memory.",
    "Corporal George Green London\n\n\fFusiliers was a deserter.",
    "\u2018There you have it.",
    "He\u2019d funked things \u2013 and being a decent young fellow\nreally he couldn\u2019t face the fact.",
    "I explained it all to him.",
    "He said \u2013 rather\nwonderingly \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have thought I could ever desert \u2013 not desert.\u201d I\nexplained to him that that point of view was just the reason he couldn\u2019t\nremember.",
    "He couldn\u2019t remember because he didn\u2019t want to remember.",
    "\u2018He listened but I don\u2019t think he was very convinced.",
    "I felt and still feel\nextremely sorry for him.",
    "I didn\u2019t think there was any obligation on my part to\nreport his existence to the military authorities.",
    "I took him into my service and\noffered him a chance to make good.",
    "I\u2019ve never had cause to regret it.",

    "\u2018It\u2019s frightening\u2019 said Jane in her low voice.",
    "\u2018It\u2019s one of the most frightening\nthings that could happen.\u2019\nSebastian took her hand and squeezed it.",
    "\u2018It\u2019s all right Jane.\u2019\nJane roused herself with a slight shiver and spoke to the American.",
    "\u2018I think it\u2019s our turn to explain.",
    "You see Mr Bleibner in your chauffeur I\nrecognized an old friend \u2013 and he didn\u2019t recognize me.\u2019\n\u2018In \u2013 deed\u2019\n\u2018But his name wasn\u2019t Green\u2019 said Sebastian.",
    "\u2018No You mean he enlisted under another name\u2019\n\u2018No.",
    "There\u2019s something there that seems incomprehensible.",
    "I suppose we\nshall get at it some day.",
    "In the meantime I will ask you Mr Bleibner not to\nrepeat this conversation to anyone.",
    "There\u2019s a wife in the matter \u2013 and \u2013 oh many\nother considerations.\u2019\n\u2018My dear sir\u2019 said Mr Bleibner.",
    "\u2018You can trust me to be absolutely silent.",
    "But what next Do you want to see Green\u2019\nSebastian looked at Jane and she bowed her head.",
    "\u2018Yes\u2019 said Sebastian slowly.",
    "\u2018I think perhaps that would be the best plan.\u2019\nThe American rose.",
    "\u2018He\u2019s below now.",
    "He brought me here.",
    "I\u2019ll send him up right away.\u2019\n\n2\n\n\fGeorge Green mounted the stairs with his usual buoyant step.",
    "As he did so he\nwondered what had happened to upset the old josser \u2013 by that term meaning his\nemployer.",
    "Very queer the old buffer had looked.",
    "\u2018The door at the top of the stairs\u2019 Mr Bleibner had said.",
    "George Green rapped on it sharply with his knuckles and waited.",
    "A voice\ncalled \u2018Come in\u2019 and he obeyed.",
    "There were two people in the room \u2013 the lady he had driven home yesterday\nwhom he thought of in his own mind as a tiptopper and a big rather fat man\nwith a very yellow face and projecting ears.",
    "His face seemed vaguely familiar to\nthe chauffeur.",
    "For a moment he stood there while they both stared at him.",
    "He\nthought \u2018What\u2019s the matter with everybody this evening\u2019\nHe said \u2018Yes sir\u2019 in a respectful voice to the yellow gentleman.",
    "He went\non \u2018Mr Bleibner told me to come up \u2013\u2019\nThe yellow gentleman seemed to recover himself.",
    "\u2018Yes yes\u2019 he said.",
    "\u2018That\u2019s right.",
    "Sit down \u2013 er \u2013 Green.",
    "That\u2019s your name\nisn\u2019t it\u2019\n\u2018Yes sir.",
    "George Green.\u2019\nHe sat down respectfully in the chair indicated.",
    "The yellow gentleman\nhanded him a cigarette case and said \u2018Help yourself.\u2019 And all the time his eyes\nsmall piercing eyes never left Green\u2019s face.",
    "That intent burning gaze made the\nchauffeur uneasy.",
    "What was up with everyone tonight\n\u2018I wanted to ask you a few questions.",
    "To begin with have you ever seen me\nbefore\u2019\nGreen shook his head.",
    "\u2018No sir.\u2019\n\u2018Sure\u2019 persisted the other.",
    "A faint trace of uncertainty crept into Green\u2019s voice.",
    "\u2018I \u2013 I don\u2019t think so\u2019 he said doubtfully.",
    "\u2018My name is Sebastian Levinne.\u2019\nThe chauffeur\u2019s face cleared.",
    "\u2018Of course sir I\u2019ve seen your picture in the papers.",
    "I thought it seemed\nfamiliar somehow.\u2019\nThere was a pause and then Sebastian Levinne asked casually\n\u2018Have you ever heard the name of Vernon Deyre\u2019\n\u2018Vernon Deyre\u2019 Green repeated the name thoughtfully.",
    "He frowned\nperplexedly.",
    "\u2018The name seems somehow familiar to me sir but I can\u2019t quite\nplace it.\u2019 He paused the frown deepening.",
    "\u2018I think I\u2019ve heard it.\u2019 And then\n\n\fadded \u2018The gentleman\u2019s dead isn\u2019t he\u2019\n\u2018So that\u2019s your impression is it That the gentleman is dead.\u2019\n\u2018Yes sir and a good \u2013\u2019\nHe stopped suddenly crimsoning.",
    "\u2018Go on\u2019 said Levinne.",
    "\u2018What were you going to say\u2019 He added shrewdly\nperceiving where the trouble lay \u2018You need not mince your words.",
    "Mr Deyre\nwas no relation of mine.\u2019\nThe chauffeur accepted the implication.",
    "\u2018I was going to say a good job too \u2013 but I don\u2019t know that I ought to say it\nsince I can\u2019t remember anything about him.",
    "But I\u2019ve got a kind of impression\nthat \u2013 well that he was best out of the way so to speak.",
    "Made rather a mess of\nthings hadn\u2019t he\u2019\n\u2018You knew him\u2019\nThe frown deepened in an agony of attempted recollection.",
    "\u2018I\u2019m sorry sir\u2019 the chauffeur apologized.",
    "\u2018Since the war things seemed to\nhave got a bit mixed up.",
    "I can\u2019t always recollect things clearly.",
    "I don\u2019t know\nwhere I came across Mr Deyre and why I disliked him but I do know that I\u2019m\nthankful to hear that he\u2019s dead.",
    "He was no good \u2013 you can take my word for\nthat.\u2019\nThere was a silence \u2013 only broken by something like a smothered sob from\nthe other occupant of the room.",
    "Levinne turned to her.",
    "\u2018Telephone to the theatre Jane\u2019 he said.",
    "\u2018You can\u2019t appear tonight.\u2019\nShe nodded and left the room.",
    "Levinne looked after her and then said\nabruptly \u2018You\u2019ve seen Miss Harding before\u2019\n\u2018Yes sir.",
    "I drove her home today.\u2019\nLevinne sighed.",
    "Green looked at him inquiringly.",
    "\u2018Is \u2013 is that all sir I\u2019m sorry to have been so little use.",
    "I know I\u2019ve been a\nbit \u2013 well queer since the war.",
    "My own fault.",
    "Perhaps Mr Bleibner told you \u2013 I \u2013\nI didn\u2019t do my duty as I should have done.\u2019\nHis face flushed but he brought out the words resolutely.",
    "Had the old josser\ntold them or not Better to say that anyway.",
    "At the same time a pang of shame\npierced him keenly.",
    "He was a deserter \u2013 a man who had run away A rotten\nbusiness.",
    "Jane Harding came back into the room and resumed her place behind the\ntable.",
    "She looked paler than when she had gone out Green thought.",
    "Curious eyes\nshe had \u2013 so deep and tragic.",
    "He wondered what she was thinking about.",
    "Perhaps\nshe had been engaged to this Mr Deyre.",
    "No Mr Levinne wouldn\u2019t have urged\n\n\fhim to speak out if that had been the case.",
    "It was probably all to do with money.",
    "A will or something like that.",
    "Mr Levinne began questioning him again.",
    "He made no reference to the last\nsentence.",
    "\u2018Your father was killed in the Boer War I believe\u2019\n\u2018Yes sir.\u2019\n\u2018You remember him\u2019\n\u2018Oh yes sir.\u2019\n\u2018What did he look like\u2019\nGreen smiled.",
    "The memory was pleasant to him.",
    "\u2018A burly sort of chap.",
    "Mutton chop whiskers.",
    "Very bright blue eyes.",

    "\u2018It\u2019s queer\u2019 he said.",
    "\u2018I never thought of that.",

    "\u2018You seem very certain about that\u2019 said Mr Levinne smiling.",
    "\u2018I am sir.",
    "It leads to nothing but trouble \u2013 mixing yourself up with women.\u2019\nHe stopped abruptly and said to Jane \u2018I beg your pardon.\u2019\nShe smiled faintly and said \u2018It doesn\u2019t matter.\u2019\nThere was a pause.",
    "Levinne turned to her and said something so quickly that\nGreen could not catch it.",
    "It sounded like \u2018Extraordinary likeness to Sydney\nBent.",
    "Never imagined it was there.\u2019\nThen they both stared at him again.",
    "And suddenly he was afraid \u2013 definitely childishly afraid \u2013 in the same way\nthat he remembered being afraid of the dark when he was a baby.",
    "There was\nsomething up \u2013 that was how he put it to himself \u2013 and these two knew it.",
    "Something about him.",
    "He leant forward \u2013 acutely apprehensive.",
    "\u2018What\u2019s the matter\u2019 he said sharply.",
    "\u2018There\u2019s something \u2026\u2019\nThey didn\u2019t deny it \u2013 just continued to look at him.",
    "And his terror grew.",
    "Why couldn\u2019t they tell a chap They knew something\nthat he didn\u2019t.",
    "Something dreadful \u2026 He said again and this time his voice was\nhigh and shrill \u2018What\u2019s the matter\u2019\nThe lady got up \u2013 he noticed in the background of his mind as it were how\nsplendidly she moved.",
    "She was like a statue he\u2019d seen somewhere \u2013 she came\nround the table and laid a hand on his shoulder.",
    "She said comfortingly and\nreassuringly \u2018It\u2019s all right.",
    "You mustn\u2019t be frightened.\u2019\nBut Green\u2019s eyes continued to question Levinne.",
    "This man knew \u2013 this man\nwas going to tell him.",
    "What was this horrible thing that they knew and he didn\u2019t\n\u2018Very odd things have happened in this war\u2019 began Levinne.",
    "\u2018People have\nsometimes forgotten their own names.\u2019\nHe paused significantly but the significance was lost on Green.",
    "He said with\na momentary return to cheerfulness \u2018I\u2019m not as bad as that.",
    "I\u2019ve never forgotten\nmy name.\u2019\n\u2018But you have.\u2019 He stopped \u2013 then went on \u2018Your real name is Vernon\nDeyre.\u2019\nThe announcement ought to have been dramatic but it wasn\u2019t.",
    "The words\nseemed to Green simply silly.",
    "He looked amused.",
    "\u2018I\u2019m Mr Vernon Deyre You mean I\u2019m his double or something\u2019\n\u2018I mean you are him.\u2019\nGreen laughed frankly.",
    "\u2018I can\u2019t monkey about with that stuff sir.",
    "Not even if it means a title or a\nfortune Whatever the resemblance I\u2019d be bound to be found out.\u2019\nSebastian Levinne leant forward over the table and rapped out each word\nseparately with emphasis \u2018You \u2013 are \u2013 Vernon \u2013 Deyre \u2026\u2019\nGreen stared.",
    "The emphasis impressed him.",
    "\u2018You\u2019re kidding me\u2019\nLevinne slowly shook his head.",
    "Green turned suddenly to the woman who\nstood beside him.",
    "Her eyes very grave and absolutely assured met his.",
    "She said\nvery quietly \u2018You are Vernon Deyre.",
    "We both know it.\u2019\nThere was dead silence in the room.",
    "To Green it seemed as though the\nwhole world was spinning round.",
    "It was like a fairy story fantastic and\nimpossible.",
    "And yet something about these two compelled credence.",
    "He said\nuncertainly \u2018But \u2013 but things don\u2019t happen like that.",
    "You couldn\u2019t forget your\nown name\u2019\n\u2018Evidently \u2013 since you have done so.\u2019\n\u2018But \u2013 but look here sir \u2013 I know I\u2019m George Green.",
    "I \u2013 well \u2013 I just know\n\n\fit\u2019\nHe looked at them triumphantly but slowly and remorselessly Sebastian\nLevinne shook his head.",
    "\u2018I don\u2019t know how that\u2019s come about\u2019 he said.",
    "\u2018A doctor would probably be\nable to tell you.",
    "But I do know this \u2013 that you are my friend Vernon Deyre.",
    "There is no possible doubt of that.\u2019\n\u2018But \u2013 but if that\u2019s true I ought to know it.\u2019\nHe felt bewildered horribly uncertain.",
    "A strange sickening world where you\ncouldn\u2019t be sure of anything.",
    "These were kindly sane people \u2013 he trusted them \u2013\nwhat they said must be so \u2013 and yet something in him refused to be convinced.",
    "They were sorry for him \u2013 he felt that.",
    "And that frightened him.",
    "There was\nsomething more yet \u2013 something that he hadn\u2019t been told.",
    "\u2018Who is he\u2019 he said sharply.",
    "\u2018This Vernon Deyre I mean.\u2019\n\u2018You come from this part of the world.",
    "You were born and spent most of\nyour childhood at a place called Abbots Puissants \u2013\u2019\nGreen interrupted him in astonishment.",
    "\u2018Abbots Puissants Why I drove Mr Bleibner there yesterday.",
    "And you say\nit\u2019s my old home and I never recognized it\u2019\nHe felt suddenly buoyed up and scornful.",
    "The whole thing was a pack of\nlies Of course it was He had known it all the time.",
    "These people were honest\nbut they were mistaken.",
    "He felt relieved \u2013 happier.",
    "\u2018After that you went to live near Birmingham\u2019 continued Levinne.",
    "\u2018You\nwent to school at Eton and from there you went on to Cambridge.",
    "After that you\nwent to London and studied music.",
    "You composed an opera.\u2019\nGreen laughed outright.",
    "\u2018There you\u2019re quite wrong sir.",
    "Why I don\u2019t know one note of music from\nanother.\u2019\n\u2018The war broke out.",
    "You obtained a commission in the Yeomanry.",
    "You were\nmarried \u2013\u2019 he paused but Green gave no sign \u2018and went out to France.",
    "In the\nspring of the following year you were reported \u201cKilled in Action\u201d.\u2019\nGreen stared at him incredulously.",
    "What sort of a rigmarole was this He\ncouldn\u2019t remember a thing about any of it.",
    "\u2018There must be some mistake\u2019 he said confidently.",
    "\u2018Mr Deyre must have\nbeen what they call my \u201cdouble\u201d.\u2019\n\u2018There is no mistake Vernon\u2019 said Jane Harding.",
    "Green looked from her to Sebastian.",
    "The confident intimacy of her tone had\ndone more to convince him than anything else.",
    "He thought \u2018This is awful.",
    "A\n\n\fnightmare.",
    "Such things can\u2019t happen.\u2019 He began to shake all over unable to stop.",
    "Levinne got up mixed him a stiff drink from materials that stood on a tray in\nthe corner and brought it back to him.",
    "\u2018Swallow this\u2019 he said.",
    "\u2018And you\u2019ll feel better.",
    "It\u2019s been a shock.\u2019\nGreen gulped down the draught.",
    "It steadied him.",
    "The trembling ceased.",
    "\u2018Before God sir\u2019 he said.",
    "\u2018Is this true\u2019\n\u2018Before God it is\u2019 said Sebastian.",
    "He brought a chair forward sat down close by his friend.",
    "\u2018Vernon dear old chap \u2013 don\u2019t you remember me at all\u2019\nGreen stared at him \u2013 an anguished stare.",
    "Something seemed to stir ever so\nfaintly.",
    "How it hurt this trying to remember.",
    "There was something \u2013 what was\nit He said doubtfully \u2018You \u2013 you\u2019ve grown up.\u2019 He stretched out a hand and\ntouched Sebastian\u2019s ear.",
    "\u2018I seem to remember \u2013\u2019\n\u2018He remembers your ears Sebastian\u2019 cried Jane and going over to the\nmantelpiece she laid her head down upon it and began to laugh.",
    "\u2018Stop it Jane.\u2019 Sebastian rose poured out another drink and took it to her.",
    "\u2018Some medicine for you.\u2019\nShe drank it handed the glass back to him smiled faintly and said\n\u2018I\u2019m sorry.",
    "I won\u2019t do it again.\u2019\nGreen was going on with his discoveries.",
    "\u2018You\u2019re \u2013 you\u2019re not a brother are you No you lived next door.",
    "That\u2019s it \u2013\nyou lived next door \u2026\u2019\n\u2018That\u2019s right old chap.\u2019 Sebastian patted him on the shoulder.",
    "\u2018Don\u2019t worry\nto think \u2013 it\u2019ll come back soon.",
    "Take it easy.\u2019\nGreen looked at Jane.",
    "He said timidly and politely\n\u2018Were you \u2013 are you \u2013 my sister I seem to remember something about a\nsister.\u2019\nJane shook her head unable to speak.",
    "Green flushed.",
    "\u2018I\u2019m sorry.",
    "I shouldn\u2019t have \u2013\u2019\nSebastian interrupted.",
    "\u2018You didn\u2019t have a sister.",
    "There was a cousin who lived with you.",
    "Her name\nwas Josephine.",
    "We called her Joe.\u2019\nGreen pondered.",
    "\u2018Josephine \u2013 Joe.",
    "Yes I seem to remember something about that.\u2019 He paused\nand then reiterated pathetically \u2018Are you sure my name isn\u2019t Green\u2019\n\u2018Quite sure.",
    "Do you still feel it is\u2019\n\u2018Yes \u2026 And you say I make up music \u2013 music of my own Highbrow stuff \u2013\n\n\fnot ragtime\u2019\n\u2018Yes.\u2019\n\u2018It all seems \u2013 well mad.",
    "Just that \u2013 mad\u2019\n\u2018You mustn\u2019t worry\u2019 said Jane gently.",
    "\u2018I dare say we have been wrong to tell\nyou all this the way we have.\u2019\nGreen looked from one to the other of them.",
    "He felt dazed.",
    "\u2018What am I to do\u2019 he asked helplessly.",
    "Sebastian gave an answer with decision.",
    "\u2018You must stay here with us.",
    "You\u2019ve had a great shock you know.",
    "I\u2019ll go\nand square things with old Bleibner.",
    "He\u2019s a very decent chap and he\u2019ll\nunderstand.\u2019\n\u2018I shouldn\u2019t like to put him out in any way.",
    "He\u2019s been a thundering good\nboss to me.\u2019\n\u2018He\u2019ll understand.",
    "I\u2019ve already told him something.\u2019\n\u2018What about the car I don\u2019t like to think of another chap driving that car.",
    "She\u2019s running now as sweetly \u2013\u2019\nHe was once again the chauffeur intent on his charge.",
    "\u2018I know.",
    "I know.\u2019 Sebastian was impatient.",
    "\u2018But the great thing my dear\nfellow is to get you right as soon as possible.",
    "We want to get a firstclass doctor\non to you.\u2019\n\u2018What\u2019s a doctor got to do with it\u2019 Green was slightly hostile.",
    "\u2018I\u2019m perfectly\nfit.\u2019\n\u2018Perhaps a doctor ought to see you all the same.",
    "Not here \u2013 in London.",
    "We\ndon\u2019t want any talk down here.\u2019\nSomething in the tone of the speaker\u2019s voice attracted Green\u2019s attention.",
    "The\nflush came over his face.",
    "\u2018You mean the deserting business \u2026\u2019\n\u2018No no.",
    "To tell the truth I can\u2019t get the hang of that.",
    "I mean something quite\ndifferent.\u2019\nGreen looked at him inquiringly.",
    "Sebastian thought \u2018Well I suppose he\u2019s got to know some time.\u2019 Aloud he\nsaid \u2018You see \u2013 thinking you were dead \u2013 your wife has \u2013 well \u2013 married again.\u2019\nHe was a little afraid of the effect of those words.",
    "But Green seemed to see\nthe matter in a humorous light.",
    "\u2018That is a bit awkward\u2019 he said with a grin.",
    "\u2018It doesn\u2019t upset you in any way\u2019\n\u2018You can\u2019t be upset by a thing you don\u2019t remember.\u2019 He paused as though\n\n\freally considering the matter for the first time.",
    "\u2018Was Mr Deyre \u2013 I mean was I \u2013\nfond of her\u2019\n\u2018Well \u2013 yes.\u2019\nBut again the grin came over Green\u2019s face.",
    "\u2018And I to be so positive I wasn\u2019t married All the same \u2013\u2019 his face changed \u2013\n\u2018it\u2019s rather frightening \u2013 all this\u2019\nHe looked suddenly at Jane as though seeking assurance.",
    "\u2018Dear Vernon\u2019 she said \u2018it will be all right.\u2019\nShe paused and then said in a quiet casual tone\n\u2018You drove Mr Bleibner over to Abbots Puissants you say.",
    "Did you \u2013 did\nyou see anyone there Any of the people of the house\u2019\n\u2018I saw Mr Chetwynd \u2013 and I saw a lady in the sunk gardens.",
    "I took her to be\nMrs Chetwynd fairhaired and goodlooking.\u2019\n\u2018Did \u2013 did she see you\u2019\n\u2018Yes.",
    "Seemed \u2013 well scared.",
    "Went dead white and bolted like a rabbit.\u2019\n\u2018Oh God\u2019 said Jane and bit off the exclamation almost before it was\nuttered.",
    "Green was cogitating quietly over the matter.",
    "\u2018Perhaps she thought she knew me\u2019 he said.",
    "\u2018She must have been one of\nthem who knew him \u2013 me \u2013 in the old days and it gave her a turn.",
    "Yes that must\nhave been it.\u2019\nHe was quite happy with his solution.",
    "Suddenly he asked\n\u2018Had my mother got red hair\u2019\nJane nodded.",
    "\u2018Then that was it \u2026\u2019 He looked up apologetically.",
    "\u2018Sorry.",
    "I was just thinking\nof something.\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019ll go and see Bleibner now\u2019 said Sebastian.",
    "\u2018Jane will look after you.\u2019\nHe left the room.",
    "Green leant forward in his chair his head held between his\nhands.",
    "He felt acutely uncomfortable and miserable \u2013 especially with Jane.",
    "Clearly he ought to know her \u2013 and he didn\u2019t.",
    "She had said \u2018Dear Vernon\u2019 just\nnow.",
    "It was terribly awkward when people knew you and you felt they were\nstrangers.",
    "If he spoke to her he supposed he ought to call her Jane \u2013 but he\ncouldn\u2019t.",
    "She was a stranger.",
    "Still he supposed he\u2019d have to get used to it.",
    "They\u2019d have to be Sebastian and George and Jane together \u2013 no not George \u2013\nVernon.",
    "Silly sort of name Vernon.",
    "Probably he\u2019d been a silly sort of chap.",
    "\u2018I mean\u2019 he thought trying desperately to force the realization upon himself\n\n\f\u2018I must have been a silly sort of chap.\u2019\nHe felt horribly lonely \u2013 cut off from reality.",
    "He looked up to find Jane\nwatching him and the pity and understanding in her eyes made him feel a shade\nless forlorn.",
    "\u2018It\u2019s rather terrible just at first isn\u2019t it\u2019 she said.",
    "He said politely\n\u2018It is rather difficult.",
    "You don\u2019t \u2013 you don\u2019t know where you are with\nthings.\u2019\n\u2018I understand.\u2019\nShe said no more \u2013 just sat there quietly beside him.",
    "His head jerked\nforward.",
    "He began to doze.",
    "In reality he only slept for a few minutes but it\nseemed to him hours.",
    "Jane had turned all the lamps out but one.",
    "He woke with a\nstart.",
    "She said quickly \u2018It\u2019s all right.\u2019\nHe stared at her his breath coming in gasps.",
    "He was still in the nightmare\nthen he hadn\u2019t woken up.",
    "And there was something worse to come \u2013 something\nhe didn\u2019t know yet.",
    "He was sure of it.",
    "That was why they all looked at him so\npityingly.",
    "Jane got up suddenly.",
    "Wildly he cried out\n\u2018Stay with me.",
    "Oh please stay with me.\u2019\nHe couldn\u2019t understand why her face should suddenly twist with pain.",
    "What\nwas there in what he had said to make her look like that He said again \u2018Don\u2019t\nleave me.",
    "Stay with me.\u2019\nShe sat down again beside him and took his hand in hers.",
    "She said very\ngently \u2018I won\u2019t go away.\u2019\nHe felt soothed \u2013 reassured.",
    "After a minute or two he dozed again.",
    "He woke\nquietly this time.",
    "The room was as before and his hand was still in Jane\u2019s.",
    "He\nspoke diffidently \u2018You \u2013 you aren\u2019t my sister You were \u2013 you are I mean \u2013 a\nfriend of mine\u2019\n\u2018Yes.\u2019\n\u2018A great friend\u2019\n\u2018A great friend.\u2019\nHe paused.",
    "Yet the conviction in his mind was growing stronger and\nstronger.",
    "He blurted out suddenly \u2018You\u2019re \u2013 you\u2019re my wife aren\u2019t you\u2019\nHe was sure of it.",
    "She drew her hand away.",
    "He couldn\u2019t understand the look in her face.",
    "It\nfrightened him.",
    "She got up.",
    "\u2018No\u2019 she said.",
    "\u2018I\u2019m not your wife.\u2019\n\n\f\u2018Oh I\u2019m sorry.",
    "I thought \u2013\u2019\n\u2018It\u2019s all right.\u2019\nAnd at that minute Sebastian came back.",
    "His eyes went to Jane.",
    "She said\nwith a little twisted smile \u2018I\u2019m glad you\u2019ve come \u2026 I\u2019m \u2013 glad you\u2019ve\ncome \u2026\u2019\n\n3\nJane and Sebastian talked long into the night.",
    "What was to be done Who was to\nbe told\nThere was Nell and Nell\u2019s position to consider.",
    "Presumably Nell should be\ntold first of all.",
    "She was the one most vitally concerned.",
    "Jane agreed.",
    "\u2018If she doesn\u2019t know already.\u2019\n\u2018You think she knows\u2019\n\u2018Well evidently she met Vernon that day face to face.\u2019\n\u2018Yes but she must have thought it just a very strong resemblance.\u2019\nJane was silent.",
    "\u2018Don\u2019t you think so\u2019\n\u2018I don\u2019t know.\u2019\n\u2018But hang it all Jane if she\u2019d recognized him she\u2019d have done something \u2013\ngot hold of him or of Bleibner.",
    "It\u2019s two days ago now.\u2019\n\u2018I know.\u2019\n\u2018She can\u2019t have recognized him.",
    "She just saw Bleibner\u2019s chauffeur and his\nlikeness to Vernon gave her such a shock that she couldn\u2019t stand it and rushed\naway.\u2019\n\u2018I suppose so.\u2019\n\u2018What\u2019s in your mind Jane\u2019\n\u2018We recognized him Sebastian.\u2019\n\u2018You mean you did.",
    "I\u2019d been told by you.\u2019\n\u2018But you would have known him anywhere wouldn\u2019t you\u2019\n\u2018Yes I would \u2026 But then I know him so well.\u2019\nJane said in a hard voice \u2018So does Nell \u2026\u2019\nSebastian looked sharply at her and said \u2018What are you getting at Jane\u2019\n\u2018I don\u2019t know.\u2019\n\u2018Yes you do.",
    "What do you really think happened\u2019\nJane paused before speaking.",
    "\u2018I think Nell came upon him suddenly in the garden and thought it was\nVernon.",
    "Afterwards she persuaded herself that it had only been a chance\n\n\fresemblance that had upset her so.\u2019\n\u2018Well \u2013 that\u2019s very much what I said.\u2019\nHe was a little surprised when she said meekly\n\u2018Yes it is.\u2019\n\u2018What\u2019s the difference\u2019\n\u2018Practically none only \u2013\u2019\n\u2018Yes\u2019\n\u2018You and I would have wanted to believe it was Vernon even if it wasn\u2019t.\u2019\n\u2018Wouldn\u2019t Nell Surely she hasn\u2019t come to care for George Chetwynd to\nsuch an extent \u2013\u2019\n\u2018Nell is very fond of George but Vernon is the only person she\u2019s ever been\nin love with.\u2019\n\u2018Then that\u2019s all right.",
    "Or is it worse that way It\u2019s the deuce of a tangle \u2026\nWhat about his people Mrs Deyre and the Bents\u2019\nJane said decidedly \u2018Nell must be told before they are.",
    "Mrs Deyre will\nbroadcast it over England as soon as she knows and that will be very unfair to\nboth Vernon and Nell.\u2019\n\u2018Yes I think you\u2019re right.",
    "Now my plan is this.",
    "To take Vernon up to town\ntomorrow and go and see a specialist \u2013 then be guided by what he advises.\u2019\nJane said Yes she thought that would be the best plan.",
    "She got up to go to\nbed.",
    "On the stairs she paused and said to Sebastian \u2018I wonder if we\u2019re right.",
    "Bringing him back I mean.",
    "He looked so happy.",
    "Oh Sebastian he looked so\nhappy \u2026\u2019\n\u2018As George Green you mean\u2019\n\u2018Yes.",
    "Are you sure we\u2019re right\u2019\n\u2018Yes I\u2019m pretty sure.",
    "It can\u2019t be right for anyone to be in that unnatural sort\nof state.\u2019\n\u2018I suppose it is unnatural.",
    "The queer thing is he looked so normal and\ncommonplace.",
    "And happy \u2013 that\u2019s what I can\u2019t get over Sebastian \u2013 happy \u2026\nWe\u2019re none of us very happy are we\u2019\nHe couldn\u2019t answer that.",
    "Chapter Three\n1\nTwo days later Sebastian came to Abbots Puissants.",
    "The butler was not sure that\nMrs Chetwynd could see him.",
    "She was lying down.",
    "Sebastian gave his name and said he was sure Mrs Chetwynd would see him.",
    "He was shown into the drawingroom to wait.",
    "The room seemed very empty and\nsilent but unusually luxurious \u2013 very different from what it had looked in his\nchildish days.",
    "He thought to himself \u2018It was a real house then\u2019 and wondered\nwhat exactly he meant by that.",
    "He got it presently.",
    "Now it suggested very\nfaintly a museum.",
    "Everything was beautifully arranged and harmonized\nperfectly every piece that was not perfect had been replaced by one that was.",
    "All\nthe carpets and covers and hangings were new.",
    "\u2018And they must have cost a pretty penny\u2019 thought Sebastian appreciatively\nand priced them with a fair degree of accuracy.",
    "He always knew the cost of\nthings.",
    "He was interrupted in this salutary exercise by the door opening.",
    "Nell came\nin a pink colour in her cheeks and her hand outstretched.",
    "\u2018Sebastian What a surprise I thought you were too busy ever to leave\nLondon except at a weekend \u2013 and not often then\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019ve lost just twenty thousand pounds in the last two days\u2019 said Sebastian\ngruffly as he took her hand.",
    "\u2018Simply from gadding about and letting things go\nanyhow.",
    "How are you Nell\u2019\n\u2018Oh I\u2019m feeling splendid.\u2019\nShe didn\u2019t look very splendid though he thought now that the flush of\nsurprise had died away.",
    "Besides hadn\u2019t the butler said she was lying down not\nfeeling well He fancied that her face looked a little strained and haggard.",
    "She went on\n\u2018Sit down Sebastian.",
    "You look as though you were on the point of going off\nto catch a train.",
    "George is away \u2013 in Spain.",
    "He had to go on business.",
    "He\u2019ll be\naway a week at least.\u2019\n\u2018Will he\u2019\n\n\fThat was a good thing anyway.",
    "A damned awkward business.",
    "Nell had\nsimply no idea \u2026\n\u2018You\u2019re very glum Sebastian.",
    "Is anything the matter\u2019\nShe asked the question quite lightly but he seized upon it eagerly.",
    "It was the\nopening he needed.",
    "\u2018Yes Nell\u2019 he said gravely.",
    "\u2018As a matter of fact there is.\u2019\nHe heard her draw in her breath with a sudden catch.",
    "Her eyes looked\nwatchful.",
    "\u2018What is it\u2019 she said.",
    "Her voice sounded different \u2013 hard and suspicious.",
    "\u2018I\u2019m afraid what I\u2019m going to say will be a great shock to you.",
    "It\u2019s about\nVernon.\u2019\n\u2018What about Vernon\u2019\nSebastian waited a minute.",
    "Then he said\n\u2018Vernon \u2013 is alive Nell.\u2019\n\u2018Alive\u2019 she whispered.",
    "Her hand crept up to her heart.",
    "\u2018Yes.\u2019\nShe didn\u2019t do any of the things he expected her to do \u2013 didn\u2019t faint or cry\nout or ask eager questions.",
    "She just stared straight ahead of her.",
    "And a sudden\nquick suspicion came into his shrewd Jewish mind.",
    "\u2018You knew it\u2019\n\u2018No no.\u2019\n\u2018I thought perhaps you saw him \u2013 the other day \u2013 when he came here\u2019\n\u2018Then it was Vernon\u2019\nIt broke from her like a cry.",
    "Sebastian nodded his head.",
    "It was as he had\nthought and said to Jane.",
    "She had not trusted her eyes.",
    "\u2018What did you think \u2013 that it was a very close resemblance\u2019\n\u2018Yes \u2013 yes that\u2019s what I thought.",
    "How could I think it was Vernon He\nlooked at me and didn\u2019t know me.\u2019\n\u2018He\u2019s lost his memory Nell.\u2019\n\u2018Lost his memory\u2019\n\u2018Yes.\u2019\nHe told her the story giving the details as carefully as possible.",
    "She listened\nbut paid less attention than he expected.",
    "When he had finished she said \u2018Yes \u2013\nbut what\u2019s to be done about it all Will he get it back What are we to do\u2019\nHe explained that Vernon was having treatment from a specialist.",
    "Already\nunder hypnosis part of the lost memory had returned.",
    "The whole process would\n\n\fnot be long delayed.",
    "He did not enter into the technical details judging rightly\nthat these would have no interest for her.",
    "\u2018And then he\u2019ll know \u2013 everything\u2019\n\u2018Yes.\u2019\nShe shrank back in her chair.",
    "He felt a sudden rush of pity.",
    "\u2018He can\u2019t blame you Nell.",
    "You didn\u2019t know \u2013 nobody could know.",
    "The\nreport of his death was absolutely definite.",
    "It\u2019s an almost unique case.",
    "I\u2019ve heard\nof one other.",
    "In most cases of course a report of death was contradicted almost\nimmediately.",
    "Vernon loves you enough to understand and forgive.\u2019\nShe said nothing but she put up both hands to cover her face.",
    "\u2018We think \u2013 if you agree \u2013 that everything had better be kept quiet for the\npresent.",
    "You\u2019ll tell Chetwynd of course.",
    "And you and he and Vernon can \u2013 well\nthrash it out together \u2013\u2019\n\u2018Don\u2019t Don\u2019t Don\u2019t go into details.",
    "Just let\u2019s leave it for the present \u2013 till\nI\u2019ve seen Vernon.\u2019\n\u2018Do you want to see him at once Will you come up to town with me\u2019\n\u2018No \u2013 I can\u2019t do that.",
    "Let him come here \u2013 to see me.",
    "Nobody will recognize\nhim.",
    "The servants are all new.\u2019\nSebastian said slowly \u2018Very well \u2026 I\u2019ll tell him.\u2019\nNell got up.",
    "\u2018I \u2013 I \u2013 you must go away now Sebastian.",
    "I can\u2019t bear any more.",
    "I can\u2019t\nindeed.",
    "It\u2019s all so dreadful.",
    "And only two days ago \u2018I was so happy and\npeaceful \u2026\u2019\n\u2018But Nell \u2013 surely to have Vernon back again.\u2019\n\u2018Oh yes I didn\u2019t mean that.",
    "You don\u2019t understand.",
    "That\u2019s wonderful of\ncourse.",
    "Oh do go Sebastian.",
    "It\u2019s awful of me turning you out like this but I\ncan\u2019t bear any more.",
    "You must go.\u2019\nSebastian went.",
    "On the way back to town he wondered a good deal.",
    "2\nLeft alone Nell went back to her bedroom and lay down on her bed pulling the\nsilk eiderdown tightly over her.",
    "So it was true after all.",
    "It had been Vernon.",
    "She had told herself that it\ncouldn\u2019t be \u2013 that she had made a ridiculous mistake.",
    "But she\u2019d been uneasy\never since.",
    "What was going to happen What would George say about it all Poor\n\n\fGeorge.",
    "He\u2019d been so good to her.",
    "Of course there were women who\u2019d married again and then had found their\nfirst husbands were alive.",
    "Rather an awful position.",
    "She had never really been\nGeorge\u2019s wife at all.",
    "Oh it couldn\u2019t be true.",
    "Such things didn\u2019t happen.",
    "God wouldn\u2019t let \u2013 But\nperhaps she had better not think of God.",
    "It reminded her of those very unpleasant\nthings that Jane had said the other day.",
    "That very same day.",
    "She thought with a rush of selfpity \u2018I was so happy \u2026\u2019\nWas Vernon going to understand Would he \u2013 perhaps \u2013 blame her He\u2019d\nwant her of course to come back.",
    "Or wouldn\u2019t he \u2013 now that she and George \u2013\nWhat did men think\nThere could be a divorce of course and then she could marry George.",
    "But\nthat would make a lot of talk.",
    "How difficult everything was.",
    "She thought with a sudden shock \u2018But I love Vernon.",
    "How can I\ncontemplate a divorce and marrying George when I love Vernon He\u2019s been\ngiven back to me \u2013 from the dead.\u2019\nShe turned over restlessly on the bed.",
    "It was a beautiful Empire bed.",
    "George\nhad bought it out of an old ch\u00e2teau in France.",
    "It was perfect and quite unique.",
    "She looked round the room \u2013 a charming room everything in harmony \u2013 perfect\ntaste perfect unostentatious luxury.",
    "She remembered suddenly the horsehair sofa and the antimacassars in the\nfurnished rooms at Wiltsbury.",
    "\u2026 Dreadful But they had been happy there.",
    "But now She looked round the room with new eyes.",
    "Of course Abbots\nPuissants belonged to George.",
    "Or didn\u2019t it now that Vernon had come back\nAnyway Vernon would be just as poor as ever \u2013 they couldn\u2019t afford to live\nhere \u2026 there were all the things that George had done to it \u2026 thought after\nthought raced confusedly through her brain.",
    "She must write to George \u2013 beg him to come home.",
    "Just say it was urgent \u2013\nnothing more.",
    "He was so clever.",
    "He might see a way.",
    "Or perhaps she wouldn\u2019t write to him \u2013 not till she had seen Vernon.",
    "Would\nVernon be very angry How terrible it all was.",
    "The tears came to her eyes.",
    "She sobbed \u2018It\u2019s unfair \u2013 it\u2019s unfair \u2013 I\u2019ve never\ndone anything.",
    "Why should this happen to me Vernon will blame me and I\ncouldn\u2019t know.",
    "How could I know\u2019\nAgain the thought flitted across her mind\n\u2018I was so happy\u2019\n\n\f3\nVernon was listening trying to understand what the doctor was saying to him.",
    "He looked across the table at him.",
    "A tall thin man with eyes that seemed to see\nright into the centre of you and to read there things that you didn\u2019t even know\nabout yourself.",
    "And he made you see all the things you didn\u2019t want to see.",
    "Made you bring\nthings up out of the depths.",
    "He was saying \u2018Now that you have remembered tell\nme again exactly how you saw the announcement of your wife\u2019s marriage.\u2019\nVernon cried out\n\u2018Must we go over it again and again It was all so horrible.",
    "I don\u2019t want to\nthink of it any more.\u2019\nAnd then the doctor explained gravely and kindly but very impressively.",
    "It\nwas because of that desire not to \u2018think of it any more\u2019 that all this had come\nabout.",
    "It must be faced now \u2013 thrashed out \u2026 Otherwise the loss of memory\nmight return.",
    "They went all over it again.",
    "And then when Vernon felt he could bear no more he was told to lie down\non a couch.",
    "The doctor touched his forehead and his limbs told him that he was\nresting \u2013 was rested \u2013 that he would become strong and happy again \u2026\nA feeling of peace came over Vernon.",
    "He closed his eyes \u2026\n\n4\nVernon came down to Abbots Puissants three days later.",
    "He came in Sebastian\nLevinne\u2019s car.",
    "To the butler he gave his name as Mr Green.",
    "Nell was waiting for\nhim in the little whitepanelled room where his mother had sat in the mornings.",
    "She came forward to meet him forcing a conventional smile to her lips.",
    "The\nbutler shut the door behind him just in time for her to stop short before offering\nhim her hand.",
    "They looked at each other.",
    "Then Vernon said\n\u2018Nell \u2026\u2019\nShe was in his arms.",
    "He kissed her \u2013 kissed her \u2013 kissed her \u2026\nHe let her go at last.",
    "They sat down.",
    "He was quiet rather tragic very\nrestrained but for that one wild greeting.",
    "He\u2019d gone through so much \u2013 so much\nin these last few days \u2026\n\n\fSometimes he wished they\u2019d left him alone \u2013 as George Green.",
    "It had been\njolly being George Green.",
    "He said stammeringly\n\u2018It\u2019s all right Nell.",
    "You mustn\u2019t think I blame you.",
    "I understand \u2026 Only it\nhurts.",
    "It hurts like Hell.",
    "Naturally.\u2019\nShe said \u2018I didn\u2019t mean \u2013\u2019\nHe interrupted her.",
    "\u2018I know I tell you \u2013 I know Don\u2019t talk about it.",
    "I don\u2019t want to hear about it.",
    "I don\u2019t want to think about it even \u2026\u2019 He added in a different tone \u2018They say\nthat\u2019s my trouble.",
    "That\u2019s how it happened.\u2019\nShe said rather eagerly \u2018Tell me about it \u2013 about everything.\u2019\n\u2018There isn\u2019t much to tell.\u2019 He spoke without interest abstractedly.",
    "\u2018I was\ntaken prisoner.",
    "How I got to be reported killed I don\u2019t know.",
    "At least I have a\nsort of vague idea.",
    "There was a fellow very like me \u2013 one of the Huns.",
    "I don\u2019t\nmean a double \u2013 or anything of that sort \u2013 but just a general superficial\nresemblance.",
    "My German\u2019s pretty rotten but I heard them commenting on it.",
    "They took my kit and my identification disc.",
    "I think the idea was to penetrate\ninto our lines as me \u2013 we were being relieved by Colonial troops \u2013 and they\nknew it.",
    "The fellow would pass muster for a day or so and would gain the\ninformation he wanted.",
    "That\u2019s only an idea \u2013 but it explains why I wasn\u2019t\nreturned in the list of prisoners and I was sent to a camp that was practically all\nFrench and Belgians.",
    "But none of that matters does it I suppose the Hun was\nkilled getting through our lines and was buried as me.",
    "I had a pretty bad time in\nGermany \u2013 nearly died with some kind of fever on top of being wounded.",
    "Finally I escaped \u2013 oh it\u2019s a long story.",
    "I\u2019m not going into all that now.",
    "I had the\nHell of a time \u2013 without food and water sometimes for days at a stretch.",
    "It was a\nsort of miracle that I came through \u2013 but I did.",
    "I got into Holland.",
    "I was\nexhausted and at the same time all strung up.",
    "And I could only think of one thing\n\u2013 getting back to you.\u2019\n\u2018Yes\u2019\n\u2018And then I saw it \u2013 in a beastly illustrated paper.",
    "Your marriage.",
    "It \u2013 it\nfinished me.",
    "But I wouldn\u2019t face it.",

    "Nothing matters \u2013 but you.\u2019\nShe smiled at him but her smile was flickering and uncertain.",
