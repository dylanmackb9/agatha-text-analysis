    "\fMurder in\nMesopotamia\nA Hercule Poirot Mystery\n\n\fDedication\n\nDedicated to\nMy many archaeological friends\nin Iraq and Syria\n\n\fForeword\nby Giles Reilly MD\n\nThe events chronicled in this narrative took place some four years ago.",
    "Circumstances have rendered it necessary in my opinion that a\nstraightforward account of them should be given to the public.",
    "There\nhave been the wildest and most ridiculous rumours suggesting that\nimportant evidence was suppressed and other nonsense of that kind.",
    "Those misconstructions have appeared more especially in the American\nPress.",
    "For obvious reasons it was desirable that the account should not\ncome from the pen of one of the expedition staff who might reasonably\nbe supposed to be prejudiced.",
    "I therefore suggested to Miss Amy Leatheran that she should\nundertake the task.",
    "She is obviously the person to do it.",
    "She had a\nprofessional character of the highest she is not biased by having any\nprevious connection with the University of Pittstown Expedition to Iraq\nand she was an observant and intellectual eyewitness.",
    "It was not very easy to persuade Miss Leatheran to undertake this\ntask\u2014in fact persuading her was one of the hardest jobs of my\nprofessional career\u2014and even after it was completed she displayed a\ncurious reluctance to let me see the manuscript.",
    "I discovered that this\nwas partly due to some critical remarks she had made concerning my\ndaughter Sheila.",
    "I soon disposed of that assuring her that as children\ncriticize their parents freely in print nowadays parents are only too\ndelighted when their offspring come in for their share of abuse Her\nother objection was extreme modesty about her literary style.",
    "She hoped\nI would \u201cput the grammar right and all that.\u201d I have on the contrary\nrefused to alter so much as a single word.",
    "Miss Leatheran\u2019s style in my\nopinion is vigorous individual and entirely apposite.",
    "If she calls Hercule\n\n\fPoirot \u201cPoirot\u201d in one paragraph and \u201cMr.",
    "Poirot\u201d in the next such a\nvariation is both interesting and suggestive.",
    "At one moment she is so to\nspeak \u201cremembering her manners\u201d and hospital nurses are great\nsticklers for etiquette and at the next her interest in what she is telling is\nthat of a pure human being\u2014cap and cuffs forgotten\nThe only thing I have done is to take the liberty of writing a first\nchapter\u2014aided by a letter kindly supplied by one of Miss Leatheran\u2019s\nfriends.",
    "It is intended to be in the nature of a frontispiece\u2014that is it\ngives a rough sketch of the narrator.",
    "One\nFRONTISPIECE\n\nIn the hall of the Tigris Palace Hotel in Baghdad a hospital nurse was\nfinishing a letter.",
    "Her fountain pen drove briskly over the paper.\n. . . Well dear I think that\u2019s really all my news.",
    "I must say it\u2019s been\nnice to see a bit of the world\u2014though England for me every time\nthank you.",
    "The dirt and the mess in Baghdad you wouldn\u2019t believe\u2014\nand not romantic at all like you\u2019d think from the Arabian Nights Of\ncourse it\u2019s pretty just on the river but the town itself is just awful\u2014\nand no proper shops at all.",
    "Major Kelsey took me through the\nbazaars and of course there\u2019s no denying they\u2019re quaint\u2014but just a\nlot of rubbish and hammering away at copper pans till they make\nyour headache\u2014and not what I\u2019d like to use myself unless I was sure\nabout the cleaning.",
    "You\u2019ve got to be so careful of verdigris with\ncopper pans.",
    "I\u2019ll write and let you know if anything comes of the job that\nDr. Reilly spoke about.",
    "He said this American gentleman was in\nBaghdad now and might come and see me this afternoon.",
    "It\u2019s for his\nwife\u2014she has \u201cfancies\u201d so Dr. Reilly said.",
    "He didn\u2019t say any more\nthan that and of course dear one knows what that usually means\nbut I hope not actually D.T.s.",
    "Of course Dr. Reilly didn\u2019t say\nanything\u2014but he had a look\u2014if you know what I mean.",
    "This\nDr. Leidner is an archaeologist and is digging up a mound out in the\ndesert somewhere for some American museum.",
    "Well dear I will close now.",
    "I thought what you told me about\nlittle Stubbins was simply killing Whatever did Matron say\n\n\fNo more now.",
    "Yours ever\nAmy Leatheran\nEnclosing the letter in an envelope she addressed it to Sister\nCurshaw St. Christopher\u2019s Hospital London.",
    "As she put the cap on her fountain pen one of the native boys\napproached her.",
    "\u201cA gentleman come to see you.",
    "Dr. Leidner.\u201d\nNurse Leatheran turned.",
    "She saw a man of middle height with\nslightly stooping shoulders a brown beard and gentle tired eyes.",
    "Dr. Leidner saw a woman of thirtyfive of erect confident bearing.",
    "He saw a goodhumoured face with slightly prominent blue eyes and\nglossy brown hair.",
    "She looked he thought just what a hospital nurse for\na nervous case ought to look.",
    "Cheerful robust shrewd and matteroffact.",
    "Nurse Leatheran he thought would do.",
    "Two\nINTRODUCING AMY LEATHERAN\n\nI don\u2019t pretend to be an author or to know anything about writing.",
    "I\u2019m\ndoing this simply because Dr. Reilly asked me to and somehow when\nDr. Reilly asks you to do a thing you don\u2019t like to refuse.",
    "\u201cOh but doctor\u201d I said \u201cI\u2019m not literary\u2014not literary at all.\u201d\n\u201cNonsense\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cTreat it as case notes if you like.\u201d\nWell of course you can look at it that way.",
    "Dr. Reilly went on.",
    "He said that an unvarnished plain account of the\nTell Yarimjah business was badly needed.",
    "\u201cIf one of the interested parties writes it it won\u2019t carry conviction.",
    "They\u2019ll say it\u2019s biased one way or another.\u201d\nAnd of course that was true too.",
    "I was in it all and yet an outsider\nso to speak.",
    "\u201cWhy don\u2019t you write it yourself doctor\u201d I asked.",
    "\u201cI wasn\u2019t on the spot\u2014you were.",
    "Besides\u201d he added with a sigh\n\u201cmy daughter won\u2019t let me.\u201d\nThe way he knuckles under to that chit of a girl of his is downright\ndisgraceful.",
    "I had half a mind to say so when I saw that his eyes were\ntwinkling.",
    "That was the worst of Dr. Reilly.",
    "You never knew whether he\nwas joking or not.",
    "He always said things in the same slow melancholy\nway\u2014but half the time there was a twinkle underneath it.",
    "\u201cWell\u201d I said doubtfully \u201cI suppose I could.\u201d\n\u201cOf course you could.\u201d\n\u201cOnly I don\u2019t quite know how to set about it.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s a good precedent for that.",
    "Begin at the beginning go on to\nthe end and then leave off.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cI don\u2019t even know quite where and what the beginning was\u201d I said\ndoubtfully.",
    "\u201cBelieve me nurse the difficulty of beginning will be nothing to the\ndifficulty of knowing how to stop.",
    "At least that\u2019s the way it is with me\nwhen I have to make a speech.",
    "Someone\u2019s got to catch hold of my\ncoattails and pull me down by main force.\u201d\n\u201cOh you\u2019re joking doctor.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s profoundly serious I am.",
    "Now what about it\u201d\nAnother thing was worrying me.",
    "After hesitating a moment or two I\nsaid \u201cYou know doctor I\u2019m afraid I might tend to be\u2014well a little\npersonal sometimes.\u201d\n\u201cGod bless my soul woman the more personal you are the better\nThis is a story of human beings\u2014not dummies Be personal\u2014be\nprejudiced\u2014be catty\u2014be anything you please Write the thing your own\nway.",
    "We can always prune out the bits that are libellous afterwards You\ngo ahead.",
    "You\u2019re a sensible woman and you\u2019ll give a sensible\ncommonsense account of the business.\u201d\nSo that was that and I promised to do my best.",
    "And here I am beginning but as I said to the doctor it\u2019s difficult to\nknow just where to start.",
    "I suppose I ought to say a word or two about myself.",
    "I\u2019m thirtytwo\nand my name is Amy Leatheran.",
    "I took my training at St. Christopher\u2019s\nand after that did two years maternity.",
    "I did a certain amount of private\nwork and I was for four years at Miss Bendix\u2019s Nursing Home in\nDevonshire Place.",
    "I came out to Iraq with a Mrs. Kelsey.",
    "I\u2019d attended her\nwhen her baby was born.",
    "She was coming out to Baghdad with her\nhusband and had already got a children\u2019s nurse booked who had been for\nsome years with friends of hers out there.",
    "Their children were coming\nhome and going to school and the nurse had agreed to go to Mrs. Kelsey\nwhen they left.",
    "Mrs. Kelsey was delicate and nervous about the journey\nout with so young a child so Major Kelsey arranged that I should come\nout with her and look after her and the baby.",
    "They would pay my passage\nhome unless we found someone needing a nurse for the return journey.",
    "Well there is no need to describe the Kelseys\u2014the baby was a little\nlove and Mrs. Kelsey quite nice though rather the fretting kind.",
    "I\n\n\fenjoyed the voyage very much.",
    "I\u2019d never been a long trip on the sea\nbefore.",
    "Dr. Reilly was on board the boat.",
    "He was a blackhaired longfaced\nman who said all sorts of funny things in a low sad voice.",
    "I think he\nenjoyed pulling my leg and used to make the most extraordinary\nstatements to see if I would swallow them.",
    "He was the civil surgeon at a\nplace called Hassanieh\u2014a day and a half \u2019s journey from Baghdad.",
    "I had been about a week in Baghdad when I ran across him and he\nasked when I was leaving the Kelseys.",
    "I said that it was funny his asking\nthat because as a matter of fact the Wrights the other people I\nmentioned were going home earlier than they had meant to and their\nnurse was free to come straightaway.",
    "He said that he had heard about the Wrights and that that was why he\nhad asked me.",
    "\u201cAs a matter of fact nurse I\u2019ve got a possible job for you.\u201d\n\u201cA case\u201d\nHe screwed his face up as though considering.",
    "\u201cYou could hardly call it a case.",
    "It\u2019s just a lady who has\u2014shall we\nsay\u2014fancies\u201d\n\u201cOh\u201d I said.",
    "One usually knows what that means\u2014drink or drugs\nDr. Reilly didn\u2019t explain further.",
    "He was very discreet.",
    "\u201cYes\u201d he\nsaid.",
    "\u201cA Mrs. Leidner.",
    "Husband\u2019s an American\u2014an American Swede to\nbe exact.",
    "He\u2019s the head of a large American dig.\u201d\nAnd he explained how this expedition was excavating the site of a\nbig Assyrian city something like Nineveh.",
    "The expedition house was not\nactually very far from Hassanieh but it was a lonely spot and\nDr. Leidner had been worried for some time about his wife\u2019s health.",
    "\u201cHe\u2019s not been very explicit about it but it seems she has these fits\nof recurring nervous terrors.\u201d\n\u201cIs she left alone all day amongst natives\u201d I asked.",
    "\u201cOh no there\u2019s quite a crowd\u2014seven or eight.",
    "I don\u2019t fancy she\u2019s\never been alone in the house.",
    "But there seems to be no doubt that she\u2019s\nworked herself up into a queer state.",
    "Leidner has any amount of work on\nhis shoulders but he\u2019s crazy about his wife and it worries him to know\n\n\fshe\u2019s in this state.",
    "He felt he\u2019d be happier if he knew that some\nresponsible person with expert knowledge was keeping an eye on her.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what does Mrs. Leidner herself think about it\u201d\nDr. Reilly answered gravely\n\u201cMrs.",
    "Leidner is a very lovely lady.",
    "She\u2019s seldom of the same mind\nabout anything two days on end.",
    "But on the whole she favours the idea.\u201d\nHe added \u201cShe\u2019s an odd woman.",
    "A mass of affection and I should\nfancy a champion liar\u2014but Leidner seems honestly to believe that she is\nscared out of her life by something or other.\u201d\n\u201cWhat did she herself say to you doctor\u201d\n\u201cOh she hasn\u2019t consulted me She doesn\u2019t like me anyway\u2014for\nseveral reasons.",
    "It was Leidner who came to me and propounded this\nplan.",
    "Well nurse what do you think of the idea You\u2019d see something of\nthe country before you go home\u2014they\u2019ll be digging for another two\nmonths.",
    "And excavation is quite interesting work.\u201d\nAfter a moment\u2019s hesitation while I turned the matter over in my\nmind \u201cWell\u201d I said \u201cI really think I might try it.\u201d\n\u201cSplendid\u201d said Dr. Reilly rising.",
    "\u201cLeidner\u2019s in Baghdad now.",
    "I\u2019ll\ntell him to come round and see if he can fix things up with you.\u201d\nDr. Leidner came to the hotel that afternoon.",
    "He was a middleaged\nman with a rather nervous hesitating manner.",
    "There was something\ngentle and kindly and rather helpless about him.",
    "He sounded very devoted to his wife but he was very vague about\nwhat was the matter with her.",
    "\u201cYou see\u201d he said tugging at his beard in a rather perplexed manner\nthat I later came to know to be characteristic of him \u201cmy wife is really in\na very nervous state.",
    "I\u2014I\u2019m quite worried about her.\u201d\n\u201cShe is in good physical health\u201d I asked.",
    "\u201cYes\u2014oh yes I think so.",
    "No I should not think there was anything\nthe matter with her physically.",
    "But she\u2014well\u2014imagines things you\nknow.\u201d\n\u201cWhat kind of things\u201d I asked.",
    "But he shied off from the point merely murmuring perplexedly\n\u201cShe works herself up over nothing at all .",
    ". .",
    "I really can see no\nfoundations for these fears.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cFears of what Dr. Leidner\u201d\nHe said vaguely \u201cOh just\u2014nervous terrors you know.\u201d\nTen to one I thought to myself it\u2019s drugs.",
    "And he doesn\u2019t realize it\nLots of men don\u2019t.",
    "Just wonder why their wives are so jumpy and have\nsuch extraordinary changes of mood.",
    "I asked whether Mrs. Leidner herself approved of the idea of my\ncoming.",
    "His face lighted up.",
    "\u201cYes.",
    "I was surprised.",
    "Most pleasurably surprised.",
    "She said it was a\nvery good idea.",
    "She said she would feel very much safer.\u201d\nThe word struck me oddly.",
    "Safer.",
    "A very queer word to use.",
    "I began\nto surmise that Mrs. Leidner might be a mental case.",
    "He went on with a kind of boyish eagerness.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll get on very well with her.",
    "She\u2019s really a very\ncharming woman.\u201d He smiled disarmingly.",
    "\u201cShe feels you\u2019ll be the\ngreatest comfort to her.",
    "I felt the same as soon as I saw you.",
    "You look if\nyou will allow me to say so so splendidly healthy and full of common\nsense.",
    "I\u2019m sure you\u2019re just the person for Louise.\u201d\n\u201cWell we can but try Dr. Leidner\u201d I said cheerfully.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m sure I\nhope I can be of use to your wife.",
    "Perhaps she\u2019s nervous of natives and\ncoloured people\u201d\n\u201cOh dear me no.\u201d He shook his head amused at the idea.",
    "\u201cMy wife\nlikes Arabs very much\u2014she appreciates their simplicity and their sense\nof humour.",
    "This is only her second season\u2014we have been married less\nthan two years\u2014but she already speaks quite a fair amount of Arabic.\u201d\nI was silent for a moment or two then I had one more try.",
    "\u201cCan\u2019t you tell me at all what it is your wife is afraid of\nDr. Leidner\u201d I asked.",
    "He hesitated.",
    "Then he said slowly \u201cI hope\u2014I believe\u2014that she will\ntell you that herself.\u201d\nAnd that\u2019s all I could get out of him.",
    "Three\nGOSSIP\n\nIt was arranged that I should go to Tell Yarimjah the following week.",
    "Mrs. Kelsey was settling into her house at Alwiyah and I was glad\nto be able to take a few things off her shoulders.",
    "During that time I heard one or two allusions to the Leidner\nexpedition.",
    "A friend of Mrs. Kelsey\u2019s a young squadron leader pursed\nhis lips in surprise as he exclaimed \u201cLovely Louise.",
    "So that\u2019s her latest\u201d\nHe turned to me.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s our nickname for her nurse.",
    "She\u2019s always\nknown as Lovely Louise.\u201d\n\u201cIs she so very handsome then\u201d I asked.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s taking her at her own valuation.",
    "She thinks she is\u201d\n\u201cNow don\u2019t be spiteful John\u201d said Mrs. Kelsey.",
    "\u201cYou know it\u2019s not\nonly she who thinks so Lots of people have been very smitten by her.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps you\u2019re right.",
    "She\u2019s a bit long in the tooth but she has a\ncertain attraction.\u201d\n\u201cYou were completely bowled over yourself\u201d said Mrs. Kelsey\nlaughing.",
    "The squadron leader blushed and admitted rather shamefacedly\n\u201cWell she has a way with her.",
    "As for Leidner himself he worships the\nground she walks on\u2014and all the rest of the expedition has to worship\ntoo It\u2019s expected of them\u201d\n\u201cHow many are there altogether\u201d I asked.",
    "\u201cAll sorts and nationalities nurse\u201d said the squadronleader\ncheerfully.",
    "\u201cAn English architect a French Father from Carthage\u2014he\ndoes the inscriptions\u2014tablets and things you know.",
    "And then there\u2019s\nMiss Johnson.",
    "She\u2019s English too\u2014sort of general bottlewasher.",
    "And a\nlittle plump man who does the photography\u2014he\u2019s an American.",
    "And the\n\n\fMercados.",
    "Heaven knows what nationality they are\u2014Dagos of some\nkind She\u2019s quite young\u2014a snakylooking creature\u2014and oh doesn\u2019t she\nhate Lovely Louise And there are a couple of youngsters and that\u2019s the\nlot.",
    "A few odd fish but nice on the whole\u2014don\u2019t you agree\nPennyman\u201d\nHe was appealing to an elderly man who was sitting thoughtfully\ntwirling a pair of pincenez.",
    "The latter started and looked up.",
    "\u201cYes\u2014yes\u2014very nice indeed.",
    "Taken individually that is.",
    "Of course\nMercado is rather a queer fish\u2014\u201d\n\u201cHe has such a very odd beard\u201d put in Mrs. Kelsey.",
    "\u201cA queer limp\nkind.\u201d\nMajor Pennyman went on without noticing her interruption.",
    "\u201cThe young \u2019uns are both nice.",
    "The American\u2019s rather silent and the\nEnglish boy talks a bit too much.",
    "Funny it\u2019s usually the other way round.",
    "Leidner himself is a delightful fellow\u2014so modest and unassuming.",
    "Yes\nindividually they are all pleasant people.",
    "But somehow or other I may\nhave been fanciful but the last time I went to see them I got a queer\nimpression of something being wrong.",
    "I don\u2019t know what it was exactly\n.",
    ". . Nobody seemed quite natural.",
    "There was a queer atmosphere of\ntension.",
    "I can explain best what I mean by saying that they all passed the\nbutter to each other too politely.\u201d\nBlushing a little because I don\u2019t like airing my own opinions too\nmuch I said \u201cIf people are too much cooped up together it\u2019s got a way\nof getting on their nerves.",
    "I know that myself from experience in\nhospital.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s true\u201d said Major Kelsey \u201cbut it\u2019s early in the season hardly\ntime for that particular irritation to have set in.\u201d\n\u201cAn expedition is probably like our life here in miniature\u201d said\nMajor Pennyman.",
    "\u201cIt has its cliques and rivalries and jealousies.\u201d\n\u201cIt sounds as though they\u2019d got a good many newcomers this year\u201d\nsaid Major Kelsey.",
    "\u201cLet me see.\u201d The squadron leader counted them off on his fingers.",
    "\u201cYoung Coleman is new so is Reiter.",
    "Emmott was out last year and so\nwere the Mercados.",
    "Father Lavigny is a newcomer.",
    "He\u2019s come in place\n\n\fof Dr. Byrd who was ill this year and couldn\u2019t come out.",
    "Carey of\ncourse is an old hand.",
    "He\u2019s been out ever since the beginning five years\nago.",
    "Miss Johnson\u2019s been out nearly as many years as Carey.\u201d\n\u201cI always thought they got on so well together at Tell Yarimjah\u201d\nremarked Major Kelsey.",
    "\u201cThey seemed like a happy family\u2014which is\nreally surprising when one considers what human nature is I\u2019m sure\nNurse Leatheran agrees with me.\u201d\n\u201cWell\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t know that you\u2019re not right The rows I\u2019ve\nknown in hospital and starting often from nothing more than a dispute\nabout a pot of tea.\u201d\n\u201cYes one tends to get petty in close communities\u201d said Major\nPennyman.",
    "\u201cAll the same I feel there must be something more to it in\nthis case.",
    "Leidner is such a gentle unassuming man with really a\nremarkable amount of tact.",
    "He\u2019s always managed to keep his expedition\nhappy and on good terms with each other.",
    "And yet I did notice that\nfeeling of tension the other day.\u201d\nMrs. Kelsey laughed.",
    "\u201cAnd you don\u2019t see the explanation Why it leaps to the eye\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean\u201d\n\u201cMrs.",
    "Leidner of course.\u201d\n\u201cOh come Mary\u201d said her husband \u201cshe\u2019s a charming woman\u2014not\nat all the quarrelsome kind.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t say she was quarrelsome.",
    "She causes quarrels\u201d\n\u201cIn what way And why should she\u201d\n\u201cWhy Why Because she\u2019s bored.",
    "She\u2019s not an archaeologist only\nthe wife of one.",
    "She\u2019s bored shut away from any excitements and so she\nprovides her own drama.",

    "You\u2019re merely imagining.\u201d\n\u201cOf course I\u2019m imagining But you\u2019ll find I\u2019m right.",
    "Lovely Louise\ndoesn\u2019t look like the Mona Lisa for nothing She mayn\u2019t mean any harm\nbut she likes to see what will happen.\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s devoted to Leidner.\u201d\n\u201cOh I dare say I\u2019m not suggesting vulgar intrigues.",
    "But she\u2019s an\nallumeuse that woman.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cWomen are so sweet to each other\u201d said Major Kelsey.",
    "\u201cI know.",
    "Cat cat cat that\u2019s what you men say.",
    "But we\u2019re usually\nright about our own sex.\u201d\n\u201cAll the same\u201d said Major Pennyman thoughtfully \u201cassuming all\nMrs. Kelsey\u2019s uncharitable surmises to be true I don\u2019t think it would\nquite account for that curious sense of tension\u2014rather like the feeling\nthere is before a thunderstorm.",
    "I had the impression very strongly that\nthe storm might break any minute.\u201d\n\u201cNow don\u2019t frighten nurse\u201d said Mrs. Kelsey.",
    "\u201cShe\u2019s going there in\nthree days\u2019 time and you\u2019ll put her right off.\u201d\n\u201cOh you won\u2019t frighten me\u201d I said laughing.",
    "All the same I thought a good deal about what had been said.",
    "Dr. Leidner\u2019s curious use of the word \u201csafer\u201d recurred to me.",
    "Was it his\nwife\u2019s secret fear unacknowledged or expressed perhaps that was\nreacting on the rest of the party Or was it the actual tension or perhaps\nthe unknown cause of it that was reacting on her nerves\nI looked up the word allumeuse that Mrs. Kelsey had used in a\ndictionary but couldn\u2019t get any sense out of it.",
    "\u201cWell\u201d I thought to myself \u201cI must wait and see.\u201d\n\n\fFour\nI ARRIVE IN HASSANIEH\n\nThree days later I left Baghdad.",
    "I was sorry to leave Mrs. Kelsey and the baby who was a little love\nand was thriving splendidly gaining her proper number of ounces every\nweek.",
    "Major Kelsey took me to the station and saw me off.",
    "I should\narrive at Kirkuk the following morning and there someone was to meet\nme.",
    "I slept badly I never sleep very well in a train and I was troubled by\ndreams.",
    "The next morning however when I looked out of the window it\nwas a lovely day and I felt interested and curious about the people I was\ngoing to see.",
    "As I stood on the platform hesitating and looking about me I saw a\nyoung man coming towards me.",
    "He had a round pink face and really in\nall my life I have never seen anyone who seemed so exactly like a young\nman out of one of Mr. P. G. Wodehouse\u2019s books.",
    "\u201cHallo \u2019allo \u2019allo\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cAre you Nurse Leatheran Well I mean\nyou must be\u2014I can see that.",
    "Ha ha My name\u2019s Coleman.",
    "Dr. Leidner\nsent me along.",
    "How are you feeling Beastly journey and all that Don\u2019t I\nknow these trains Well here we are\u2014had any breakfast This your kit I\nsay awfully modest aren\u2019t you Mrs. Leidner has four suitcases and a\ntrunk\u2014to say nothing of a hatbox and a patent pillow and this that and\nthe other.",
    "Am I talking too much Come along to the old bus.\u201d\nThere was what I heard called later a station wagon waiting outside.",
    "It was a little like a wagonette a little like a lorry and a little like a car.",
    "Mr. Coleman helped me in explaining that I had better sit next to the\ndriver so as to get less jolting.",
    "Jolting I wonder the whole contraption didn\u2019t fall to pieces And\nnothing like a road\u2014just a sort of track all ruts and holes.",
    "Glorious East\nindeed When I thought of our splendid arterial roads in England it made\nme quite homesick.",
    "Mr. Coleman leaned forward from his seat behind me and yelled in\nmy ear a good deal.",
    "\u201cTrack\u2019s in pretty good condition\u201d he shouted just after we had been\nthrown up in our seats till we nearly touched the roof.",
    "And apparently he was speaking quite seriously.",
    "\u201cVery good for you\u2014jogs the liver\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cYou ought to know\nthat nurse.\u201d\n\u201cA stimulated liver won\u2019t be much good to me if my head\u2019s split\nopen\u201d I observed tartly.",
    "\u201cYou should come along here after it\u2019s rained The skids are glorious.",
    "Most of the time one\u2019s going sideways.\u201d\nTo this I did not respond.",
    "Presently we had to cross the river which we did on the craziest\nferryboat you can imagine.",
    "It was a mercy we ever got across but\neveryone seemed to think it was quite usual.",
    "It took us about four hours to get to Hassanieh which to my surprise\nwas quite a big place.",
    "Very pretty it looked too before we got there from\nthe other side of the river\u2014standing up quite white and fairylike with\nminarets.",
    "It was a bit different though when one had crossed the bridge\nand come right into it.",
    "Such a smell and everything ramshackle and\ntumbledown and mud and mess everywhere.",
    "Mr. Coleman took me to Dr. Reilly\u2019s house where he said the\ndoctor was expecting me to lunch.",
    "Dr. Reilly was just as nice as ever and his house was nice too with a\nbathroom and everything spick and span.",
    "I had a nice bath and by the\ntime I got back into my uniform and came down I was feeling fine.",
    "Lunch was just ready and we went in the doctor apologizing for his\ndaughter who he said was always late.",
    "We\u2019d just had a very good dish of\neggs in sauce when she came in and Dr. Reilly said \u201cNurse this is my\ndaughter Sheila.\u201d\nShe shook hands hoped I\u2019d had a good journey tossed off her hat\ngave a cool nod to Mr. Coleman and sat down.",
    "\u201cWell Bill\u201d she said.",
    "\u201cHow\u2019s everything\u201d\nHe began to talk to her about some party or other that was to come\noff at the club and I took stock of her.",
    "I can\u2019t say I took to her much.",
    "A thought too cool for my liking.",
    "An\noffhand sort of girl though goodlooking.",
    "Black hair and blue eyes\u2014a\npale sort of face and the usual lipsticked mouth.",
    "She\u2019d a cool sarcastic\nway of talking that rather annoyed me.",
    "I had a probationer like her under\nme once\u2014a girl who worked well I\u2019ll admit but whose manner always\nriled me.",
    "It looked to me rather as though Mr. Coleman was gone on her.",
    "He\nstammered a bit and his conversation became slightly more idiotic than it\nwas before if that was possible He reminded me of a large stupid dog\nwagging its tail and trying to please.",
    "After lunch Dr. Reilly went off to the hospital and Mr. Coleman had\nsome things to get in the town and Miss Reilly asked me whether I\u2019d like\nto see round the town a bit or whether I\u2019d rather stop in the house.",
    "Mr. Coleman she said would be back to fetch me in about an hour.",
    "\u201cIs there anything to see\u201d I asked.",
    "\u201cThere are some picturesque corners\u201d said Miss Reilly.",
    "\u201cBut I don\u2019t\nknow that you\u2019d care for them.",
    "They\u2019re extremely dirty.\u201d\nThe way she said it rather nettled me.",
    "I\u2019ve never been able to see that\npicturesqueness excuses dirt.",
    "In the end she took me to the club which was pleasant enough\noverlooking the river and there were English papers and magazines there.",
    "When we got back to the house Mr. Coleman wasn\u2019t there yet so we\nsat down and talked a bit.",
    "It wasn\u2019t easy somehow.",
    "She asked me if I\u2019d met Mrs. Leidner yet.",
    "\u201cNo\u201d I said.",
    "\u201cOnly her husband.\u201d\n\u201cOh\u201d she said.",
    "\u201cI wonder what you\u2019ll think of her\u201d\nI didn\u2019t say anything to that.",
    "And she went on \u201cI like Dr. Leidner\nvery much.",
    "Everybody likes him.\u201d\nThat\u2019s as good as saying I thought that you don\u2019t like his wife.",
    "I still didn\u2019t say anything and presently she asked abruptly \u201cWhat\u2019s\nthe matter with her Did Dr. Leidner tell you\u201d\nI wasn\u2019t going to start gossiping about a patient before I got there\neven so I said evasively \u201cI understand she\u2019s a bit rundown and wants\n\n\flooking after.\u201d\nShe laughed\u2014a nasty sort of laugh\u2014hard and abrupt.",
    "\u201cGood God\u201d she said.",
    "\u201cAren\u2019t nine people looking after her already\nenough\u201d\n\u201cI suppose they\u2019ve all got their work to do\u201d I said.",
    "\u201cWork to do Of course they\u2019ve got work to do.",
    "But Louise comes\nfirst\u2014she sees to that all right.\u201d\n\u201cNo\u201d I said to myself.",
    "\u201cYou don\u2019t like her.\u201d\n\u201cAll the same\u201d went on Miss Reilly \u201cI don\u2019t see what she wants\nwith a professional hospital nurse.",
    "I should have thought amateur\nassistance was more in her line not someone who\u2019ll jam a thermometer\nin her mouth and count her pulse and bring everything down to hard\nfacts.\u201d\nWell I must admit it I was curious.",
    "\u201cYou think there\u2019s nothing the matter with her\u201d I asked.",
    "\u201cOf course there\u2019s nothing the matter with her The woman\u2019s as\nstrong as an ox.",
    "\u2018Dear Louise hasn\u2019t slept.\u2019 \u2018She\u2019s got black circles under\nher eyes.\u2019 Yes\u2014put there with a blue pencil Anything to get attention to\nhave everybody hovering round her making a fuss of her\u201d\nThere was something in that of course.",
    "I had what nurse hasn\u2019t\ncome across many cases of hypochondriacs whose delight it is to keep a\nwhole household dancing attendance.",
    "And if a doctor or a nurse were to\nsay to them \u201cThere\u2019s nothing on earth the matter with you\u201d Well to\nbegin with they wouldn\u2019t believe it and their indignation would be as\ngenuine as indignation can be.",
    "Of course it was quite possible that Mrs. Leidner might be a case of\nthis kind.",
    "The husband naturally would be the first to be deceived.",
    "Husbands I\u2019ve found are a credulous lot where illness is concerned.",
    "But\nall the same it didn\u2019t quite square with what I\u2019d heard.",
    "It didn\u2019t for\ninstance fit in with that word \u201csafer.\u201d\nFunny how that word had got kind of stuck in my mind.",
    "Reflecting on it I asked \u201cIs Mrs. Leidner a nervous woman Is she\nnervous for instance of living out far from anywhere\u201d\n\u201cWhat is there to be nervous of Good heavens there are ten of\nthem And they\u2019ve got guards too\u2014because of the antiquities.",
    "Oh no\nshe\u2019s not nervous\u2014at least\u2014\u201d\n\n\fShe seemed struck by some thought and stopped\u2014going on slowly\nafter a minute or two.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s odd your saying that.\u201d\n\u201cWhy\u201d\n\u201cFlight Lieutenant Jervis and I rode over the other day.",
    "It was in the\nmorning.",
    "Most of them were up on the dig.",
    "She was sitting writing a letter\nand I suppose she didn\u2019t hear us coming.",
    "The boy who brings you in\nwasn\u2019t about for once and we came straight up on to the verandah.",
    "Apparently she saw Flight Lieutenant Jervis\u2019s shadow thrown on the wall\n\u2014and she fairly screamed Apologized of course.",
    "Said she thought it\nwas a strange man.",
    "A bit odd that.",
    "I mean even if it was a strange man\nwhy get the wind up\u201d\nI nodded thoughtfully.",
    "Miss Reilly was silent then burst out suddenly\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s the matter with them this year.",
    "They\u2019ve all got\nthe jumps.",
    "Johnson goes about so glum she can\u2019t open her mouth.",
    "David\nnever speaks if he can help it.",
    "Bill of course never stops and somehow\nhis chatter seems to make the others worse.",
    "Carey goes about looking as\nthough something would snap any minute.",
    "And they all watch each other\nas though\u2014as though\u2014Oh I don\u2019t know but it\u2019s queer.\u201d\nIt was odd I thought that two such dissimilar people as Miss Reilly\nand Major Pennyman should have been struck in the same manner.",
    "Just then Mr. Coleman came bustling in.",
    "Bustling was just the word\nfor it.",
    "If his tongue had hung out and he had suddenly produced a tail to\nwag you wouldn\u2019t have been surprised.",
    "\u201cHalloallo\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cAbsolutely the world\u2019s best shopper\u2014that\u2019s\nme.",
    "Have you shown nurse all the beauties of the town\u201d\n\u201cShe wasn\u2019t impressed\u201d said Miss Reilly dryly.",
    "\u201cI don\u2019t blame her\u201d said Mr. Coleman heartily.",
    "\u201cOf all the onehorse\ntumbledown places\u201d\n\u201cNot a lover of the picturesque or the antique are you Bill I can\u2019t\nthink why you are an archaeologist.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t blame me for that.",
    "Blame my guardian.",
    "He\u2019s a learned bird\u2014\nfellow of his college\u2014browses among books in bedroom slippers\u2014that\nkind of man.",
    "Bit of a shock for him to have a ward like me.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cI think it\u2019s frightfully stupid of you to be forced into a profession\nyou don\u2019t care for\u201d said the girl sharply.",
    "\u201cNot forced Sheila old girl not forced.",
    "The old man asked if I had\nany special profession in mind and I said I hadn\u2019t and so he wangled a\nseason out here for me.\u201d\n\u201cBut haven\u2019t you any idea really what you\u2019d like to do You must\nhave\u201d\n\u201cOf course I have.",
    "My idea would be to give work a miss altogether.",
    "What I\u2019d like to do is to have plenty of money and go in for motor\nracing.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re absurd\u201d said Miss Reilly.",
    "She sounded quite angry.",
    "\u201cOh I realize that it\u2019s quite out of the question\u201d said Mr. Coleman\ncheerfully.",
    "\u201cSo if I\u2019ve got to do something I don\u2019t much care what it is\nso long as it isn\u2019t mugging in an office all day long.",

    "Imitating handwriting used to be my speciality at school.",
    "I\u2019d have made a\nfirstclass forger.",
    "Oh well I may come to that yet.",
    "If my RollsRoyce\nsplashes you with mud as you\u2019re waiting for a bus you\u2019ll know that I\u2019ve\ntaken to crime.\u201d\nMiss Reilly said coldly \u201cDon\u2019t you think it\u2019s about time you started\ninstead of talking so much\u201d\n\u201cHospitable aren\u2019t we nurse\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure Nurse Leatheran is anxious to get settled in.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re always sure of everything\u201d retorted Mr. Coleman with a\ngrin.",
    "That was true enough I thought.",
    "Cocksure little minx.",
    "I said dryly \u201cPerhaps we\u2019d better start Mr. Coleman.\u201d\n\u201cRight you are nurse.\u201d\nI shook hands with Miss Reilly and thanked her and we set off.",
    "\u201cDamned attractive girl Sheila\u201d said Mr. Coleman.",
    "\u201cBut always\nticking a fellow off.\u201d\n\n\fWe drove out of the town and presently took a kind of track between\ngreen crops.",
    "It was very bumpy and full of ruts.",
    "After about half an hour Mr. Coleman pointed to a big mound by the\nriver bank ahead of us and said \u201cTell Yarimjah.\u201d\nI could see little black figures moving about it like ants.",
    "As I was looking they suddenly began to run all together down the\nside of the mound.",
    "\u201cFidos\u201d said Mr. Coleman.",
    "\u201cKnockingoff time.",
    "We knock off an\nhour before sunset.\u201d\nThe expedition house lay a little way back from the river.",
    "The driver rounded a corner bumped through an extremely narrow\narch and there we were.",
    "The house was built round a courtyard.",
    "Originally it had occupied\nonly the south side of the courtyard with a few unimportant outbuildings\non the east.",
    "The expedition had continued the building on the other two\nsides.",
    "As the plan of the house was to prove of special interest later I\nappend a rough sketch of it here.",
    "All the rooms opened on to the courtyard and most of the windows\n\u2014the exception being in the original south building where there were\nwindows giving on the outside country as well.",
    "These windows however\nwere barred on the outside.",
    "In the southwest corner a staircase ran up to a\nlong flat roof with a parapet running the length of the south side of the\nbuilding which was higher than the other three sides.",
    "Mr. Coleman led me along the east side of the courtyard and round to\nwhere a big open verandah occupied the centre of the south side.",
    "He\npushed open a door at one side of it and we entered a room where several\npeople were sitting round a tea table.",
    "\u201cToodleoodleoo\u201d said Mr. Coleman.",
    "\u201cHere\u2019s Sairey Gamp.\u201d\nThe lady who was sitting at the head of the table rose and came to\ngreet me.",
    "I had my first glimpse of Louise Leidner.",
    "Five\nTELL YARIMJAH\n\nI don\u2019t mind admitting that my first impression on seeing Mrs. Leidner\nwas one of downright surprise.",
    "One gets into the way of imagining a\nperson when one hears them talked about.",
    "I\u2019d got it firmly into my head\nthat Mrs. Leidner was a dark discontented kind of woman.",
    "The nervy\nkind all on edge.",
    "And then too I\u2019d expected her to be\u2014well to put it\nfrankly\u2014a bit vulgar.",
    "She wasn\u2019t a bit like what I\u2019d imagined her To begin with she was\nvery fair.",
    "She wasn\u2019t a Swede like her husband but she might have been\nas far as looks went.",
    "She had that blonde Scandinavian fairness that you\ndon\u2019t very often see.",
    "She wasn\u2019t a young woman.",
    "Midway between thirty\nand forty I should say.",
    "Her face was rather haggard and there was some\ngrey hair mingled with the fairness.",
    "Her eyes though were lovely.",
    "They\nwere the only eyes I\u2019ve ever come across that you might truly describe as\nviolet.",
    "They were very large and there were faint shadows underneath\nthem.",
    "She was very thin and fragilelooking and if I say that she had an\nair of intense weariness and was at the same time very much alive it\nsounds like nonsense\u2014but that\u2019s the feeling I got.",
    "I felt too that she was\na lady through and through.",
    "And that means something\u2014even\nnowadays.",
    "She put out her hand and smiled.",
    "Her voice was low and soft with an\nAmerican drawl in it.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m so glad you\u2019ve come nurse.",
    "Will you have some tea Or would\nyou like to go to your room first\u201d\nI said I\u2019d have tea and she introduced me to the people sitting round\nthe table.",
    "\u201cThis is Miss Johnson\u2014and Mr. Reiter.",
    "Mrs. Mercado.",
    "Mr. Emmott.",
    "Father Lavigny.",
    "My husband will be in presently.",
    "Sit down here between\nFather Lavigny and Miss Johnson.\u201d\nI did as I was bid and Miss Johnson began talking to me asking\nabout my journey and so on.",
    "I liked her.",
    "She reminded me of a matron I\u2019d had in my probationer\ndays whom we had all admired and worked hard for.",
    "She was getting on for fifty I should judge and rather mannish in\nappearance with irongrey hair cropped short.",
    "She had an abrupt\npleasant voice rather deep in tone.",
    "She had an ugly rugged face with an\nalmost laughably turnedup nose which she was in the habit of rubbing\nirritably when anything troubled or perplexed her.",
    "She wore a tweed coat\nand skirt made rather like a man\u2019s.",
    "She told me presently that she was a\nnative of Yorkshire.",
    "Father Lavigny I found just a bit alarming.",
    "He was a tall man with a\ngreat black beard and pincenez.",
    "I had heard Mrs. Kelsey say that there\nwas a French monk there and I now saw that Father Lavigny was\nwearing a monk\u2019s robe of some white woollen material.",
    "It surprised me\nrather because I always understood that monks went into monasteries\nand didn\u2019t come out again.",
    "Mrs. Leidner talked to him mostly in French but he spoke to me in\nquite fair English.",
    "I noticed that he had shrewd observant eyes which\ndarted about from face to face.",
    "Opposite me were the other three.",
    "Mr. Reiter was a stout fair young\nman with glasses.",
    "His hair was rather long and curly and he had very\nround blue eyes.",
    "I should think he must have been a lovely baby but he\nwasn\u2019t much to look at now In fact he was just a little like a pig.",
    "The\nother young man had very short hair cropped close to his head.",
    "He had a\nlong rather humorous face and very good teeth and he looked very\nattractive when he smiled.",
    "He said very little though just nodded if\nspoken to or answered in monosyllables.",
    "He like Mr. Reiter was an\nAmerican.",
    "The last person was Mrs. Mercado and I couldn\u2019t have a\ngood look at her because whenever I glanced in her direction I always\nfound her staring at me with a kind of hungry stare that was a bit\ndisconcerting to say the least of it.",
    "You might have thought a hospital\n\n\fnurse was a strange animal the way she was looking at me.",
    "No manners\nat all\nShe was quite young\u2014not more than about twentyfive\u2014and sort of\ndark and slinkylooking if you know what I mean.",
    "Quite nicelooking in\na kind of way but rather as though she might have what my mother used\nto call \u201ca touch of the tarbrush.\u201d She had on a very vivid pullover and\nher nails matched it in colour.",
    "She had a thin birdlike eager face with\nbig eyes and rather a tight suspicious mouth.",
    "The tea was very good\u2014a nice strong blend\u2014not like the weak\nChina stuff that Mrs. Kelsey always had and that had been a sore trial to\nme.",
    "There was toast and jam and a plate of rock buns and a cutting cake.",
    "Mr. Emmott was very polite passing me things.",
    "Quiet as he was he\nalways seemed to notice when my plate was empty.",
    "Presently Mr. Coleman bustled in and took the place beyond\nMiss Johnson.",
    "There didn\u2019t seem to be anything the matter with his\nnerves.",
    "He talked away nineteen to the dozen.",
    "Mrs. Leidner sighed once and cast a wearied look in his direction but\nit didn\u2019t have any effect.",
    "Nor did the fact that Mrs. Mercado to whom he\nwas addressing most of his conversation was far too busy watching me\nto do more than make perfunctory replies.",
    "Just as we were finishing Dr. Leidner and Mr. Mercado came in\nfrom the dig.",
    "Dr. Leidner greeted me in his nice kind manner.",
    "I saw his eyes go\nquickly and anxiously to his wife\u2019s face and he seemed to be relieved by\nwhat he saw there.",
    "Then he sat down at the other end of the table and\nMr. Mercado sat down in the vacant place by Mrs. Leidner.",
    "He was a tall\nthin melancholy man a good deal older than his wife with a sallow\ncomplexion and a queer soft shapelesslooking beard.",
    "I was glad when\nhe came in for his wife stopped staring at me and transferred her\nattention to him watching him with a kind of anxious impatience that I\nfound rather odd.",
    "He himself stirred his tea dreamily and said nothing at\nall.",
    "A piece of cake lay untasted on his plate.",
    "There was still one vacant place and presently the door opened and\na man came in.",
    "The moment I saw Richard Carey I felt he was one of the\nhandsomest men I\u2019d seen for a long time\u2014and yet I doubt if that were\nreally so.",
    "To say a man is handsome and at the same time to say he looks\nlike a death\u2019s head sounds a rank contradiction and yet it was true.",
    "His\nhead gave the effect of having the skin stretched unusually tight over the\nbones\u2014but they were beautiful bones.",
    "The lean line of jaw and temple\nand forehead was so sharply outlined that he reminded me of a bronze\nstatue.",
    "Out of this lean brown face looked two of the brightest and most\nintensely blue eyes I have ever seen.",
    "He stood about six foot and was I\nshould imagine a little under forty years of age.",
    "Dr. Leidner said \u201cThis is Mr. Carey our architect nurse.\u201d\nHe murmured something in a pleasant inaudible English voice and\nsat down by Mrs. Mercado.",
    "Mrs. Leidner said \u201cI\u2019m afraid the tea is a little cold Mr. Carey.\u201d\nHe said \u201cOh that\u2019s quite all right Mrs. Leidner.",
    "My fault for being\nlate.",
    "I wanted to finish plotting those walls.\u201d\nMrs. Mercado said \u201cJam Mr. Carey\u201d\nMr. Reiter pushed forward the toast.",
    "And I remembered Major Pennyman saying \u201cI can explain best\nwhat I mean by saying that they all passed the butter to each other a\nshade too politely.\u201d\nYes there was something a little odd about it. . . .\nA shade formal. . . .\nYou\u2019d have said it was a party of strangers\u2014not people who had\nknown each other\u2014some of them\u2014for quite a number of years.",
    "Six\nFIRST EVENING\n\nAfter tea Mrs. Leidner took me to show me my room.",
    "Perhaps here I had better give a short description of the arrangement\nof the rooms.",
    "This was very simple and can easily be understood by a\nreference to the plan.",
    "On either side of the big open porch were doors leading into the two\nprincipal rooms.",
    "That on the right led into the dining room where we\nhad tea.",
    "The one on the other side led into an exactly similar room I\nhave called it the living room which was used as a sitting room and kind\nof informal workroom\u2014that is a certain amount of drawing other than\nthe strictly architectural was done there and the more delicate pieces of\npottery were brought there to be pieced together.",
    "Through the living\nroom one passed into the antiquities room where all the finds from the\ndig were brought in and stored on shelves and in pigeonholes and also\nlaid out on big benches and tables.",
    "From the antika room there was no\nexit save through the living room.",
    "Beyond the antika room but reached through a door which gave on\nthe courtyard was Mrs. Leidner\u2019s bedroom.",
    "This like the other rooms\non that side of the house had a couple of barred windows looking out\nover the ploughed countryside.",
    "Round the corner next to Mrs. Leidner\u2019s\nroom but with no actual communicating door was Dr. Leidner\u2019s room.",
    "This was the first of the rooms on the east side of the building.",
    "Next to it\nwas the room that was to be mine.",
    "Next to me was Miss Johnson\u2019s with\nMr. and Mrs. Mercado\u2019s beyond.",
    "After that came two socalled\nbathrooms.",
    "When I once used that last term in the hearing of Dr. Reilly he\nlaughed at me and said a bathroom was either a bathroom or not a\n\n\fbathroom All the same when you\u2019ve got used to taps and proper\nplumbing it seems strange to call a couple of mudrooms with a tin hip\nbath in each of them and muddy water brought in kerosene tins\nbathrooms\nAll this side of the building had been added by Dr. Leidner to the\noriginal Arab house.",
    "The bedrooms were all the same each with a\nwindow and a door giving on to the courtyard.",
    "Along the north side were\nthe drawing office the laboratory and the photographic rooms.",
    "To return to the verandah the arrangement of rooms was much the\nsame on the other side.",
    "There was the dining room leading into the office\nwhere the files were kept and the cataloguing and typing was done.",
    "Corresponding to Mrs. Leidner\u2019s room was that of Father Lavigny who\nwas given the largest bedroom he used it also for the decoding\u2014or\nwhatever you call it\u2014of tablets.",
    "In the southwest corner was the staircase running up to the roof.",
    "On\nthe west side were first the kitchen quarters and then four small\nbedrooms used by the young men\u2014Carey Emmott Reiter and Coleman.",
    "At the northwest corner was the photographic room with the\ndarkroom leading out of it.",
    "Next to that the laboratory.",
    "Then came the\nonly entrance\u2014the big arched doorway through which we had entered.",
    "Outside were sleeping quarters for the native servants the guardhouse\nfor the soldiers and stables etc.",
    "for the water horses.",
    "The drawing\noffice was to the right of the archway occupying the rest of the north\nside.",
    "I have gone into the arrangements of the house rather fully here\nbecause I don\u2019t want to have to go over them again later.",
    "As I say Mrs. Leidner herself took me round the building and finally\nestablished me in my bedroom hoping that I should be comfortable and\nhave everything I wanted.",
    "The room was nicely though plainly furnished\u2014a bed a chest of\ndrawers a washstand and a chair.",
    "\u201cThe boys will bring you hot water before lunch and dinner\u2014and in\nthe morning of course.",
    "If you want it any other time go outside and clap\nyour hands and when the boy comes say jib mai\u2019 har.",
    "Do you think you\ncan remember that\u201d\n\n\fI said I thought so and repeated it a little haltingly.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s right.",
    "And be sure and shout it.",
    "Arabs don\u2019t understand\nanything said in an ordinary \u2018English\u2019 voice.\u201d\n\u201cLanguages are funny things\u201d I said.",
    "\u201cIt seems odd there should be\nsuch a lot of different ones.\u201d\nMrs. Leidner smiled.",
    "\u201cThere is a church in Palestine in which the Lord\u2019s Prayer is written\nup in\u2014ninety I think it is\u2014different languages.\u201d\n\u201cWell\u201d I said.",
    "\u201cI must write and tell my old aunt that.",
    "She will be\ninterested.\u201d\nMrs. Leidner fingered the jug and basin absently and shifted the soap\ndish an inch or two.\u201d\n\u201cI do hope you\u2019ll be happy here\u201d she said \u201cand not get too bored.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not often bored\u201d I assured her.",
    "\u201cLife\u2019s not long enough for\nthat.\u201d\nShe did not answer.",
    "She continued to toy with the washstand as\nthough abstractedly.",
    "Suddenly she fixed her dark violet eyes on my face.",
    "\u201cWhat exactly did my husband tell you nurse\u201d\nWell one usually says the same thing to a question of that kind.",
    "\u201cI gathered you were a bit rundown and all that Mrs. Leidner\u201d I\nsaid glibly.",
    "\u201cAnd that you just wanted someone to look after you and\ntake any worries off your hands.\u201d\nShe bent her head slowly and thoughtfully.",
    "\u201cYes\u201d she said.",
    "\u201cYes\u2014that will do very well.\u201d\nThat was just a little bit enigmatic but I wasn\u2019t going to question it.",
    "Instead I said \u201cI hope you\u2019ll let me help you with anything there is to do\nin the house.",
    "You mustn\u2019t let me be idle.\u201d\nShe smiled a little.",
    "\u201cThank you nurse.\u201d\nThen she sat down on the bed and rather to my surprise began to\ncrossquestion me rather closely.",
    "I say rather to my surprise because\nfrom the moment I set eyes on her I felt sure that Mrs. Leidner was a\nlady.",
    "And a lady in my experience very seldom displays curiosity about\none\u2019s private affairs.",
    "But Mrs. Leidner seemed anxious to know everything there was to\nknow about me.",
    "Where I\u2019d trained and how long ago.",
    "What had brought\nme out to the East.",
    "How it had come about that Dr. Reilly had\nrecommended me.",
    "She even asked me if I had ever been in America or\nhad any relations in America.",
    "One or two other questions she asked me\nthat seemed quite purposeless at the time but of which I saw the\nsignificance later.",
    "Then suddenly her manner changed.",
    "She smiled\u2014a warm sunny\nsmile\u2014and she said very sweetly that she was very glad I had come and\nthat she was sure I was going to be a comfort to her.",
    "She got up from the bed and said \u201cWould you like to come up to the\nroof and see the sunset It\u2019s usually very lovely about this time.\u201d\nI agreed willingly.",
    "As we went out of the room she asked \u201cWere there many other\npeople on the train from Baghdad Any men\u201d\nI said that I hadn\u2019t noticed anybody in particular.",
    "There had been two\nFrenchmen in the restaurant car the night before.",
    "And a party of three\nmen whom I gathered from their conversation had to do with the Pipe\nline.",
    "She nodded and a faint sound escaped her.",
    "It sounded like a small\nsigh of relief.",
    "We went up to the roof together.",
    "Mrs. Mercado was there sitting on the parapet and Dr. Leidner was\nbending over looking at a lot of stones and broken pottery that were laid\nin rows.",
    "There were big things he called querns and pestles and celts and\nstone axes and more broken bits of pottery with queer patterns on them\nthan I\u2019ve ever seen all at once.",
    "\u201cCome over here\u201d called out Mrs. Mercado.",
    "\u201cIsn\u2019t it too too\nbeautiful\u201d\nIt certainly was a beautiful sunset.",
    "Hassanieh in the distance looked\nquite fairylike with the setting sun behind it and the River Tigris\nflowing between its wide banks looked like a dream river rather than a\nreal one.",
    "\u201cIsn\u2019t it lovely Eric\u201d said Mrs. Leidner.",
    "The doctor looked up with abstracted eyes murmured \u201cLovely\nlovely\u201d perfunctorily and went on sorting potsherds.",
    "Mrs. Leidner smiled and said \u201cArchaeologists only look at what lies\nbeneath their feet.",
    "The sky and the heavens don\u2019t exist for them.\u201d\nMrs. Mercado giggled.",
    "\u201cOh they\u2019re very queer people\u2014you\u2019ll soon find that out nurse\u201d\nshe said.",
    "She paused and then added \u201cWe are all so glad you\u2019ve come.",
    "We\u2019ve\nbeen so very worried about dear Mrs. Leidner haven\u2019t we Louise\u201d\n\u201cHave you\u201d\nHer voice was not encouraging.",
    "\u201cOh yes.",
    "She really has been very bad nurse.",
    "All sorts of alarms\nand excursions.",
    "You know when anybody says to me of someone \u2018It\u2019s\njust nerves\u2019 I always say but what could be worse Nerves are the core\nand centre of one\u2019s being aren\u2019t they\u201d\n\u201cPuss puss\u201d I thought to myself.",
    "Mrs. Leidner said dryly \u201cWell you needn\u2019t be worried about me\nany more Marie.",
    "Nurse is going to look after me.\u201d\n\u201cCertainly I am\u201d I said cheerfully.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m sure that will make all the difference\u201d said Mrs. Mercado.",
    "\u201cWe\u2019ve all felt that she ought to see a doctor or do something.",
    "Her nerves\nhave really been all to pieces haven\u2019t they Louise dear\u201d\n\u201cSo much so that I seem to have got on your nerves with them\u201d said\nMrs. Leidner.",
    "\u201cShall we talk about something more interesting than my\nwretched ailments\u201d\nI understood then that Mrs. Leidner was the sort of woman who\ncould easily make enemies.",
    "There was a cool rudeness in her tone not\nthat I blamed her for it which brought a flush to Mrs. Mercado\u2019s rather\nsallow cheeks.",
    "She stammered out something but Mrs. Leidner had risen\nand had joined her husband at the other end of the roof.",
    "I doubt if he\nheard her coming till she laid her hand on his shoulder then he looked up\nquickly.",
    "There was affection and a kind of eager questioning in his face.",
    "Mrs. Leidner nodded her head gently.",
    "Presently her arm through his\nthey wandered to the far parapet and finally down the steps together.",
    "\u201cHe\u2019s devoted to her isn\u2019t he\u201d said Mrs. Mercado.",
    "\u201cYes\u201d I said.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s very nice to see.\u201d\nShe was looking at me with a queer rather eager sidelong glance.",
    "\u201cWhat do you think is really the matter with her nurse\u201d she asked\nlowering her voice a little.",
    "\u201cOh I don\u2019t suppose it\u2019s much\u201d I said cheerfully.",
    "\u201cJust a bit rundown I expect.\u201d\nHer eyes still bored into me as they had done at tea.",
    "She said\nabruptly \u201cAre you a mental nurse\u201d\n\u201cOh dear no\u201d I said.",
    "\u201cWhat made you think that\u201d\nShe was silent for a moment then she said \u201cDo you know how\nqueer she\u2019s been Did Dr. Leidner tell you\u201d\nI don\u2019t hold with gossiping about my cases.",
    "On the other hand it\u2019s\nmy experience that it\u2019s often very hard to get the truth out of relatives\nand until you know the truth you\u2019re often working in the dark and doing\nno good.",
    "Of course when there\u2019s a doctor in charge it\u2019s different.",
    "He\ntells you what it\u2019s necessary for you to know.",
    "But in this case there\nwasn\u2019t a doctor in charge.",
    "Dr. Reilly had never been called in\nprofessionally.",
    "And in my own mind I wasn\u2019t at all sure that Dr. Leidner\nhad told me all he could have done.",
    "It\u2019s often the husband\u2019s instinct to be\nreticent\u2014and more honour to him I must say.",
    "But all the same the more\nI knew the better I could tell which line to take.",
    "Mrs. Mercado whom I\nput down in my own mind as a thoroughly spiteful little cat was clearly\ndying to talk.",
    "And frankly on the human side as well as the professional\nI wanted to hear what she had to say.",
    "You can put it that I was just\neveryday curious if you like.",
    "I said \u201cI gather Mrs. Leidner\u2019s not been quite her normal self\nlately\u201d\nMrs. Mercado laughed disagreeably.",
    "\u201cNormal I should say not.",
    "Frightening us to death.",
    "One night it was\nfingers tapping on her window.",
    "And then it was a hand without an arm\nattached.",
    "But when it came to a yellow face pressed against the window\n\u2014and when she rushed to the window there was nothing there\u2014well I\nask you it is a bit creepy for all of us.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps somebody was playing a trick on her\u201d I suggested.",
    "\u201cOh no she fancied it all.",
    "And only three days ago at dinner they\nwere firing shots in the village\u2014nearly a mile away\u2014and she jumped up\nand screamed out\u2014it scared us all to death.",
    "As for Dr. Leidner he\nrushed to her and behaved in the most ridiculous way.",
    "\u2018It\u2019s nothing\ndarling it\u2019s nothing at all\u2019 he kept saying.",
    "I think you know nurse men\nsometimes encourage women in these hysterical fancies.",
    "It\u2019s a pity\nbecause it\u2019s a bad thing.",
    "Delusions shouldn\u2019t be encouraged.\u201d\n\u201cNot if they are delusions\u201d I said dryly.",
    "\u201cWhat else could they be\u201d\nI didn\u2019t answer because I didn\u2019t know what to say.",
    "It was a funny\nbusiness.",
    "The shots and the screaming were natural enough\u2014for anyone\nin a nervous condition that is.",
    "But this queer story of a spectral face and\nhand was different.",
    "It looked to me like one of two things\u2014either\nMrs. Leidner had made the story up exactly as a child shows off by\ntelling lies about something that never happened in order to make herself\nthe centre of attraction or else it was as I had suggested a deliberate\npractical joke.",
    "It was the sort of thing I reflected that an unimaginative\nhearty sort of young fellow like Mr. Coleman might think very funny.",
    "I\ndecided to keep a close watch on him.",
    "Nervous patients can be scared\nnearly out of their minds by a silly joke.",
    "Mrs. Mercado said with a sideways glance at me\n\u201cShe\u2019s very romanticlooking nurse don\u2019t you think so The sort of\nwoman things happen to.\u201d\n\u201cHave many things happened to her\u201d I asked.",
    "\u201cWell her first husband was killed in the war when she was only\ntwenty.",
    "I think that\u2019s very pathetic and romantic don\u2019t you\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s one way of calling a goose a swan\u201d I said dryly.",
    "\u201cOh nurse What an extraordinary remark\u201d\nIt was really a very true one.",
    "The amount of women you hear say \u201cIf\nDonald\u2014or Arthur\u2014or whatever his name was\u2014had only lived.\u201d And I\nsometimes think but if he had he\u2019d have been a stout unromantic shorttempered middleaged husband as likely as not.",
    "It was getting dark and I suggested that we should go down.",
    "Mrs. Mercado agreed and asked if I would like to see the laboratory.",
    "\u201cMy husband will be there\u2014working.\u201d\n\n\fI said I would like to very much and we made our way there.",
    "The\nplace was lighted by a lamp but it was empty.",
    "Mrs. Mercado showed me\nsome of the apparatus and some copper ornaments that were being\ntreated and also some bones coated with wax.",
    "\u201cWhere can Joseph be\u201d said Mrs. Mercado.",
    "She looked into the drawing office where Carey was at work.",
    "He\nhardly looked up as we entered and I was struck by the extraordinary\nlook of strain on his face.",
    "It came to me suddenly \u201cThis man is at the\nend of his tether.",
    "Very soon something will snap.\u201d And I remembered\nsomebody else had noticed that same tenseness about him.",
    "As we went out again I turned my head for one last look at him.",
    "He\nwas bent over his paper his lips pressed very closely together and that\n\u201cdeath\u2019s head\u201d suggestion of his bones very strongly marked.",
    "Perhaps it\nwas fanciful but I thought that he looked like a knight of old who was\ngoing into battle and knew he was going to be killed.",
    "And again I felt what an extraordinary and quite unconscious power\nof attraction he had.",
    "We found Mr. Mercado in the living room.",
    "He was explaining the\nidea of some new process to Mrs. Leidner.",
    "She was sitting on a straight\nwooden chair embroidering flowers in fine silks and I was struck anew\nby her strange fragile unearthly appearance.",
    "She looked a fairy creature\nmore than flesh and blood.",
    "Mrs. Mercado said her voice high and shrill \u201cOh there you are\nJoseph.",
    "We thought we\u2019d find you in the lab.\u201d\nHe jumped up looking startled and confused as though her entrance\nhad broken a spell.",
    "He said stammeringly \u201cI\u2014I must go now.",
    "I\u2019m in the\nmiddle of\u2014the middle of\u2014\u201d\nHe didn\u2019t complete the sentence but turned towards the door.",
    "Mrs. Leidner said in her soft drawling voice \u201cYou must finish\ntelling me some other time.",
    "It was very interesting.\u201d\nShe looked up at us smiled rather sweetly but in a faraway manner\nand bent over her embroidery again.",
    "In a minute or two she said \u201cThere are some books over there\nnurse.",
    "We\u2019ve got quite a good selection.",
    "Choose one and sit down.\u201d\n\n\fI went over to the bookshelf.",
    "Mrs. Mercado stayed for a minute or\ntwo then turning abruptly she went out.",
    "As she passed me I saw her\nface and I didn\u2019t like the look of it.",
    "She looked wild with fury.",
    "In spite of myself I remembered some of the things Mrs. Kelsey had\nsaid and hinted about Mrs. Leidner.",
    "I didn\u2019t like to think they were true\nbecause I liked Mrs. Leidner but I wondered nevertheless if there\nmightn\u2019t perhaps be a grain of truth behind them.",
    "I didn\u2019t think it was all her fault but the fact remained that dear ugly\nMiss Johnson and that common little spitfire Mrs. Mercado couldn\u2019t\nhold a candle to her in looks or in attraction.",
    "And after all men are men\nall over the world.",
    "You soon see a lot of that in my profession.",
    "Mercado was a poor fish and I don\u2019t suppose Mrs. Leidner really\ncared two hoots for his admiration\u2014but his wife cared.",
    "If I wasn\u2019t\nmistaken she minded badly and would be quite willing to do\nMrs. Leidner a bad turn if she could.",
    "I looked at Mrs. Leidner sitting there and sewing at her pretty\nflowers so remote and far away and aloof.",
    "I felt somehow I ought to\nwarn her.",
    "I felt that perhaps she didn\u2019t know how stupid and unreasoning\nand violent jealousy and hate can be\u2014and how little it takes to set them\nsmouldering.",
    "And then I said to myself \u201cAmy Leatheran you\u2019re a fool.",
    "Mrs. Leidner\u2019s no chicken.",
    "She\u2019s close on forty if she\u2019s a day and she\nmust know all about life there is to know.\u201d\nBut I felt that all the same perhaps she didn\u2019t.",
    "She had such a queer untouched look.",
    "I began to wonder what her life had been.",
    "I knew she\u2019d only married\nDr. Leidner two years ago.",
    "And according to Mrs. Mercado her first\nhusband had died about fifteen years ago.",
    "I came and sat down near her with a book and presently I went and\nwashed my hands for supper.",
    "It was a good meal\u2014some really excellent\ncurry.",
    "They all went to bed early and I was glad for I was tired.",
    "Dr. Leidner came with me to my room to see I had all I wanted.",
    "He gave me a warm handclasp and said eagerly\n\u201cShe likes you nurse.",
    "She\u2019s taken to you at once.",
    "I\u2019m so glad.",
    "I feel\neverything\u2019s going to be all right now.\u201d\n\n\fHis eagerness was almost boyish.",
    "I felt too that Mrs. Leidner had taken a liking to me and I was\npleased it should be so.",
    "But I didn\u2019t quite share his confidence.",
    "I felt somehow that there\nwas more to it all than he himself might know.",
    "There was something\u2014something I couldn\u2019t get at.",
    "But I felt it in the\nair.",
    "My bed was comfortable but I didn\u2019t sleep well for all that.",
    "I dreamt\ntoo much.",
    "The words of a poem by Keats that I\u2019d had to learn as a child kept\nrunning through my head.",
    "I kept getting them wrong and it worried me.",

    "Mr. Carey used to tell me that I hadn\u2019t got the archaeological\ntemperament and I\u2019ve no doubt he was quite right.",
    "The very first morning after my arrival Mr. Carey asked if I\u2019d like to\ncome and see the palace he was\u2014planning I think he called it.",
    "Though\nhow you can plan for a thing that\u2019s happened long ago I\u2019m sure I don\u2019t\nknow Well I said I\u2019d like to and to tell the truth I was a bit excited\nabout it.",
    "Nearly three thousand years old that palace was it appeared.",
    "I\nwondered what sort of palaces they had in those days and if it would be\nlike the pictures I\u2019d seen of Tutankahmen\u2019s tomb furniture.",
    "But would\nyou believe it there was nothing to see but mud Dirty mud walls about\ntwo feet high\u2014and that\u2019s all there was to it.",
    "Mr. Carey took me here and\nthere telling me things\u2014how this was the great court and there were\nsome chambers here and an upper storey and various other rooms that\nopened off the central court.",
    "And all I thought was \u201cBut how does he\nknow\u201d though of course I was too polite to say so.",
    "I can tell you it was\na disappointment The whole excavation looked like nothing but mud to\nme\u2014no marble or gold or anything handsome\u2014my aunt\u2019s house in\nCricklewood would have made a much more imposing ruin And those\nold Assyrians or whatever they were called themselves kings.",
    "When\nMr. Carey had shown me his old \u201cpalaces\u201d he handed me over to Father\nLavigny who showed me the rest of the mound.",
    "I was a little afraid of\nFather Lavigny being a monk and a foreigner and having such a deep\n\n\fvoice and all that but he was very kind\u2014though rather vague.",
    "Sometimes I felt it wasn\u2019t much more real to him than it was to me.",
    "Mrs. Leidner explained that later.",
    "She said that Father Lavigny was\nonly interested in \u201cwritten documents\u201d\u2014as she called them.",
    "They wrote\neverything on clay these people queer heathenishlooking marks too\nbut quite sensible.",
    "There were even school tablets\u2014the teacher\u2019s lesson\non one side and the pupil\u2019s effort on the back of it.",
    "I confess that that did\ninterest me rather\u2014it seemed so human if you know what I mean.",
    "Father Lavigny walked round the work with me and showed me\nwhat were temples or palaces and what were private houses and also a\nplace which he said was an early Akkadian cemetery.",
    "He spoke in a\nfunny jerky way just throwing in a scrap of information and then\nreverting to other subjects.",
    "He said \u201cIt is strange that you have come here.",
    "Is Mrs. Leidner\nreally ill then\u201d\n\u201cNot exactly ill\u201d I said cautiously.",
    "He said \u201cShe is an odd woman.",
    "A dangerous woman I think.\u201d\n\u201cNow what do you mean by that\u201d I said.",
    "\u201cDangerous How\ndangerous\u201d\nHe shook his head thoughtfully.",

    "\u201cYou do not know women as I do\u201d he said.",
    "And that was a funny thing I thought for a monk to say.",
    "But of\ncourse I suppose he might have heard a lot of things in confession.",
    "But\nthat rather puzzled me because I wasn\u2019t sure if monks heard confessions\nor if it was only priests.",
    "I supposed he was a monk with that long\nwoollen robe\u2014all sweeping up the dirt\u2014and the rosary and all\n\u201cYes she could be ruthless\u201d he said musingly.",

    "\u201cIt is odd here You find it odd Or quite natural\u201d\n\u201cNot quite natural\u201d I said considering.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s comfortable enough as\nfar as the arrangements go\u2014but there isn\u2019t quite a comfortable feeling.\u201d\n\u201cIt makes me uncomfortable.",
    "I have the idea\u201d\u2014he became suddenly\na little more foreign\u2014\u201cthat something prepares itself.",
    "Dr. Leidner too\nhe is not quite himself.",
    "Something is worrying him also.\u201d\n\u201cHis wife\u2019s health\u201d\n\u201cThat perhaps.",
    "But there is more.",
    "There is\u2014how shall I say it\u2014an\nuneasiness.\u201d\nAnd that was just it there was an uneasiness.",
    "We didn\u2019t say any more just then for Dr. Leidner came towards us.",
    "He showed me a child\u2019s grave that had just been uncovered.",
    "Rather\npathetic it was\u2014the little bones\u2014and a pot or two and some little specks\nthat Dr. Leidner told me were a bead necklace.",
    "It was the workmen that made me laugh.",
    "You never saw such a lot of\nscarecrows\u2014all in long petticoats and rags and their heads tied up as\nthough they had toothache.",
    "And every now and then as they went to and\nfro carrying away baskets of earth they began to sing\u2014at least I suppose\nit was meant to be singing\u2014a queer sort of monotonous chant that went\non and on over and over again.",
    "I noticed that most of their eyes were\nterrible\u2014all covered with discharge and one or two looked half blind.",
    "I\nwas just thinking what a miserable lot they were when Dr. Leidner said\n\u201cRather a finelooking lot of men aren\u2019t they\u201d and I thought what a\nqueer world it was and how two different people could see the same\nthing each of them the other way round.",
    "I haven\u2019t put that very well but\nyou can guess what I mean.",
    "After a bit Dr. Leidner said he was going back to the house for a\nmidmorning cup of tea.",
    "So he and I walked back together and he told\nme things.",
    "When he explained it was all quite different.",
    "I sort of saw it\nall\u2014how it used to be\u2014the streets and the houses and he showed me\novens where they baked bread and said the Arabs used much the same\nkind of ovens nowadays.",
    "We got back to the house and found Mrs. Leidner had got up.",
    "She\nwas looking better today not so thin and worn.",
    "Tea came in almost at\nonce and Dr. Leidner told her what had turned up during the morning on\nthe dig.",
    "Then he went back to work and Mrs. Leidner asked me if I\nwould like to see some of the finds they had made up to date.",
    "Of course I\nsaid \u201cYes\u201d so she took me through into the antika room.",
    "There was a lot\nof stuff lying about\u2014mostly broken pots it seemed to me\u2014or else ones\nthat were all mended and stuck together.",
    "The whole lot might have been\nthrown away I thought.",
    "\u201cDear dear\u201d I said \u201cit\u2019s a pity they\u2019re all so broken isn\u2019t it Are\nthey really worth keeping\u201d\nMrs. Leidner smiled a little and she said \u201cYou mustn\u2019t let Eric hear\nyou.",
    "Pots interest him more than anything else and some of these are the\noldest things we have\u2014perhaps as much as seven thousand years old.\u201d\nAnd she explained how some of them came from a very deep cut on the\nmound down towards the bottom and how thousands of years ago they\nhad been broken and mended with bitumen showing people prized their\nthings just as much then as they do nowadays.",
    "\u201cAnd now\u201d she said \u201cwe\u2019ll show you something more exciting.\u201d\nAnd she took down a box from the shelf and showed me a beautiful\ngold dagger with darkblue stones in the handle.",
    "I exclaimed with pleasure.",
    "Mrs. Leidner laughed.",
    "\u201cYes everybody likes gold Except my husband.\u201d\n\u201cWhy doesn\u2019t Dr. Leidner like it\u201d\n\u201cWell for one thing it comes expensive.",
    "You have to pay the\nworkmen who find it the weight of the object in gold.\u201d\n\u201cGood gracious\u201d I exclaimed.",
    "\u201cBut why\u201d\n\u201cOh it\u2019s a custom.",
    "For one thing it prevents them from stealing.",
    "You\nsee if they did steal it wouldn\u2019t be for the archaeological value but for\nthe intrinsic value.",
    "They could melt it down.",
    "So we make it easy for them\nto be honest.\u201d\nShe took down another tray and showed me a really beautiful gold\ndrinking cup with a design of rams\u2019 heads on it.",
    "Again I exclaimed.",
    "\u201cYes it is beautiful isn\u2019t it These came from a prince\u2019s grave.",
    "We\nfound other royal graves but most of them had been plundered.",
    "This cup\nis our best find.",
    "It is one of the most lovely ever found anywhere.",
    "Early\nAkkadian.",
    "Unique.\u201d\nSuddenly with a frown Mrs. Leidner brought the cup up close to\nher eyes and scratched at it delicately with her nail.",
    "\u201cHow extraordinary There\u2019s actually wax on it.",
    "Someone must have\nbeen in here with a candle.\u201d She detached the little flake and replaced the\ncup in its place.",
    "After that she showed me some queer little terracotta figurines\u2014but\nmost of them were just rude.",
    "Nasty minds those old people had I say.",
    "When we went back to the porch Mrs. Mercado was sitting polishing\nher nails.",
    "She was holding them out in front of her admiring the effect.",
    "I\nthought myself that anything more hideous than that orange red could\nhardly have been imagined.",
    "Mrs. Leidner had brought with her from the antika room a very\ndelicate little saucer broken in several pieces and this she now\nproceeded to join together.",
    "I watched her for a minute or two and then\nasked if I could help.",
    "\u201cOh yes there are plenty more.\u201d She fetched quite a supply of\nbroken pottery and we set to work.",
    "I soon got into the hang of it and she\npraised my ability.",
    "I suppose most nurses are handy with their fingers.",
    "\u201cHow busy everybody is\u201d said Mrs. Mercado.",
    "\u201cIt makes me feel\ndreadfully idle.",
    "Of course I am idle.\u201d\n\u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t you be if you like\u201d said Mrs. Leidner.",
    "Her voice was quite uninterested.",
    "At twelve we had lunch.",
    "Afterwards Dr. Leidner and Mr. Mercado\ncleaned some pottery pouring a solution of hydrochloric acid over it.",
    "One pot went a lovely plum colour and a pattern of bulls\u2019 horns came out\non another one.",
    "It was really quite magical.",
    "All the dried mud that no\nwashing would remove sort of foamed and boiled away.",
    "Mr. Carey and Mr. Coleman went out on the dig and Mr. Reiter went\noff to the photographic room.",
    "\u201cWhat will you do Louise\u201d Dr. Leidner asked his wife.",
    "\u201cI suppose\nyou\u2019ll rest for a bit\u201d\n\n\fI gathered that Mrs. Leidner usually lay down every afternoon.",
    "\u201cI\u2019ll rest for about an hour.",
    "Then perhaps I\u2019ll go out for a short\nstroll.\u201d\n\u201cGood.",
    "Nurse will go with you won\u2019t you\u201d\n\u201cOf course\u201d I said.",
    "\u201cNo no\u201d said Mrs. Leidner \u201cI like going alone.",
    "Nurse isn\u2019t to feel\nso much on duty that I\u2019m not allowed out of her sight.\u201d\n\u201cOh but I\u2019d like to come\u201d I said.",
    "\u201cNo really I\u2019d rather you didn\u2019t.\u201d She was quite firm\u2014almost\nperemptory.",
    "\u201cI must be by myself every now and then.",
    "It\u2019s necessary to\nme.\u201d\nI didn\u2019t insist of course.",
    "But as I went off for a short sleep myself it\nstruck me as odd that Mrs. Leidner with her nervous terrors should be\nquite content to walk by herself without any kind of protection.",
    "When I came out of my room at halfpast three the courtyard was\ndeserted save for a little boy with a large copper bath who was washing\npottery and Mr. Emmott who was sorting and arranging it.",
    "As I went\ntowards them Mrs. Leidner came in through the archway.",
    "She looked\nmore alive than I had seen her yet.",
    "Her eyes shone and she looked\nuplifted and almost gay.",
    "Dr. Leidner came out from the laboratory and joined her.",
    "He was\nshowing her a big dish with bulls\u2019 horns on it.",
    "\u201cThe prehistoric levels are being extraordinarily productive\u201d he\nsaid.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s been a good season so far.",
    "Finding that tomb right at the\nbeginning was a real piece of luck.",
    "The only person who might complain\nis Father Lavigny.",
    "We\u2019ve had hardly any tablets so far.\u201d\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t seem to have done very much with the few we have\nhad\u201d said Mrs. Leidner dryly.",
    "\u201cHe may be a very fine epigraphist but\nhe\u2019s a remarkably lazy one.",
    "He spends all his afternoons sleeping.\u201d\n\u201cWe miss Byrd\u201d said Dr. Leidner.",
    "\u201cThis man strikes me as slightly\nunorthodox\u2014though of course I\u2019m not competent to judge.",
    "But one or\ntwo of his translations have been surprising to say the least of it.",
    "I can\nhardly believe for instance that he\u2019s right about that inscribed brick and\nyet he must know.\u201d\n\n\fAfter tea Mrs. Leidner asked me if I would like to stroll down to the\nriver.",
    "I thought that perhaps she feared that her refusal to let me\naccompany her earlier in the afternoon might have hurt my feelings.",
    "I wanted her to know that I wasn\u2019t the touchy kind so I accepted at\nonce.",
    "It was a lovely evening.",
    "A path led between barley fields and then\nthrough some flowering fruit trees.",
    "Finally we came to the edge of the\nTigris.",
    "Immediately on our left was the Tell with the workmen singing in\ntheir queer monotonous chant.",
    "A little to our right was a big waterwheel\nwhich made a queer groaning noise.",
    "It used to set my teeth on edge at\nfirst.",
    "But in the end I got fond of it and it had a queer soothing effect on\nme.",
    "Beyond the waterwheel was the village from which most of the\nworkmen came.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s rather beautiful isn\u2019t it\u201d said Mrs. Leidner.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s very peaceful\u201d I said.",
    "\u201cIt seems funny to me to be so far away\nfrom everywhere.\u201d\n\u201cFar from everywhere\u201d repeated Mrs. Leidner.",
    "\u201cYes.",
    "Here at least\none might expect to be safe.\u201d\nI glanced at her sharply but I think she was speaking more to herself\nthan to me and I don\u2019t think she realized that her words had been\nrevealing.",
    "We began to walk back to the house.",
    "Suddenly Mrs. Leidner clutched my arm so violently that I nearly\ncried out.",
    "\u201cWho\u2019s that nurse What\u2019s he doing\u201d\nSome distance ahead of us just where the path ran near the\nexpedition house a man was standing.",
    "He wore European clothes and he\nseemed to be standing on tiptoe and trying to look in at one of the\nwindows.",
    "As we watched he glanced round caught sight of us and\nimmediately continued on the path towards us.",
    "I felt Mrs. Leidner\u2019s\nclutch tighten.",
    "\u201cNurse\u201d she whispered.",
    "\u201cNurse . . .\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s all right my dear it\u2019s all right\u201d I said reassuringly.",
    "The man came along and passed us.",
    "He was an Iraqi and as soon as\nshe saw him near to Mrs. Leidner relaxed with a sigh.",
    "\u201cHe\u2019s only an Iraqi after all\u201d she said.",
    "We went on our way.",
    "I glanced up at the windows as I passed.",
    "Not\nonly were they barred but they were too high from the ground to permit\nof anyone seeing in for the level of the ground was lower here than on\nthe inside of the courtyard.",
    "\u201cIt must have been just curiosity\u201d I said.",
    "Mrs. Leidner nodded.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s all.",
    "But just for a minute I thought\u2014\u201d\nShe broke off.",
    "I thought to myself.",
    "\u201cYou thought what That\u2019s what I\u2019d like to\nknow.",
    "What did you think\u201d\nBut I knew one thing now\u2014that Mrs. Leidner was afraid of a\ndefinite fleshandblood person.",

    "Looking back as I do from my present standpoint of knowledge I can\nsee a good many little signs and indications that I was quite blind to at\nthe time.",
    "To tell the story properly however I think I ought to try to recapture\nthe point of view that I actually held\u2014puzzled uneasy and increasingly\nconscious of something wrong.",
    "For one thing was certain that curious sense of strain and constraint\nwas not imagined.",
    "It was genuine.",

    "I had\ntaken rather a fancy to Mr. Emmott his taciturnity was not I felt sure\nunfriendly.",
    "There was something about him that seemed very steadfast\nand reassuring in an atmosphere where one was uncertain what anyone\nwas feeling or thinking.",
    "\u201cNo\u201d he said in answer to Mr. Coleman.",
    "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t like this last\nyear.\u201d\nBut he didn\u2019t enlarge on the theme or say any more.",

    "I liked\nher very much.",
    "She was capable practical and intelligent.",
    "She had it was\n\n\fquite obvious a distinct hero worship for Dr. Leidner.",

    "We didn\u2019t need her to tell us so I\nwondered if perhaps she was feeling a bit remorseful for the harsh\nfeelings she had harboured against the dead woman and all the spiteful\nthings she had said.",
    "After a minute or two she asked rather breathlessly \u201cWhat are you\ngoing to do\u201d\nMr. Emmott took charge in his quiet way.",

    "He just looked young and frightened.",
    "Without a word he jumped into the\nstation wagon and drove off.",
    "Mr. Emmott said rather uncertainly \u201cI suppose we ought to have a\nhunt round.\u201d He raised his voice and called \u201cIbrahim\u201d\n\u201cNa\u2019am.\u201d\nThe houseboy came running.",
    "Mr. Emmott spoke to him in Arabic.",
    "A\nvigorous colloquy passed between them.",

    "No stranger of any kind.",

    "I pass over the events of the next two hours the arrival of\nCaptain Maitland and the police and Dr. Reilly.",
    "There was a good deal of\ngeneral confusion questioning all the routine business I suppose.",
    "In my opinion we began to get down to brass tacks about five\no\u2019clock when Dr. Reilly asked me to come with him into the office.",
    "He\nshut the door sat down in Dr. Leidner\u2019s chair motioned me to sit down\nopposite him and said briskly \u201cNow then nurse let\u2019s get down to it.",

    "It was twenty to three\nthen.\u201d\n\u201cLet\u2019s have a look at this watch of yours.\u201d\nI slipped it off my wrist and held it out to him.",

    "I examined the body at half past four and I\u2019m inclined to\nput the time of death between 115 and 145.",
    "We\u2019ll say half past one at a\nguess.",
    "That\u2019s near enough.\u201d\nHe stopped and drummed thoughtfully with his fingers on the table.",

    "It was then that I\u2014heard.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you began to work in the photographic room\u2014when\u201d\n\u201cAt ten minutes to one.\u201d\n\u201cWere you acquainted with Mrs. Leidner before you joined this\nexpedition\u201d\nThe young man shook his head.",

    "\u201cI saw no one at all.",
    "Nobody even came out into the courtyard\nduring the two hours I was working.\u201d\n\u201cAnd to the best of your belief it was half past one when both you\nand the boy were absent and the courtyard was empty\u201d\n\u201cIt couldn\u2019t have been far off that time.",
    "Of course I can\u2019t say\nexactly.\u201d\nPoirot turned to Dr. Reilly.",

    "But we mustn\u2019t give way.",
    "It makes it\nso much more difficult for poor Dr. Leidner.\u201d\nI saw a spasm of pain pass across Dr. Leidner\u2019s face and I guessed\nthat this emotional atmosphere was not easy for him.",
    "He gave a half\nglance at Poirot as though in appeal.",
    "Poirot responded quickly.",
    "\u201cMiss Johnson\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m afraid I can tell you very little\u201d said Miss Johnson.",

    "\u201cSomething you heard then.",
    "Ah yes something you are not quite\nsure whether you heard or not\u201d\nMiss Johnson gave a short vexed laugh.",
    "\u201cYou press me very closely M. Poirot.",
    "I\u2019m afraid you are\nencouraging me to tell you what I am perhaps only imagining.\u201d\n\u201cThen there was something you\u2014shall we say\u2014imagined\u201d\n\n\fMiss Johnson said slowly weighing her words in a detached way \u201cI\nhave imagined\u2014since\u2014that at some time during the afternoon I heard a\nvery faint cry .",
    ". . What I mean is that I daresay I did hear a cry.",
    "All the\nwindows in the living room were open and one hears all sorts of sounds\nfrom people working in the barley fields.",

    "And\nthat\u2019s made me rather unhappy.",

    "No second blow was struck.",
    "Otherwise she would have had\ntime to call for help and make a real outcry.\u201d\n\u201cStill I might have caught the murderer\u201d said Miss Johnson.",

    "\u201cThat fatal ten minutes.\u201d\nThere was a momentary silence.",
    "Miss Johnson lifted her head suddenly and said \u201cYou know\nM. Poirot I think I have unintentionally misled you.",
    "On thinking it over\nI do not believe that I could possibly have heard any cry uttered in\nMrs. Leidner\u2019s room from where I was.",
    "The antika room lay between me\nand her\u2014and I understand her windows were found closed.\u201d\n\u201cIn any case do not distress yourself mademoiselle\u201d said Poirot\nkindly.",

    "But there would have\nbeen this difficulty the former husband would have had to resurrect\nhimself in order to claim it and I should imagine that he would then be\nin danger of arrest though I hardly fancy that the death penalty would be\nexacted so long after the war.",
    "However these speculations need not\narise.",
    "As I say I settle first the question of money.",
    "For the next step I\nproceed always to suspect the husband or wife of the deceased In this\ncase in the first place you are proved never to have gone near your\nwife\u2019s room yesterday afternoon in the second place you lose instead of\ngain by your wife\u2019s death and in the third place\u2014\u201d\nHe paused.",
    "\u201cYes\u201d said Dr. Leidner.",
    "\u201cIn the third place\u201d said Poirot slowly \u201cI can I think appreciate\ndevotion when I see it.",
    "I believe Dr. Leidner that your love for your\nwife was the ruling passion of your life.",
    "It is so is it not\u201d\nDr. Leidner answered quite simply \u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\fPoirot nodded.",
    "\u201cTherefore\u201d he said \u201cwe can proceed.\u201d\n\u201cHear hear let\u2019s get down to it\u201d said Dr. Reilly with some\nimpatience.",
    "Poirot gave him a reproving glance.",
    "\u201cMy friend do not be impatient.",
    "In a case like this everything must\nbe approached with order and method.",
    "In fact that is my rule in every\ncase.",
    "Having disposed of certain possibilities we now approach a very\nimportant point.",
    "It is vital that as you say\u2014all the cards should be on the\ntable\u2014there must be nothing kept back.\u201d\n\u201cQuite so\u201d said Dr. Reilly.",
    "\u201cThat is why I demand the whole truth\u201d went on Poirot.",
    "Dr. Leidner looked at him in surprise.",
    "\u201cI assure you M. Poirot that I have kept nothing back.",
    "I have told\nyou everything that I know.",
    "There have been no reserves.\u201d\n\u201cTout de m\u00eame you have not told me everything.\u201d\n\u201cYes indeed.",
    "I cannot think of any detail that has escaped me.\u201d\nHe looked quite distressed.",
    "Poirot shook his head gently.",
    "\u201cNo\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cYou have not told me for instance why you installed\nNurse Leatheran in the house.\u201d\nDr. Leidner looked completely bewildered.",
    "\u201cBut I have explained that.",
    "It is obvious.",
    "My wife\u2019s nervousness\u2014\nher fears . . .\u201d\nPoirot leaned forward.",
    "Slowly and emphatically he wagged a finger\nup and down.",
    "\u201cNo no no.",
    "There is something there that is not clear.",
    "Your wife is\nin danger yes\u2014she is threatened with death yes.",
    "You send\u2014not for the\npolice\u2014not for a private detective even\u2014but for a nurse It does not\nmake the sense that\u201d\n\u201cI\u2014I\u2014\u201d Dr. Leidner stopped.",
    "The colour rose in his cheeks.",
    "\u201cI\nthought\u2014\u201d He came to a dead stop.",
    "\u201cNow we are coming to it\u201d Poirot encouraged him.",
    "\u201cYou thought\u2014\nwhat\u201d\nDr. Leidner remained silent.",
    "He looked harassed and unwilling.",
    "\u201cSee you\u201d Poirot\u2019s tone became winning and appealing \u201cit all rings\nwhat you have told me except for that.",
    "Why a nurse There is an answer\n\u2014yes.",
    "In fact there can be only one answer.",
    "You did not believe yourself\nin your wife\u2019s danger.\u201d\nAnd then with a cry Dr. Leidner broke down.",
    "\u201cGod help me\u201d he groaned.",
    "\u201cI didn\u2019t.",
    "I didn\u2019t.\u201d\nPoirot watched him with the kind of attention a cat gives a mousehole\u2014ready to pounce when the mouse shows itself.",
    "\u201cWhat did you think then\u201d he asked.",
    "\u201cI don\u2019t know.",
    "I don\u2019t know.",
    ". . .\u201d\n\u201cBut you do know.",
    "You know perfectly.",
    "Perhaps I can help you\u2014\nwith a guess.",
    "Did you Dr. Leidner suspect that these letters were all\nwritten by your wife herself\u201d\nThere wasn\u2019t any need for him to answer.",
    "The truth of Poirot\u2019s guess\nwas only too apparent.",
    "The horrified hand he held up as though begging\nfor mercy told its own tale.",
    "I drew a deep breath.",
    "So I had been right in my halfformed guess I\nrecalled the curious tone in which Dr. Leidner had asked me what I\nthought of it all.",
    "I nodded my head slowly and thoughtfully and\nsuddenly awoke to the fact that M. Poirot\u2019s eyes were on me.",
    "\u201cDid you think the same nurse\u201d\n\u201cThe idea did cross my mind\u201d I said truthfully.",
    "\u201cFor what reason\u201d\nI explained the similarity of the handwriting on the letter that\nMr. Coleman had shown me.",
    "Poirot turned to Dr. Leidner.",
    "\u201cHad you too noticed that similarity\u201d\nDr. Leidner bowed his head.",
    "\u201cYes I did.",
    "The writing was small and cramped\u2014not big and\ngenerous like Louise\u2019s but several of the letters were formed the same\nway.",
    "I will show you.\u201d\nFrom an inner breast pocket he took out some letters and finally\nselected a sheet from one which he handed to Poirot.",
    "It was part of a\nletter written to him by his wife.",
    "Poirot compared it carefully with the\nanonymous letters.",
    "\u201cYes\u201d he murmured.",
    "\u201cYes.",
    "There are several similarities\u2014a curious\nway of forming the letter s a distinctive e. I am not a handwriting expert\n\u2014I cannot pronounce definitely and for that matter I have never found\ntwo handwriting experts who agree on any point whatsoever\u2014but one\ncan at least say this\u2014the similarity between the two handwritings is very\nmarked.",
    "It seems highly probable that they were all written by the same\nperson.",
    "But it is not certain.",
    "We must take all contingencies into mind.\u201d\nHe leaned back in his chair and said thoughtfully \u201cThere are three\npossibilities.",
    "First the similarity of the handwriting is pure coincidence.",
    "Second that these threatening letters were written by Mrs. Leidner\nherself for some obscure reason.",
    "Third that they were written by\nsomeone who deliberately copied her handwriting.",
    "Why There seems\nno sense in it.",
    "One of these three possibilities must be the correct one.\u201d\nHe reflected for a minute or two and then turning to Dr. Leidner he\nasked with a resumal of his brisk manner \u201cWhen the possibility that\nMrs. Leidner herself was the author of these letters first struck you what\ntheory did you form\u201d\nDr. Leidner shook his head.",
    "\u201cI put the idea out of my head as quickly as possible.",
    "I felt it was\nmonstrous.\u201d\n\u201cDid you search for no explanation\u201d\n\u201cWell\u201d he hesitated.",
    "\u201cI wondered if worrying and brooding over the\npast had perhaps affected my wife\u2019s brain slightly.",
    "I thought she might\npossibly have written those letters to herself without being conscious of\nhaving done so.",
    "That is possible isn\u2019t it\u201d he added turning to\nDr. Reilly.",
    "Dr. Reilly pursed up his lips.",
    "\u201cThe human brain is capable of almost anything\u201d he replied\nvaguely.",
    "But he shot a lightning glance at Poirot and as if in obedience to it\nthe latter abandoned the subject.",
    "\u201cThe letters are an interesting point\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cBut we must\nconcentrate on the case as a whole.",
    "There are as I see it three possible\nsolutions.\u201d\n\u201cThree\u201d\n\n\f\u201cYes.",
    "Solution one the simplest.",
    "Your wife\u2019s first husband is still\nalive.",
    "He first threatens her and then proceeds to carry out his threats.",
    "If\nwe accept this solution our problem is to discover how he got in or out\nwithout being seen.",
    "\u201cSolution two Mrs. Leidner for reasons of her own reasons\nprobably more easily understood by a medical man than a layman\nwrites herself threatening letters.",
    "The gas business is staged by her\nremember it was she who roused you by telling you she smelt gas.",
    "But\nif Mrs. Leidner wrote herself the letters she cannot be in danger from\nthe supposed writer.",
    "We must therefore look elsewhere for the\nmurderer.",
    "We must look in fact amongst the members of your staff.",
    "Yes\u201d in answer to a murmur of protest from Dr. Leidner \u201cthat is the only\nlogical conclusion.",
    "To satisfy a private grudge one of them killed her.",
    "That person I may say was probably aware of the letters\u2014or was at any\nrate aware that Mrs. Leidner feared or was pretending to fear someone.",
    "That fact in the murderer\u2019s opinion rendered the murder quite safe for\nhim.",
    "He felt sure it would be put down to a mysterious outsider\u2014the\nwriter of the threatening letters.",
    "\u201cA variant of this solution is that the murderer actually wrote the\nletters himself being aware of Mrs. Leidner\u2019s past history.",
    "But in that\ncase it is not quite clear why the criminal should have copied\nMrs. Leidner\u2019s own handwriting since as far as we can see it would be\nmore to his or her advantage that they should appear to be written by an\noutsider.",
    "\u201cThe third solution is the most interesting to my mind.",
    "I suggest that\nthe letters are genuine.",
    "They are written by Mrs. Leidner\u2019s first husband\nor his younger brother who is actually one of the expedition staff.\u201d\n\n\fSixteen\nTHE SUSPECTS\n\nDr. Leidner sprang to his feet.",
    "\u201cImpossible Absolutely impossible The idea is absurd\u201d\nMr. Poirot looked at him quite calmly but said nothing.",
    "\u201cYou mean to suggest that my wife\u2019s former husband is one of the\nexpedition and that she didn\u2019t recognize him\u201d\n\u201cExactly.",
    "Reflect a little on the facts.",
    "Some fifteen years ago your\nwife lived with this man for a few months.",
    "Would she know him if she\ncame across him after that lapse of time I think not.",
    "His face will have\nchanged his build will have changed\u2014his voice may not have changed\nso much but that is a detail he can attend to himself.",
    "And remember she\nis not looking for him amongst her own household.",
    "She visualizes him as\nsomewhere outside\u2014a stranger.",
    "No I do not think she would recognize\nhim.",
    "And there is a second possibility.",
    "The young brother\u2014the child of\nthose days who was so passionately devoted to his elder brother.",
    "He is\nnow a man.",
    "Will she recognize a child of ten or twelve years old in a\nman nearing thirty Yes there is young William Bosner to be reckoned\nwith.",
    "Remember his brother in his eyes may not loom as a traitor but as\na patriot a martyr for his own country\u2014Germany.",
    "In his eyes\nMrs. Leidner is the traitor\u2014the monster who sent his beloved brother to\ndeath A susceptible child is capable of great hero worship and a young\nmind can easily be obsessed by an idea which persists into adult life.\u201d\n\u201cQuite true\u201d said Dr. Reilly.",
    "\u201cThe popular view that a child forgets\neasily is not an accurate one.",
    "Many people go right through life in the\ngrip of an idea which has been impressed on them in very tender years.\u201d\n\u201cBien.",
    "You have these two possibilities.",
    "Frederick Bosner a man by\nnow of fifty odd and William Bosner whose age would be something\n\n\fshort of thirty.",
    "Let us examine the members of your staff from these two\npoints of view.\u201d\n\u201cThis is fantastic\u201d murmured Dr. Leidner.",
    "\u201cMy staff The members\nof my own expedition.\u201d\n\u201cAnd consequently considered above suspicion\u201d said Poirot dryly.",
    "\u201cA very useful point of view.",
    "Commen\u00e7ons Who could emphatically not\nbe Frederick or William\u201d\n\u201cThe women.\u201d\n\u201cNaturally.",

    "He and I have worked together for years before I even met\nLouise\u2014\u201d\n\u201cAnd also he is the wrong age.",
    "He is I should judge thirtyeight or\nnine too young for Frederick too old for William.",
    "Now for the rest.",
    "There is Father Lavigny and Mr. Mercado.",
    "Either of them might be\nFrederick Bosner.\u201d\n\u201cBut my dear sir\u201d cried Dr. Leidner in a voice of mingled irritation\nand amusement \u201cFather Lavigny is known all over the world as an\nepigraphist and Mercado has worked for years in a wellknown museum\nin New York.",
    "It is impossible that either of them should be the man you\nthink\u201d\nPoirot waved an airy hand.",
    "\u201cImpossible\u2014impossible\u2014I take no account of the word The\nimpossible always I examine it very closely But we will pass on for the\nmoment.",
    "Who else have you Carl Reiter a young man with a German\nname David Emmott\u2014\u201d\n\u201cHe has been with me two seasons remember.\u201d\n\u201cHe is a young man with the gift of patience.",
    "If he committed a\ncrime it would not be in a hurry.",
    "All would be very well prepared.\u201d\nDr. Leidner made a gesture of despair.",

    "I was thinking hard.",
    "Right from the beginning I had thought\nMr. Coleman\u2019s manner rather more like a P. G. Wodehouse book than\nlike a real live young man.",
    "Had he really been playing a part all the time\nPoirot was writing in a little book.",

    "Who amongst the expedition had the means and the\nopportunity of committing the crime Carey was on the dig Coleman\nwas in Hassanieh you yourself were on the roof.",
    "That leaves us Father\nLavigny Mr. Mercado Mrs. Mercado David Emmott Carl Reiter\nMiss Johnson and Nurse Leatheran.\u201d\n\u201cOh\u201d I exclaimed and I bounded in my chair.",
    "Mr. Poirot looked at me with twinkling eyes.",
    "\u201cYes I\u2019m afraid ma soeur that you have got to be included.",
    "It\nwould have been quite easy for you to have gone along and killed\nMrs. Leidner while the courtyard was empty.",
    "You have plenty of muscle\nand strength and she would have been quite unsuspicious until the\nmoment the blow was struck.\u201d\nI was so upset that I couldn\u2019t get a word out.",
    "Dr. Reilly I noticed\nwas looking highly amused.",
    "\u201cInteresting case of a nurse who murdered her patients one by one\u201d\nhe murmured.",
    "Such a look as I gave him\nDr. Leidner\u2019s mind had been running on a different tack.",
    "\u201cNot Emmott M. Poirot\u201d he objected.",
    "\u201cYou can\u2019t include him.",
    "He\nwas on the roof with me remember during that ten minutes.\u201d\n\u201cNevertheless we cannot exclude him.",

    "\u201cBut I\nquestioned him closely and it\u2019s obvious that he didn\u2019t actually change\nher position.\u201d\n\u201cIt seems quite straightforward\u201d said Poirot.",
    "\u201cShe was lying on the\nbed asleep or resting\u2014someone opens the door she looks up rises to\nher feet\u2014\u201d\n\u201cAnd he struck her down\u201d finished the doctor.",
    "\u201cThe blow would\nproduce unconsciousness and death would follow very shortly.",
    "You see\n\u2014\u201d\nHe explained the injury in technical language.",
    "\u201cNot much blood then\u201d said Poirot.",
    "\u201cNo the blood escaped internally into the brain.\u201d\n\u201cEh bien\u201d said Poirot \u201cthat seems straightforward enough\u2014except\nfor one thing.",
    "If the man who entered was a stranger why did not\nMrs. Leidner cry out at once for help If she had screamed she would\nhave been heard.",
    "Nurse Leatheran here would have heard her and\nEmmott and the boy.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s easily answered\u201d said Dr. Reilly dryly.",
    "\u201cBecause it wasn\u2019t a\nstranger.\u201d\nPoirot nodded.",
    "\u201cYes\u201d he said meditatively.",
    "\u201cShe may have been surprised to see the\nperson\u2014but she was not afraid.",
    "Then as he struck she may have uttered\na half cry\u2014too late.\u201d\n\u201cThe cry Miss Johnson heard\u201d\n\u201cYes if she did hear it.",
    "But on the whole I doubt it.",
    "These mud walls\nare thick and the windows were closed.\u201d\nHe stepped up to the bed.",
    "\u201cYou left her actually lying down\u201d he asked me.",
    "I explained exactly what I had done.",
    "\u201cDid she mean to sleep or was she going to read\u201d\n\u201cI gave her two books\u2014a light one and a volume of memoirs.",
    "She\nusually read for a while and then sometimes dropped off for a short\n\n\fsleep.\u201d\n\u201cAnd she was\u2014what shall I say\u2014quite as usual\u201d\nI considered.",
    "\u201cYes.",
    "She seemed quite normal and in good spirits\u201d I said.",
    "\u201cJust a\nshade offhand perhaps but I put that down to her having confided in\nme the day before.",
    "It makes people a little uncomfortable sometimes.\u201d\nPoirot\u2019s eyes twinkled.",
    "\u201cAh yes indeed me I know that well.\u201d\nHe looked round the room.",
    "\u201cAnd when you came in here after the murder was everything as\nyou had seen it before\u201d\nI looked round also.",
    "\u201cYes I think so.",
    "I don\u2019t remember anything being different.\u201d\n\u201cThere was no sign of the weapon with which she was struck\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\nPoirot looked at Dr. Reilly.",
    "\u201cWhat was it in your opinion\u201d\nThe doctor replied promptly\n\u201cSomething pretty powerful of a fair size and without any sharp\ncorners or edges.",
    "The rounded base of a statue say\u2014something like that.",
    "Mind you I\u2019m not suggesting that that was it.",
    "But that type of thing.",
    "The\nblow was delivered with great force.\u201d\n\u201cStruck by a strong arm A man\u2019s arm\u201d\n\u201cYes\u2014unless\u2014\u201d\n\u201cUnless\u2014what\u201d\nDr. Reilly said slowly \u201cIt is just possible that Mrs. Leidner might\nhave been on her knees\u2014in which case the blow being delivered from\nabove with a heavy implement the force needed would not have been so\ngreat.\u201d\n\u201cOn her knees\u201d mused Poirot.",
    "\u201cIt is an idea\u2014that.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s only an idea mind\u201d the doctor hastened to point out.",
    "\u201cThere\u2019s\nabsolutely nothing to indicate it.\u201d\n\u201cBut it\u2019s possible.\u201d\n\u201cYes.",
    "And after all in view of the circumstances it\u2019s not fantastic.",
    "Her fear might have led her to kneel in supplication rather than to scream\n\n\fwhen her instinct would tell her it was too late\u2014that nobody could get\nthere in time.\u201d\n\u201cYes\u201d said Poirot thoughtfully.",
    "\u201cIt is an idea.",
    ". . .\u201d\nIt was a very poor one I thought.",
    "I couldn\u2019t for one moment imagine\nMrs. Leidner on her knees to anyone.",
    "Poirot made his way slowly round the room.",
    "He opened the\nwindows tested the bars passed his head through and satisfied himself\nthat by no means could his shoulders be made to follow his head.",
    "\u201cThe windows were shut when you found her\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cWere they\nalso shut when you left her at a quarter to one\u201d\n\u201cYes they were always shut in the afternoon.",
    "There is no gauze over\nthese windows as there is in the living room and dining room.",
    "They are\nkept shut to keep out the flies.\u201d\n\u201cAnd in any case no one could get in that way\u201d mused Poirot.",
    "\u201cAnd\nthe walls are of the most solid\u2014mudbrick\u2014and there are no trapdoors\nand no skylights.",
    "No there is only one way into this room\u2014through the\ndoor.",
    "And there is only one way to the door through the courtyard.",
    "And\nthere is only one entrance to the courtyard\u2014through the archway.",
    "And\noutside the archway there were five people and they all tell the same\nstory and I do not think me that they are lying .",

    "He took up a photograph\nfrom the chest of drawers.",
    "It was of an elderly man with a white goatee\nbeard.",
    "He looked inquiringly at me.",
    "\u201cMrs.",
    "Leidner\u2019s father\u201d I said.",
    "\u201cShe told me so.\u201d\nHe put it down again and glanced over the articles on the dressingtable\u2014all of plain tortoiseshell\u2014simple but good.",
    "He looked up at a row\nof books on a shelf repeating the titles aloud.",
    "\u201cWho were the Greeks Introduction to Relativity.",

    "Crewe Traine.",
    "Back to Methuselah.",

    "Yes they tell us something perhaps.",
    "She was not a fool your\nMrs. Leidner.",
    "She had a mind.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cOh she was a very clever woman\u201d I said eagerly.",
    "\u201cVery well read\nand up in everything.",
    "She wasn\u2019t a bit ordinary.\u201d\nHe smiled as he looked over at me.",
    "\u201cNo\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cI\u2019ve already realized that.\u201d\nHe passed on.",
    "He stood for some moments at the washstand where\nthere was a big array of bottles and toilet creams.",
    "Then suddenly he dropped on his knees and examined the rug.",
    "Dr. Reilly and I came quickly to join him.",
    "He was examining a small\ndark brown stain almost invisible on the brown of the rug.",
    "In fact it was\nonly just noticeable where it impinged on one of the white stripes.",
    "\u201cWhat do you say doctor\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cIs that blood\u201d\nDr. Reilly knelt down.",
    "\u201cMight be\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cI\u2019ll make sure if you like\u201d\n\u201cIf you would be so amiable.\u201d\nMr. Poirot examined the jug and basin.",
    "The jug was standing on the\nside of the washstand.",
    "The basin was empty but beside the washstand\nthere was an empty kerosene tin containing slop water.",
    "He turned to me.",
    "\u201cDo you remember nurse Was this jug out of the basin or in it\nwhen you left Mrs. Leidner at a quarter to one\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t be sure\u201d I said after a minute or two.",
    "\u201cI rather think it was\nstanding in the basin.\u201d\n\u201cAh\u201d\n\u201cBut you see\u201d I said hastily \u201cI only think so because it usually was.",
    "The boys leave it like that after lunch.",
    "I just feel that if it hadn\u2019t been in I\nshould have noticed it.\u201d\nHe nodded quite appreciatively.",
    "\u201cYes.",
    "I understand that.",
    "It is your hospital training.",
    "If everything had\nnot been just so in the room you would quite unconsciously have set it\nto rights hardly noticing what you were doing.",
    "And after the murder\nWas it like it is now\u201d\nI shook my head.",
    "\u201cI didn\u2019t notice then\u201d I said.",
    "\u201cAll I looked for was whether there\nwas any place anyone could be hidden or if there was anything the\nmurderer had left behind him.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cIt\u2019s blood all right\u201d said Dr. Reilly rising from his knees.",
    "\u201cIs it\nimportant\u201d\nPoirot was frowning perplexedly.",
    "He flung out his hands with\npetulance.",
    "\u201cI cannot tell.",
    "How can I tell It may mean nothing at all.",
    "I can say\nif I like that the murderer touched her\u2014that there was blood on his\nhands\u2014very little blood but still blood\u2014and so he came over here and\nwashed them.",
    "Yes it may have been like that.",
    "But I cannot jump to\nconclusions and say that it was so.",
    "That stain may be of no importance at\nall.\u201d\n\u201cThere would have been very little blood\u201d said Dr. Reilly dubiously.",
    "\u201cNone would have spurted out or anything like that.",

    "\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter nurse\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cNothing\u2014just gooseflesh\u201d I said.",

    "\u201cI couldn\u2019t think of such a thing.\u201d\nM. Poirot gave me a little friendly tap on the shoulder.",
    "Quite an\nEnglish tap not a foreign one.",
    "\u201cYou ma soeur will do as you are told\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cBesides it will be\nof advantage to me.",
    "There is a good deal more that I want to discuss and\nI cannot do it here where one must preserve the decencies.",
    "The good\nDr. Leidner he worshipped his wife and he is sure\u2014oh so sure\u2014that\neverybody else felt the same about her But that in my opinion would\n\n\fnot be human nature No we want to discuss Mrs. Leidner with\u2014how\ndo you say\u2014the gloves removed.",
    "That is settled then.",
    "When we have\nfinished here we take you with us to Hassanieh.\u201d\n\u201cI suppose\u201d I said doubtfully \u201cthat I ought to be leaving anyway.",

    ". . .\u201d\n\n\fEighteen\nTEA AT DR. REILLY\u2019S\n\nBefore leaving Poirot made a round of the expedition house and the\noutbuildings.",
    "He also asked a few questions of the servants at second\nhand\u2014that is to say Dr. Reilly translated the questions and answers from\nEnglish to Arabic and vice versa.",
    "These questions dealt mainly with the appearance of the stranger\nMrs. Leidner and I had seen looking through the window and to whom\nFather Lavigny had been talking on the following day.",
    "\u201cDo you really think that fellow had anything to do with it\u201d asked\nDr. Reilly when we were bumping along in his car on our way to\nHassanieh.",
    "\u201cI like all the information there is\u201d was Poirot\u2019s reply.",
    "And really that described his methods very well.",
    "I found later that\nthere wasn\u2019t anything\u2014no small scrap of insignificant gossip\u2014in which\nhe wasn\u2019t interested.",
    "Men aren\u2019t usually so gossipy.",

    "Let us discuss now\nquite simply which member of the expedition had the means and\nopportunity to kill Mrs.\nLeidner and who is likely to have done so.\u201d\n\u201cI thought you didn\u2019t think much of that theory.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cNot at all.",
    "But I have some natural delicacy\u201d said Poirot\nreproachfully.",
    "\u201cCan I discuss in the presence of Dr. Leidner the motives\nlikely to lead to the murder of his wife by a member of the expedition\nThat would not have been delicate at all.",
    "I had to sustain the fiction that\nhis wife was adorable and that everyone adored her\n\u201cBut naturally it was not like that at all.",
    "Now we can be brutal and\nimpersonal and say what we think.",
    "We have no longer to consider\npeople\u2019s feelings.",
    "And that is where Nurse Leatheran is going to help us.",
    "She is I am sure a very good observer.\u201d\n\u201cOh I don\u2019t know about that\u201d I said.",

    "But all the same I think\nFather Lavigny was puzzled by her and\u2014well\u2014almost annoyed by\nbeing puzzled if you know what I mean.\u201d\nAnd I told him of the conversation I had had with him out on the dig\nthat first day when he had called Mrs. Leidner a \u201cdangerous woman.\u201d\n\u201cNow that is very interesting\u201d M.

    "I quite understand.",

    "A very\nconvenient one.",

    "You never could tell what\nMr. Emmott was thinking.",
    "He was so quiet.",

    "A nice\ndependable person.",

    "Mr. Carey was in his shirt sleeves working over his big plan.",
    "Terribly ill he looked I thought.",
    "So strained and worn.",
    "It gave me\nquite a pang.",
    "I don\u2019t know what there was about Mr. Carey\u2014it wasn\u2019t\nwhat he said because he hardly said anything\u2014and that of the most\nordinary nature and it wasn\u2019t what he did for that didn\u2019t amount to\nmuch either\u2014and yet you just couldn\u2019t help noticing him and\n\n\feverything about him seemed to matter more than it would have about\nanyone else.",
    "He just counted if you know what I mean.",
    "He turned his head and saw me.",
    "He removed his pipe from his\nmouth and said \u201cWell nurse back from Hassanieh\u201d\n\u201cYes Mr. Carey.",

    "\u201cWell of course you\u2019re right in a way\u201d I said.",
    "\u201cIt takes one\u2019s mind\noff if one\u2019s got something to do.\u201d\nThe funeral I knew was to be the day after tomorrow.",

    "In the end however a sort of uneasiness drove me on.",
    "After all it couldn\u2019t do any harm.",

    "A nice strong cup of tea and a\nhotwater bottle in your bed is what you want\u201d I said.",

    "The strain and the shock and the police here\nthere and everywhere.",
    "Why I\u2019m quite jumpy myself.\u201d\nShe said slowly in rather a queer voice \u201cWhat you said in there is\ntrue.",
    "What\u2019s happened has happened and can\u2019t be mended.",
    ". . .\u201d\nShe was silent for a minute or two and then said\u2014rather oddly I\nthought \u201cShe was never a nice woman\u201d\nWell I didn\u2019t argue the point.",
    "I\u2019d always felt it was quite natural for\nMiss Johnson and Mrs. Leidner not to hit it off.",
    "I wondered if perhaps Miss Johnson had secretly had a feeling that\nshe was pleased Mrs. Leidner was dead and had then been ashamed of\nherself for the thought.",
    "I said \u201cNow you go to sleep and don\u2019t worry about anything.\u201d\nI just picked up a few things and set the room to rights.",
    "Stockings\nover the back of the chair and coat and skirt on a hanger.",
    "There was a\nlittle ball of crumpled paper on the floor where it must have fallen out of\na pocket.",
    "I was just smoothing it out to see whether I could safely throw it\naway when she quite startled me.",
    "\u201cGive that to me\u201d\nI did so\u2014rather taken aback.",
    "She\u2019d called out so peremptorily.",
    "She\nsnatched it from me\u2014fairly snatched it\u2014and then held it in the candle\nflame till it was burnt to ashes.",
    "As I say I was startled\u2014and I just stared at her.",
    "I hadn\u2019t had time to see what the paper was\u2014she\u2019d snatched it so\nquick.",
    "But funnily enough as it burned it curled over towards me and I\njust saw that there were words written in ink on the paper.",
    "It wasn\u2019t till I was getting into bed that I realized why they\u2019d looked\nsort of familiar to me.",
    "It was the same handwriting as that of the anonymous letters.",
    "Was that why Miss Johnson had given way to a fit of remorse Had\nit been her all along who had written those anonymous letters\n\n\fTwenty\nMISS JOHNSON\nMRS. MERCADO MR. REITER\n\nI don\u2019t mind confessing that the idea came as a complete shock to me.",
    "I\u2019d never thought of associating Miss Johnson with the letters.",
    "Mrs. Mercado perhaps.",
    "But Miss Johnson was a real lady and so selfcontrolled and sensible.",
    "But I reflected remembering the conversation I had listened to that\nevening between M. Poirot and Dr. Reilly that that might be just why.",
    "If it were Miss Johnson who had written the letters it explained a lot\nmind you.",
    "I didn\u2019t think for a minute Miss Johnson had had anything to\ndo with the murder.",
    "But I did see that her dislike of Mrs. Leidner might\nhave made her succumb to the temptation of well\u2014putting the wind up\nher\u2014to put it vulgarly.",
    "She might have hoped to frighten away Mrs. Leidner from the dig.",
    "But then Mrs. Leidner had been murdered and Miss Johnson had felt\nterrible pangs of remorse\u2014first for her cruel trick and also perhaps\nbecause she realized that those letters were acting as a very good shield\nto the actual murderer.",
    "No wonder she had broken down so utterly.",
    "She\nwas I was sure a decent soul at heart.",
    "And it explained too why she\nhad caught so eagerly at my consolation of \u201cwhat\u2019s happened\u2019s happened\nand can\u2019t be mended.\u201d\nAnd then her cryptic remark\u2014her vindication of herself\u2014\u201cshe was\nnever a nice woman\u201d\nThe question was what was I to do about it\nI tossed and turned for a good while and in the end decided I\u2019d let\nM. Poirot know about it at the first opportunity.",
    "He came out next day but I didn\u2019t get a chance of speaking to him\nwhat you might call privately.",
    "We had just a minute alone together and before I could collect\nmyself to know how to begin he had come close to me and was\nwhispering instructions in my ear.",
    "\u201cMe I shall talk to Miss Johnson\u2014and others perhaps in the living\nroom.",
    "You have the key of Mrs. Leidner\u2019s room still\u201d\n\u201cYes\u201d I said.",
    "\u201cTr\u00e8s bien.",
    "Go there shut the door behind you and give a cry\u2014not a\nscream\u2014a cry.",
    "You understand what I mean\u2014it is alarm\u2014surprise that I\nwant you to express\u2014not mad terror.",
    "As for the excuse if you are heard\n\u2014I leave that to you\u2014the stepped toe or what you will.\u201d\nAt that moment Miss Johnson came out into the courtyard and there\nwas no time for more.",
    "I understood well enough what M. Poirot was after.",
    "As soon as he\nand Miss Johnson had gone into the living room I went across to\nMrs. Leidner\u2019s room and unlocking the door went in and pulled the\ndoor to behind me.",
    "I can\u2019t say I didn\u2019t feel a bit of a fool standing up in an empty room\nand giving a yelp all for nothing at all.",
    "Besides it wasn\u2019t so easy to know\njust how loud to do it.",
    "I gave a pretty loud \u201cOh\u201d and then tried it a bit\nhigher and a bit lower.",
    "Then I came out again and prepared my excuse of a stepped stubbed\nI suppose he meant toe.",
    "But it soon appeared that no excuse would be needed.",
    "Poirot and\nMiss Johnson were talking together earnestly and there had clearly been\nno interruption.",
    "\u201cWell\u201d I thought \u201cthat settles that.",
    "Either Miss Johnson imagined\nthat cry she heard or else it was something quite different.\u201d\nI didn\u2019t like to go in and interrupt them.",
    "There was a deck chair on\nthe porch so I sat down there.",
    "Their voices floated out to me.",
    "\u201cThe position is delicate you understand\u201d Poirot was saying.",
    "\u201cDr.",
    "Leidner\u2014obviously he adored his wife\u2014\u201d\n\u201cHe worshipped her\u201d said Miss Johnson.",
    "\u201cHe tells me naturally how fond all his staff was of her As for\nthem what can they say Naturally they say the same thing.",
    "It is\npoliteness.",
    "It is decency.",
    "It may also be the truth But also it may not\n\n\fAnd I am convinced mademoiselle that the key to this enigma lies in a\ncomplete understanding of Mrs. Leidner\u2019s character.",
    "If I could get the\nopinion\u2014the honest opinion\u2014of every member of the staff I might\nfrom the whole build up a picture.",
    "Frankly that is why I am here today.",
    "I\nknew Dr. Leidner would be in Hassanieh.",
    "That makes it easy for me to\nhave an interview with each of you here in turn and beg your help.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s all very well\u201d began Miss Johnson and stopped.",
    "\u201cDo not make me the British clich\u00e9s\u201d Poirot begged.",
    "\u201cDo not say it\nis not the cricket or the football that to speak anything but well of the\ndead is not done\u2014that\u2014enfin\u2014there is loyalty Loyalty it is a\npestilential thing in crime.",
    "Again and again it obscures the truth.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve no particular loyalty to Mrs. Leidner\u201d said Miss Johnson\ndryly.",
    "There was indeed a sharp and acid tone in her voice.",
    "\u201cDr.",
    "Leidner\u2019s a different matter.",
    "And after all she was his wife.\u201d\n\u201cPrecisely\u2014precisely.",
    "I understand that you would not wish to speak\nagainst your chief\u2019s wife.",
    "But this is not a question of a testimonial.",
    "It is\na question of sudden and mysterious death.",
    "If I am to believe that it is a\nmartyred angel who has been killed it does not add to the easiness of my\ntask.\u201d\n\u201cI certainly shouldn\u2019t call her an angel\u201d said Miss Johnson and the\nacid tone was even more in evidence.",
    "\u201cTell me your opinion frankly of Mrs. Leidner\u2014as a woman.\u201d\n\u201cH\u2019m To begin with M. Poirot I\u2019ll give you this warning.",
    "I\u2019m\nprejudiced.",
    "I am\u2014we all were\u2014devoted to Dr. Leidner.",
    "And I suppose\nwhen Mrs. Leidner came along we were jealous.",
    "We resented the\ndemands she made on his time and attention.",
    "The devotion he showed\nher irritated us.",
    "I\u2019m being truthful M. Poirot and it isn\u2019t very pleasant\nfor me.",
    "I resented her presence here\u2014yes I did though of course I tried\nnever to show it.",
    "It made a difference to us you see.\u201d\n\u201cUs You say us\u201d\n\u201cI mean Mr. Carey and myself.",
    "We\u2019re the two oldtimers you see.",
    "And we didn\u2019t much care for the new order of things.",
    "I suppose that\u2019s\nnatural though perhaps it was rather petty of us.",
    "But it did make a\ndifference.\u201d\n\u201cWhat kind of a difference\u201d\n\n\f\u201cOh to everything.",
    "We used to have such a happy time.",
    "A good deal\nof fun you know and rather silly jokes like people do who work\ntogether.",
    "Dr. Leidner was quite lighthearted\u2014just like a boy.\u201d\n\u201cAnd when Mrs. Leidner came she changed all that\u201d\n\u201cWell I suppose it wasn\u2019t her fault.",
    "It wasn\u2019t so bad last year.",
    "And\nplease believe M. Poirot that it wasn\u2019t anything she did.",
    "She\u2019s always\nbeen charming to me\u2014quite charming.",
    "That\u2019s why I\u2019ve felt ashamed\nsometimes.",
    "It wasn\u2019t her fault that little things she said and did seemed to\nrub me up the wrong way.",
    "Really nobody could be nicer than she was.\u201d\n\u201cBut nevertheless things were changed this season There was a\ndifferent atmosphere.\u201d\n\u201cOh entirely.",
    "Really.",
    "I don\u2019t know what it was.",

    "All on edge.",

    "Conservative\u2014\nliking things always the same.",
    "You really mustn\u2019t take any notice of me\nM. Poirot.\u201d\n\u201cHow would you describe to me Mrs. Leidner\u2019s character and\ntemperament\u201d\nMiss Johnson hesitated for a moment.",
    "Then she said slowly \u201cWell\nof course she was temperamental.",
    "A lot of ups and downs.",
    "Nice to\npeople one day and perhaps wouldn\u2019t speak to them the next.",
    "She was\nvery kind I think.",
    "And very thoughtful for others.",
    "All the same you\ncould see she had been thoroughly spoilt all her life.",
    "She took\nDr. Leidner\u2019s waiting on her hand and foot as perfectly natural.",
    "And I\ndon\u2019t think she ever really appreciated what a very remarkable\u2014what a\nreally great\u2014man she had married.",
    "That used to annoy me sometimes.",
    "And of course she was terribly highly strung and nervous.",
    "The things she\nused to imagine and the states she used to get into I was thankful when\nDr. Leidner brought Nurse Leatheran here.",
    "It was too much for him\nhaving to cope both with his work and with his wife\u2019s fears.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cWhat is your own opinion of these anonymous letters she\nreceived\u201d\nI had to do it.",

    "\u201cYou make me blush mademoiselle\u201d he said.",

    "But what will you I am interested always in the love affairs\nof young people.\u201d\n\u201cYes\u201d said Miss Johnson with a little sigh.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s nice when the\ncourse of true love runs smooth.\u201d\nPoirot gave an answering sigh.",
    "I wondered if Miss Johnson was\nthinking of some love affair of her own when she was a girl.",
    "And I\nwondered if M. Poirot had a wife and if he went on in the way you\nalways hear foreigners do with mistresses and things like that.",
    "He\nlooked so comic I couldn\u2019t imagine it.",
    "\u201cSheila Reilly has a lot of character\u201d said Miss Johnson.",

    "\u201cAnd you\u2019ll come back to lunch won\u2019t you M. Poirot\u201d\n\u201cEnchanted mademoiselle.\u201d\nMiss Johnson went back into the living room where she was\nengaged in cataloguing.",

    "Mercado\u2019s on the roof\u201d I said.",
    "\u201cDo you want to see her first\u201d\n\u201cIt would be as well I think.",
    "Let us go up.\u201d\nAs we went up the stairs I said \u201cI did what you told me.",
    "Did you\nhear anything\u201d\n\u201cNot a sound.\u201d\n\u201cThat will be a weight off Miss Johnson\u2019s mind at any rate\u201d I said.",

    "Then she looked up with a start.",
    "She looked ill this morning I thought her small face pinched and\nwizened and great dark circles under her eyes.",
    "\u201cEncore moi\u201d said Poirot.",
    "\u201cI come today with a special object.\u201d\nAnd he went on much in the same way as he had done to\nMiss Johnson explaining how necessary it was that he should get a true\npicture of Mrs. Leidner.",
    "Mrs. Mercado however wasn\u2019t as honest as Miss Johnson had been.",
    "She burst into fulsome praise which I was pretty sure was quite far\nremoved from her real feelings.",

    "\u201cIt was interesting that.",
    "For she let out the fact\nshe knew all about those letters.",
    "So far they have not been spoken of in\nthe presence of the staff.",
    "Of course it is quite possible that Dr. Leidner\ntold her about them yesterday.",
    "They are old friends he and she.",
    "But if he\ndid not\u2014well\u2014then it is curious and interesting is it not\u201d\nMy respect for him went up.",
    "It was clever the way he had tricked her\ninto mentioning the letters.",

    "We had just reached the dig.",

    "It\u2019s my opinion that the men who were digging just hacked out walls\nwherever they wanted them.",
    "That\u2019s what it looked like anyway.",
    "Mr. Carey explained to me that you could feel the difference at once with\na pick and he tried to show me\u2014but I never saw.",
    "When the man said\n\u201cLibn\u201d\u2014mudbrick\u2014it was just ordinary dirt and mud as far as I could\nsee.",
    "Mr. Reiter finished his photographs and handed over the camera and\nthe plate to his boy and told him to take them back to the house.",
    "Poirot asked him one or two questions about exposures and film\npacks and so on which he answered very readily.",
    "He seemed pleased to\nbe asked about his work.",
    "He was just tendering his excuses for leaving us when Poirot\nplunged once more into his set speech.",
    "As a matter of fact it wasn\u2019t quite\na set speech because he varied it a little each time to suit the person he\nwas talking to.",
    "But I\u2019m not going to write it all down every time.",
    "With\nsensible people like Miss Johnson he went straight to the point and with\nsome of the others he had to beat about the bush a bit more.",
    "But it came\nto the same in the end.",
    "\u201cYes yes I see what you mean\u201d said Mr. Reiter.",
    "\u201cBut indeed I do\nnot see that I can be much help to you.",
    "I am new here this season and I\ndid not speak much with Mrs. Leidner.",
    "I regret but indeed I can tell you\nnothing.\u201d\nThere was something a little stiff and foreign in the way he spoke\nthough of course he hadn\u2019t got any accent\u2014except an American one I\nmean.",
    "\u201cYou can at least tell me whether you liked or disliked her\u201d said\nPoirot with a smile.",

    "And intellectual.",
    "She had a very fine brain\u2014yes.\u201d\n\u201cBien You liked her.",
    "And she liked you\u201d\nMr. Reiter got redder still.",
    "\u201cOh I\u2014I don\u2019t know that she noticed me much.",

    "There was a little\u2014stiffness.\u201d\nHe paused struggling with himself and then said \u201cYou see I am\nnot very good in company.",
    "I am clumsy.",
    "I am shy.",
    "Dr. Leidner always he\nhas been most kind to me.",
    "But\u2014it is stupid\u2014I cannot overcome my\nshyness.",
    "I say always the wrong thing.",
    "I upset water jugs.",
    "I am unlucky.\u201d\nHe really looked like a large awkward child.",
    "\u201cWe all do these things when we are young\u201d said Poirot smiling.",
    "\u201cThe poise the savoir faire it comes later.\u201d\nThen with a word of farewell we walked on.",
    "He said \u201cThat ma soeur is either an extremely simple young man\nor a very remarkable actor.\u201d\nI didn\u2019t answer.",
    "I was caught up once more by the fantastic notion\nthat one of these people was a dangerous and coldblooded murderer.",
    "Somehow on this beautiful still sunny morning it seemed impossible.",
    "Twentyone\nMR. MERCADO RICHARD CAREY\n\n\u201c\nThey work in two separate places I see\u201d said Poirot halting.",
    "Mr. Reiter had been doing his photography on an outlying portion of\nthe main excavation.",
    "A little distance away from us a second swarm of\nmen were coming and going with baskets.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s what they call the deep cut\u201d I explained.",
    "\u201cThey don\u2019t find\nmuch there nothing but rubbishy broken pottery but Dr. Leidner always\nsays it\u2019s very interesting so I suppose it must be.\u201d\n\u201cLet us go there.\u201d\nWe walked together slowly for the sun was hot.",
    "Mr. Mercado was in command.",
    "We saw him below us talking to the\nforeman an old man like a tortoise who wore a tweed coat over his long\nstriped cotton gown.",
    "It was a little difficult to get down to them as there was only a\nnarrow path or stair and basketboys were going up and down it\nconstantly and they always seemed to be as blind as bats and never to\nthink of getting out of the way.",
    "As I followed Poirot down he said suddenly over his shoulder \u201cIs\nMr. Mercado righthanded or lefthanded\u201d\nNow that was an extraordinary question if you like\nI thought a minute then \u201cRighthanded\u201d I said decisively.",
    "Poirot didn\u2019t condescend to explain.",
    "He just went on and I followed\nhim.",
    "Mr. Mercado seemed rather pleased to see us.",
    "His long melancholy face lit up.",
    "M. Poirot pretended to an interest in archaeology that I\u2019m sure he\ncouldn\u2019t have really felt but Mr. Mercado responded at once.",
    "He explained that they had already cut down through twelve levels\nof house occupation.",
    "\u201cWe are now definitely in the fourth millennium\u201d he said with\nenthusiasm.",
    "I always thought a millennium was in the future\u2014the time when\neverything comes right.",
    "Mr. Mercado pointed out belts of ashes how his hand did shake I\nwondered if he might possibly have malaria and he explained how the\npottery changed in character and about burials\u2014and how they had had\none level almost entirely composed of infant burials\u2014poor little things\n\u2014and about flexed position and orientation which seemed to mean the\nway the bones were lying.",
    "And then suddenly just as he was stooping down to pick up a kind\nof flint knife that was lying with some pots in a corner he leapt into the\nair with a wild yell.",
    "He spun round to find me and Poirot staring at him in astonishment.",
    "He clapped his hand to his left arm.",
    "\u201cSomething stung me\u2014like a redhot needle.\u201d\nImmediately Poirot was galvanized into energy.",
    "\u201cQuick mon cher let us see.",
    "Nurse Leatheran\u201d\nI came forward.",
    "He seized Mr. Mercado\u2019s arm and deftly rolled back the sleeve of his\nkhaki shirt to the shoulder.",
    "\u201cThere\u201d said Mr. Mercado pointing.",
    "About three inches below the shoulder there was a minute prick\nfrom which the blood was oozing.",
    "\u201cCurious\u201d said Poirot.",
    "He peered into the rolledup sleeve.",
    "\u201cI can\nsee nothing.",
    "It was an ant perhaps\u201d\n\u201cBetter put on a little iodine\u201d I said.",
    "I always carry an iodine pencil with me and I whipped it out and\napplied it.",
    "But I was a little absentminded as I did so for my attention\nhad been caught by something quite different.",
    "Mr. Mercado\u2019s arm all the\n\n\fway up the forearm to the elbow was marked all over by tiny punctures.",
    "I knew well enough what they were\u2014the marks of a hypodermic needle.",
    "Mr. Mercado rolled down his sleeve again and recommenced his\nexplanations.",
    "Mr. Poirot listened but didn\u2019t try to bring the conversation\nround to the Leidners.",
    "In fact he didn\u2019t ask Mr. Mercado anything at all.",
    "Presently we said goodbye to Mr. Mercado and climbed up the path\nagain.",
    "\u201cIt was neat that did you not think so\u201d my companion asked.",
    "\u201cNeat\u201d I asked.",
    "M. Poirot took something from behind the lapel of his coat and\nsurveyed it affectionately.",
    "To my surprise I saw that it was a long sharp\ndarning needle with a blob of sealing wax making it into a pin.",
    "\u201cM.",
    "Poirot\u201d I cried \u201cdid you do that\u201d\n\u201cI was the stinging insect\u2014yes.",
    "And very neatly I did it too do you\nnot think so You did not see me.\u201d\nThat was true enough.",
    "I never saw him do it.",
    "And I\u2019m sure\nMr. Mercado hadn\u2019t suspected.",
    "He must have been quick as lightning.",
    "\u201cBut M. Poirot why\u201d I asked.",
    "He answered me by another question.",
    "\u201cDid you notice anything sister\u201d he asked.",
    "I nodded my head slowly.",
    "\u201cHypodermic marks\u201d I said.",
    "\u201cSo now we know something about Mr. Mercado\u201d said Poirot.",
    "\u201cI\nsuspected\u2014but I did not know.",
    "It is always necessary to know.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you don\u2019t care how you set about it\u201d I thought but didn\u2019t say.",
    "Poirot suddenly clapped his hand to his pocket.",
    "\u201cAlas I have dropped my handkerchief down there.",
    "I concealed the\npin in it.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll get it for you\u201d I said and hurried back.",
    "I\u2019d got the feeling you see by this time that M. Poirot and I were\nthe doctor and nurse in charge of a case.",
    "At least it was more like an\noperation and he was the surgeon.",
    "Perhaps I oughtn\u2019t to say so but in a\nqueer way I was beginning to enjoy myself.",
    "I remember just after I\u2019d finished my training I went to a case in\naprivate house and the need for an immediate operation arose and the\n\n\fpatient\u2019s husband was cranky about nursing homes.",
    "He just wouldn\u2019t\nhear of his wife being taken to one.",
    "Said it had to be done in the house.",
    "Well of course it was just splendid for me Nobody else to have a\nlook in I was in charge of everything.",
    "Of course I was terribly nervous\n\u2014I thought of everything conceivable that doctor could want but even\nthen I was afraid I might have forgotten something.",
    "You never know\nwith doctors.",
    "They ask for absolutely anything sometimes But\neverything went splendidly I had each thing ready as he asked for it and\nhe actually told me I\u2019d done firstrate after it was over\u2014and that\u2019s a\nthing most doctors wouldn\u2019t bother to do The G.P.",
    "was very nice too.",
    "And I ran the whole thing myself\nThe patient recovered too so everybody was happy.",
    "Well I felt rather the same now.",
    "In a way M. Poirot reminded me of\nthat surgeon.",
    "He was a little man too.",
    "Ugly little manwith a face like a\nmonkey but a wonderful surgeon.",
    "He knew instinctively just where to\ngo.",
    "I\u2019ve seen a lot of surgeons and I know what a lot of difference there\nis.",
    "Gradually I\u2019d been growing a kind of confidence in M. Poirot.",
    "I felt\nthat he too knew exactly what he was doing.",
    "And I was getting to feel\nthat it was my job to help him\u2014as you might say\u2014to have the forceps\nand the swabs and all handy just when he wanted them.",
    "That\u2019s why it\nseemed just as natural for me to run off and look for his handkerchief as\nit would have been to pick up a towel that a doctor had thrown on the\nfloor.",
    "When I\u2019d found it and got back I couldn\u2019t see him at first.",
    "But at last\nI caught sight of him.",
    "He was sitting a little way from the mound talking\nto Mr. Carey.",
    "Mr. Carey\u2019s boy was standing near with that great big rod\nthing with metres marked on it but just at that moment he said\nsomething to the boy and the boy took it away.",
    "It seemed he had finished\nwith it for the time being.",
    "I\u2019d like to get this next bit quite clear.",
    "You see I wasn\u2019t quite sure\nwhat M. Poirot did or didn\u2019t want me to do.",
    "He might I mean have sent\nme back for that handkerchief on purpose.",
    "To get me out of the way.",
    "It was just like an operation over again.",
    "You\u2019ve got to be careful to\nhand the doctor just what he wants and not what he doesn\u2019t want.",
    "I mean\n\n\fsuppose you gave him the artery forceps at the wrong moment and were\nlate with them at the right moment Thank goodness I know my work in\nthe theatre well enough.",
    "I\u2019m not likely to make mistakes there.",
    "But in\nthis business I was really the rawest of raw little probationers.",
    "And so I\nhad to be particularly careful not to make any silly mistakes.",
    "Of course I didn\u2019t for one moment imagine that M. Poirot didn\u2019t\nwant me to hear what he and Mr. Carey were saying.",
    "But he might have\nthought he\u2019d get Mr. Carey to talk better if I wasn\u2019t there.",
    "Now I don\u2019t want anybody to get it into their heads that I\u2019m the kind\nof woman who goes about eavesdropping on private conversations.",
    "I\nwouldn\u2019t do such a thing.",
    "Not for a moment.",
    "Not however much I\nwanted to.",
    "And what I mean is if it had been a private conversation I wouldn\u2019t\nfor a moment have done what as a matter of fact I actually did do.",
    "As I looked at it I was in a privileged position.",
    "After all you hear\nmany a thing when a patient\u2019s coming round after an anaesthetic.",
    "The\npatient wouldn\u2019t want you to hear it\u2014and usually has no idea you have\nheard it\u2014but the fact remains you do hear it.",
    "I just took it that Mr. Carey\nwas the patient.",
    "He\u2019d be none the worse for what he didn\u2019t know about.",
    "And if you think that I was just curious well I\u2019ll admit that I was\ncurious.",
    "I didn\u2019t want to miss anything I could help.",
    "All this is just leading up to the fact that I turned aside and went by a\nroundabout way up behind the big dump until I was a foot from where\nthey were but concealed from them by the corner of the dump.",
    "And if\nanyone says it was dishonourable I just beg to disagree.",
    "Nothing ought to\nbe hidden from the nurse in charge of the case though of course it\u2019s for\nthe doctor to say what shall be done.",
    "I don\u2019t know of course what M. Poirot\u2019s line of approach had been\nbut by the time I\u2019d got there he was aiming straight for the bull\u2019s eye so\nto speak.",
    "\u201cNobody appreciates Dr. Leidner\u2019s devotion to his wife more than I\ndo\u201d he was saying.",
    "\u201cBut it is often the case that one learns more about a\nperson from their enemies than from their friends.\u201d\n\u201cYou suggest that their faults are more important than their virtues\u201d\nsaid Mr. Carey.",
    "His tone was dry and ironic.",
    "\u201cUndoubtedly\u2014when it comes to murder.",
    "It seems odd that as far as\nI know nobody has yet been murdered for having too perfect a character\nAnd yet perfection is undoubtedly an irritating thing.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019m hardly the right person to help you\u201d said Mr. Carey.",
    "\u201cTo be perfectly honest Mrs. Leidner and I didn\u2019t hit it off particularly\nwell.",
    "I don\u2019t mean that we were in any sense of the word enemies but\nwe were not exactly friends.",
    "Mrs. Leidner was perhaps a shade jealous\nof my old friendship with her husband.",
    "I for my part although I admired\nher very much and thought she was an extremely attractive woman was\njust a shade resentful of her influence over Leidner.",
    "As a result we were\nquite polite to each other but not intimate.\u201d\n\u201cAdmirably explained\u201d said Poirot.",
    "I could just see their heads and I saw Mr. Carey\u2019s turn sharply as\nthough something in M. Poirot\u2019s detached tone struck him disagreeably.",
    "M. Poirot went on \u201cWas not Dr. Leidner distressed that you and his\nwife did not get on together better\u201d\nCarey hesitated a minute before saying \u201cReally\u2014I\u2019m not sure.",
    "He\nnever said anything.",

    "He was very\nwrapped up in his work you know.\u201d\n\u201cSo the truth according to you is that you did not really like\nMrs. Leidner\u201d\nCarey shrugged his shoulders.",
    "\u201cI should probably have liked her very much if she hadn\u2019t been\nLeidner\u2019s wife.\u201d\nHe laughed as though amused by his own statement.",
    "Poirot was arranging a little heap of broken potsherds.",
    "He said in a\ndreamy faraway voice \u201cI talked to Miss Johnson this morning.",
    "She\nadmitted that she was prejudiced against Mrs. Leidner and did not like\nher very much although she hastened to add that Mrs. Leidner had\nalways been charming to her.\u201d\n\u201cAll quite true I should say\u201d said Carey.",
    "\u201cSo I believed.",
    "Then I had a conversation with Mrs. Mercado.",
    "She\ntold me at great length how devoted she had been to Mrs. Leidner and\nhow much she had admired her.\u201d\n\n\fCarey made no answer to this and after waiting a minute or two\nPoirot went on \u201cThat\u2014I did not believe Then I come to you and that\nwhich you tell me\u2014well again\u2014I do not believe.",

    "You\u2019ve heard the truth and you can take it or leave it as far as I am\nconcerned.\u201d\nPoirot did not grow angry.",
    "Instead he sounded particularly meek and\ndepressed.",
    "\u201cIs it my fault what I do\u2014or do not believe I have a sensitive ear\nyou know.",
    "And then\u2014there are always plenty of stories going about\u2014\nrumours floating in the air.",

    "\u201cWhat stories\u201d he asked savagely.",

    "Poirot sat looking after him and presently he murmured \u201cYes\u2014I\nsee.",
    ". . .\u201d\nWithout turning his head he said in a slightly louder voice \u201cDo not\ncome round the corner for a minute nurse.",
    "In case he turns his head.",
    "Now it is all right.",
    "You have my handkerchief Many thanks.",
    "You are\nmost amiable.\u201d\nHe didn\u2019t say anything at all about my having been listening\u2014and\nhow he knew I was listening I can\u2019t think.",
    "He\u2019d never once looked in\nthat direction.",
    "I was rather relieved he didn\u2019t say anything.",
    "I mean I felt\nall right with myself about it but it might have been a little awkward\nexplaining to him.",
    "So it was a good thing he didn\u2019t seem to want\nexplanations.",
    "\u201cDo you think he did hate her M. Poirot\u201d I asked.",
    "Nodding his head slowly with a curious expression on his face\nPoirot answered.",
    "\u201cYes\u2014I think he did.\u201d\nThen he got up briskly and began to walk to where the men were\nworking on the top of the mound.",
    "I followed him.",
    "We couldn\u2019t see\nanyone but Arabs at first but we finally found Mr. Emmott lying face\ndownwards blowing dust off a skeleton that had just been uncovered.",
    "He gave his pleasant grave smile when he saw us.",
    "\u201cHave you come to see round\u201d he asked.",
    "\u201cI\u2019ll be free in a minute.\u201d\nHe sat up took his knife and began daintily cutting the earth away\nfrom round the bones stopping every now and then to use either a\n\n\fbellows or his own breath.",
    "A very insanitary proceeding the latter I\nthought.",
    "\u201cYou\u2019ll get all sorts of nasty germs in your mouth Mr. Emmott\u201d I\nprotested.",

    "\u201cThere\u201d he said rising to his feet.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s ready for Reiter to\nphotograph after lunch.",
    "Rather nice stuff she had in with her.\u201d\nHe showed us a little verdigris copper bowl and some pins.",

    "The bones and all the objects were brushed and cleaned with a knife\nand kept in position ready to be photographed.",

    "\u201cFirst millennium.",
    "A lady of some consequence perhaps.",
    "Skull looks\nrather odd\u2014I must get Mercado to look at it.",
    "It suggests death by foul\nplay.\u201d\n\u201cA Mrs. Leidner of two thousand odd years ago\u201d said Poirot.",
    "\u201cPerhaps\u201d said Mr. Emmott.",
    "Bill Coleman was doing something with a pick to a wall face.",
    "David Emmott called something to him which I didn\u2019t catch and\nthen started showing M. Poirot round.",

    "\u201cShall we walk back to the\nhouse\u201d\n\u201cThat will suit me excellently\u201d said Poirot.",
    "We walked slowly along the wellworn path.",
    "\u201cI expect you are all glad to get back to work again\u201d said Poirot.",
    "Emmott replied gravely \u201cYes it\u2019s much the best thing.",
    "It\u2019s not been\nany too easy loafing about the house and making conversation.\u201d\n\u201cKnowing all the time that one of you was a murderer.\u201d\n\n\fEmmott did not answer.",
    "He made no gesture of dissent.",

    "I want to know about Mrs. Leidner.\u201d\nDavid Emmott said slowly \u201cWhat do you mean by know about\nher\u201d\n\u201cI do not mean where she came from and what her maiden name\nwas.",
    "I do not mean the shape of her face and the colour of her eyes.",
    "I\nmean her\u2014herself.\u201d\n\u201cYou think that counts in the case\u201d\n\u201cI am quite sure of it.\u201d\nEmmott was silent for a moment or two then he said \u201cMaybe\nyou\u2019re right.\u201d\n\u201cAnd that is where you can help me.",
    "You can tell me what sort of a\nwoman she was.\u201d\n\u201cCan I I\u2019ve often wondered about it myself.\u201d\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you make up your mind on the subject\u201d\n\u201cI think I did in the end.\u201d\n\u201cEh bien\u201d\nBut Mr. Emmott was silent for some minutes then he said \u201cWhat\ndid nurse think of her Women are said to sum up other women quickly\nenough and a nurse has a wide experience of types.\u201d\nPoirot didn\u2019t give me any chance of speaking even if I had wanted\nto.",
    "He said quickly \u201cWhat I want to know is what a man thought of\nher\u201d\nEmmott smiled a little.",
    "\u201cI expect they\u2019d all be much the same.\u201d He paused and said \u201cShe\nwasn\u2019t young but I think she was about the most beautiful woman I\u2019ve\never come across.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s hardly an answer Mr. Emmott.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cIt\u2019s not so far off one M. Poirot.\u201d\nHe was silent a minute or two and then he went on \u201cThere used to\nbe a fairy story I read when I was a kid.",
    "A Northern fairy tale about the\nSnow Queen and Little Kay.",
    "I guess Mrs. Leidner was rather like that\u2014\nalways taking Little Kay for a ride.\u201d\n\u201cAh yes a tale of Hans Andersen is it not And there was a girl in\nit.",
    "Little Gerda was that her name\u201d\n\u201cMaybe.",
    "I don\u2019t remember much of it.\u201d\n\u201cCan\u2019t you go a little further Mr. Emmott\u201d\nDavid Emmott shook his head.",
    "\u201cI don\u2019t even know if I\u2019ve summed her up correctly.",
    "She wasn\u2019t easy\nto read.",
    "She\u2019d do a devilish thing one day and a really fine one the next.",
    "But I think you\u2019re about right when you say that she\u2019s the hub of the\ncase.",
    "That\u2019s what she always wanted to be\u2014at the centre of things.",
    "And\nshe liked to get at other people\u2014I mean she wasn\u2019t just satisfied with\nbeing passed the toast and the peanut butter she wanted you to turn your\nmind and soul inside out for her to look at it.\u201d\n\u201cAnd if one did not give her that satisfaction\u201d asked Poirot.",
    "\u201cThen she could turn ugly\u201d\nI saw his lips close resolutely and his jaw set.",
    "\u201cI suppose Mr. Emmott you would not care to express a plain\nunofficial opinion as to who murdered her\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d said Emmott.",
    "\u201cI really haven\u2019t the slightest idea.",
    "I\nrather think that if I\u2019d been Carl\u2014Carl Reiter I mean\u2014I would have\nhad a shot at murdering her.",
    "She was a pretty fair devil to him.",
    "But of\ncourse he asks for it by being so darned sensitive.",
    "Just invites you to\ngive him a kick in the pants.\u201d\n\u201cAnd did Mrs. Leidner give him\u2014a kick in the pants\u201d inquired\nPoirot.",
    "Emmott gave a sudden grin.",
    "\u201cNo.",
    "Pretty little jabs with an embroidery needle\u2014that was her\nmethod.",
    "He was irritating of course.",
    "Just like some blubbering poorspirited kid.",
    "But a needle\u2019s a painful weapon.\u201d\nI stole a glance at Poirot and thought I detected a slight quiver of his\nlips.",
    "\u201cBut you don\u2019t really believe that Carl Reiter killed her\u201d he asked.",
    "\u201cNo.",
    "I don\u2019t believe you\u2019d kill a woman because she persistently\nmade you look a fool at every meal.\u201d\nPoirot shook his head thoughtfully.",
    "Of course Mr. Emmott made Mrs. Leidner sound quite inhuman.",
    "There was something to be said on the other side too.",
    "There had been something terribly irritating about Mr. Reiter\u2019s\nattitude.",
    "He jumped when she spoke to him and did idiotic things like\npassing her the marmalade again and again when he knew she never ate\nit.",
    "I\u2019d have felt inclined to snap at him a bit myself.",
    "Men don\u2019t understand how their mannerisms can get on women\u2019s\nnerves so that you feel you just have to snap.",
    "I thought I\u2019d just mention that to Mr. Poirot some time.",
    "We had arrived back now and Mr. Emmott offered Poirot a wash and\ntook him into his room.",
    "I hurried across the courtyard to mine.",
    "I came out again about the same time they did and we were all\nmaking for the dining room when Father Lavigny appeared in the\ndoorway of his room and invited Poirot in.",
    "Mr. Emmott came on round and he and I went into the dining room\ntogether.",
    "Miss Johnson and Mrs. Mercado were there already and after a\nfew minutes Mr. Mercado Mr. Reiter and Bill Coleman joined us.",
    "We were just sitting down and Mercado had told the Arab boy to tell\nFather Lavigny lunch was ready when we were all startled by a faint\nmuffled cry.",
    "I suppose our nerves weren\u2019t very good yet for we all jumped and\nMiss Johnson got quite pale and said \u201cWhat was that What\u2019s\nhappened\u201d\nMrs. Mercado stared at her and said \u201cMy dear what is the matter\nwith you It\u2019s some noise outside in the fields.\u201d\nBut at that minute Poirot and Father Lavigny came in.",
    "\u201cWe thought someone was hurt\u201d Miss Johnson said.",
    "\u201cA thousand pardons mademoiselle\u201d cried Poirot.",
    "\u201cThe fault is\nmine.",
    "Father Lavigny he explains to me some tablets and I take one to\n\n\fthe window to see better\u2014and ma foi not looking where I was going I\nsteb the toe and the pain is sharp for the moment and I cry out.\u201d\n\u201cWe thought it was another murder\u201d said Mrs. Mercado laughing.",
    "\u201cMarie\u201d said her husband.",
    "His tone was reproachful and she flushed and bit her lip.",
    "Miss Johnson hastily turned the conversation to the dig and what\nobjects of interest had turned up that morning.",
    "Conversation all through\nlunch was sternly archaeological.",
    "I think we all felt it was the safest thing.",
    "After we had had coffee we adjourned to the living room.",
    "Then the\nmen with the exception of Father Lavigny went off to the dig again.",
    "Father Lavigny took Poirot through into the antika room and I went\nwith them.",
    "I was getting to know the things pretty well by now and I felt\na thrill of pride\u2014almost as though it were my own property\u2014when\nFather Lavigny took down the gold cup and I heard Poirot\u2019s exclamation\nof admiration and pleasure.",
    "\u201cHow beautiful What a work of art\u201d\nFather Lavigny agreed eagerly and began to point out its beauties\nwith real enthusiasm and knowledge.",
    "\u201cNo wax on it today\u201d I said.",
    "\u201cWax\u201d Poirot stared at me.",
    "\u201cWax\u201d So did Father Lavigny.",
    "I explained my remark.",
    "\u201cAh je comprends\u201d said Father Lavigny.",
    "\u201cYes yes candle grease.\u201d\nThat led direct to the subject of the midnight visitor.",
    "Forgetting my\npresence they both dropped into French and I left them together and\nwent back into the living room.",
    "Mrs. Mercado was darning her husband\u2019s socks and Miss Johnson\nwas reading a book.",
    "Rather an unusual thing for her.",
    "She usually seemed\nto have something to work at.",
    "After a while Father Lavigny and Poirot came out and the former\nexcused himself on the score of work.",
    "Poirot sat down with us.",
    "\u201cA most interesting man\u201d he said and asked how much work there\nhad been for Father Lavigny to do so far.",
    "Miss Johnson explained that tablets had been scarce and that there\nhad been very few inscribed bricks or cylinder seals.",
    "Father Lavigny\nhowever had done his share of work on the dig and was picking up\ncolloquial Arabic very fast.",
    "That led the talk to cylinder seals and presently Miss Johnson\nfetched from a cupboard a sheet of impressions made by rolling them out\non plasticine.",
    "I realized as we bent over them admiring the spirited designs that\nthese must be what she had been working at on that fatal afternoon.",
    "As we talked I noticed that Poirot was rolling and kneading a little\nball of plasticine between his fingers.",
    "\u201cYou use a lot of plasticine mademoiselle\u201d he asked.",
    "\u201cA fair amount.",
    "We seem to have got through a lot already this year\n\u2014though I can\u2019t imagine how.",
    "But half our supply seems to have gone.\u201d\n\u201cWhere is it kept mademoiselle\u201d\n\u201cHere\u2014in this cupboard.\u201d\nAs she replaced the sheet of impressions she showed him the shelf\nwith rolls of plasticine Durofix photographic paste and other stationery\nsupplies.",
    "Poirot stooped down.",
    "\u201cAnd this\u2014what is this mademoiselle\u201d\nHe had slipped his hand right to the back and had brought out a\ncurious crumpled object.",
    "As he straightened it out we could see that it was a kind of mask\nwith eyes and mouth crudely painted on it in Indian ink and the whole\nthing roughly smeared with plasticine.",
    "\u201cHow perfectly extraordinary\u201d cried Miss Johnson.",
    "\u201cI\u2019ve never seen\nit before.",
    "How did it get there And what is it\u201d\n\u201cAs to how it got there well one hidingplace is as good as another\nand I presume that this cupboard would not have been turned out till the\nend of the season.",
    "As to what it is\u2014that too I think is not difficult to\nsay.",
    "We have here the face that Mrs. Leidner described.",
    "The ghostly face\nseen in the semidusk outside her window\u2014without body attached.\u201d\nMrs. Mercado gave a little shriek.",
    "Miss Johnson was white to the lips.",
    "She murmured \u201cThen it was not\nfancy.",
    "It was a trick\u2014a wicked trick But who played it\u201d\n\u201cYes\u201d cried Mrs. Mercado.",
    "\u201cWho could have done such a wicked\nwicked thing\u201d\nPoirot did not attempt a reply.",
    "His face was very grim as he went\ninto the next room returned with an empty cardboard box in his hand\nand put the crumpled mask into it.",
    "\u201cThe police must see this\u201d he explained.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s horrible\u201d said Miss Johnson in a low voice.",

    "\u201cDo you think perhaps the weapon\u2014the club she\nwas killed with\u2014all covered with blood still perhaps .",

    "\u201cHere\u2019s Dr. Leidner.",
    "We mustn\u2019t upset\nhim.\u201d\nIndeed at that very moment the car had driven into the courtyard.",
    "Dr. Leidner got out of it and came straight across and in at the livingroom door.",
    "His face was set in lines of fatigue and he looked twice the\nage he had three days ago.",
    "He said in a quiet voice \u201cThe funeral will be at eleven o\u2019clock\ntomorrow.",
    "Major Deane will read the service.\u201d\nMrs. Mercado faltered something then slipped out of the room.",
    "Dr. Leidner said to Miss Johnson \u201cYou\u2019ll come Anne\u201d\nAnd she answered \u201cOf course my dear we\u2019ll all come.",
    "Naturally.\u201d\nShe didn\u2019t say anything else but her face must have expressed what\nher tongue was powerless to do for his face lightened up with affection\nand a momentary ease.",
    "\u201cDear Anne\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cYou are such a wonderful comfort and help\nto me.",
    "My dear old friend.\u201d\nHe laid his hand on her arm and I saw the red colour creep up in her\nface as she muttered gruff as ever \u201cThat\u2019s all right.\u201d\nBut I just caught a glimpse of her expression and knew that for one\nshort moment Anne Johnson was a perfectly happy woman.",
    "And another idea flashed across my mind.",
    "Perhaps soon in the\nnatural course of things turning to his old friend for sympathy a new\nand happy state of things might come about.",
    "Not that I\u2019m really a matchmaker and of course it was indecent to\nthink of such a thing before the funeral even.",
    "But after all it would be a\nhappy solution.",
    "He was very fond of her and there was no doubt she was\nabsolutely devoted to him and would be perfectly happy devoting the\nrest of her life to him.",
    "That is if she could bear to hear Louise\u2019s\nperfections sung all the time.",
    "But women can put up with a lot when\nthey\u2019ve got what they want.",
    "Dr. Leidner then greeted Poirot asking him if he had made any\nprogress.",
    "Miss Johnson was standing behind Dr. Leidner and she looked hard\nat the box in Poirot\u2019s hand and shook her head and I realized that she\nwas pleading with Poirot not to tell him about the mask.",
    "She felt I was\nsure that he had enough to bear for one day.",
    "Poirot fell in with her wish.",
    "\u201cThese things march slowly monsieur\u201d he said.",
    "Then after a few desultory words he took his leave.",
    "I accompanied him out to his car.",
    "There were half a dozen things I wanted to ask him but somehow\nwhen he turned and looked at me I didn\u2019t ask anything after all.",
    "I\u2019d as\nsoon have asked a surgeon if he thought he\u2019d made a good job of an\noperation.",
    "I just stood meekly waiting for instructions.",

    "\u201cBut I thought\nI\u2019d wait until after the funeral.\u201d\nHe nodded in approval.",
    "\u201cIn the meantime\u201d he said \u201cdo not try to find out too much.",

    "And he got in the car and was driven away and I went slowly back\nacross the courtyard wondering about a lot of things.",
    "About the hypodermic marks on Mr. Mercado\u2019s arm and what drug\nit was he took.",
    "And about that horrid yellow smeared mask.",
    "And how\nodd it was that Poirot and Miss Johnson hadn\u2019t heard my cry in the living\nroom that morning whereas we had all heard Poirot perfectly well in the\ndining room at lunchtime\u2014and yet Father Lavigny\u2019s room and\nMrs. Leidner\u2019s were just the same distance from the living room and the\ndining room respectively.",
    "And then I felt rather pleased that I\u2019d taught Doctor Poirot one\nEnglish phrase correctly\nEven if he was a great detective he\u2019d realize he didn\u2019t know\neverything\n\n\fTwentythree\nI GO PSYCHIC\n\nThe funeral was I thought a very affecting affair.",

    "I hoped that she\nwas feeling a little remorseful for all the unkind things she had said.",
    "When we got back to the house I followed Dr. Leidner into the office\nand broached the subject of my departure.",
    "He was very nice about it\nthanked me for what I had done Done I had been worse than useless\nand insisted on my accepting an extra week\u2019s salary.",

    "Then he shook his head.",
    "\u201cEven if she were malicious enough to wish to hurt Louise she\nwould hardly have the necessary knowledge\u201d he said.",
    "I remembered the earlier letters in the attach\u00e9 case.",

    "Men never seem to think of the simplest\npossibilities\n\u201cAnd apart from her there is only Miss Johnson\u201d I said watching\nhim.",
    "\u201cThat would be quite ridiculous\u201d\nThe little smile with which he said it was quite conclusive.",

    "What was done\nwas done.",
    "Why expose Dr. Leidner to a fresh disillusion on top of all his\nother troubles\nIt was arranged that I should leave on the following day and I had\narranged through Dr. Reilly to stay for a day or two with the matron of\nthe hospital whilst I made arrangements for returning to England either\nvia Baghdad or direct via Nissibin by car and train.",
    "Dr. Leidner was kind enough to say that he would like me to choose\na memento from amongst his wife\u2019s things.",

    "\u201cI couldn\u2019t.",

    "I couldn\u2019t\nreally.\u201d\n\u201cShe had no sisters you know\u2014no one who wants these things.",
    "There is no one else to have them.\u201d\n\n\fI could quite imagine that he wouldn\u2019t want them to fall into\nMrs. Mercado\u2019s greedy little hands.",

    "He went on kindly \u201cYou just think it over.",
    "By the way here is the\nkey of Louise\u2019s jewel case.",
    "Perhaps you will find something there you\nwould rather have.",
    "And I should be very grateful if you would pack up\u2014\nall her clothes.",
    "I daresay Reilly can find a use for them amongst some of\nthe poor Christian families in Hassanieh.\u201d\nI was very glad to be able to do that for him and I expressed my\nwillingness.",
    "I set about it at once.",
    "Mrs. Leidner had only had a very simple wardrobe with her and it\nwas soon sorted and packed up into a couple of suitcases.",
    "All her papers\nhad been in the small attach\u00e9 case.",
    "The jewel case contained a few\nsimple trinkets\u2014a pearl ring a diamond brooch a small string of pearls\nand one or two plain gold bar brooches of the safety pin type and a\nstring of large amber beads.",
    "Naturally I wasn\u2019t going to take the pearls or the diamonds but I\nhesitated a bit between the amber beads and the toilet set.",
    "In the end\nhowever I didn\u2019t see why I shouldn\u2019t take the latter.",
    "It was a kindly\nthought on Dr. Leidner\u2019s part and I was sure there wasn\u2019t any patronage\nabout it.",
    "I\u2019d take it in the spirit it had been offered without any false\npride.",
    "After all I had been fond of her.",
    "Well that was all done and finished with.",
    "The suitcases packed the\njewel case locked up again and put separate to give to Dr. Leidner with\nthe photograph of Mrs. Leidner\u2019s father and one or two other personal\nlittle odds and ends.",
    "The room looked bare and forlorn emptied of all its accoutrements\nwhen I\u2019d finished.",
    "There was nothing more for me to do\u2014and yet\nsomehow or other I shrank from leaving the room.",
    "It seemed as though\nthere was something still to do there\u2014something I ought to see\u2014or\nsomething I ought to have known.",
    "I\u2019m not superstitious but the idea did\npop into my head that perhaps Mrs. Leidner\u2019s spirit was hanging about\nthe room and trying to get in touch with me.",
    "I remember once at the hospital some of us girls got a planchette and\nreally it wrote some very remarkable things.",
    "Perhaps although I\u2019d never thought of such a thing I might be\nmediumistic.",
    "As I say one gets all worked up to imagine all sorts of foolishness\nsometimes.",
    "I prowled round the room uneasily touching this and that.",
    "But of\ncourse there wasn\u2019t anything in the room but bare furniture.",
    "There was\nnothing slipped behind drawers or tucked away.",
    "I couldn\u2019t hope for\nanything of that kind.",
    "In the end it sounds rather batty but as I say one gets worked up I\ndid rather a queer thing.",
    "I went and lay down in the bed and closed my eyes.",
    "I deliberately tried to forget who and what I was.",
    "I tried to think\nmyself back to that fatal afternoon.",
    "I was Mrs. Leidner lying here resting\npeaceful and unsuspicious.",
    "It\u2019s extraordinary how you can work yourself up.",
    "I\u2019m a perfectly normal matteroffact individual\u2014not the least bit\nspooky but I tell you that after I\u2019d lain there about five minutes I began\nto feel spooky.",
    "I didn\u2019t try to resist.",
    "I deliberately encouraged the feeling.",
    "I said to myself \u201cI\u2019m Mrs. Leidner.",
    "I\u2019m Mrs. Leidner.",
    "I\u2019m lying here\n\u2014half asleep.",
    "Presently\u2014very soon now\u2014the door\u2019s going to open.\u201d\nI kept on saying that\u2014as though I were hypnotizing myself.",

    "\u201cHow you startled me\u201d\n\u201cSorry\u201d he said with a momentary grin.",
    "I saw then that he was holding a little bunch of scarlet ranunculus in\nhis hand.",
    "They were pretty little flowers and they grew wild on the sides\nof the Tell.",
    "Mrs. Leidner had been fond of them.",
    "He blushed and got rather red as he said \u201cOne can\u2019t get any flowers\nor things in Hassanieh.",
    "Seemed rather rotten not to have any flowers for\nthe grave.",
    "I thought I\u2019d just nip in here and put a little posy in that little\npot thing she always had flowers in on her table.",
    "Sort of show she wasn\u2019t\nforgotten\u2014eh A bit asinine I know but\u2014well\u2014I mean to say.\u201d\nI thought it was very nice of him.",

    "I thought it was a very sweet thought.",
    "\u201cWhy I think that\u2019s a very nice idea Mr. Coleman\u201d I said.",
    "And I picked up the little pot and went and got some water in it and\nwe put the flowers in.",

    "He didn\u2019t seem offended though just laughed quite pleasantly and\nasked me if there were any news of the man with the squint.",
    "I said I didn\u2019t know but I hadn\u2019t heard of any.",
    "Father Lavigny asked me again about the time Mrs. Leidner and I\nhad noticed the man and how he had seemed to be standing on tiptoe and\npeering through the window.",

    "How far is it from the\nhead of the bed\u201d\nI thought.",

    "\u201cA person who\nis sleeping quite soundly will often wake up at the sound of a footfall.",
    "If\nthe table could be reached from the window it would be the safer way.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not only thinking of the glass\u201d said Captain Maitland absentmindedly.",
    "Rousing himself he addressed me once again.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s your opinion that when the poor lady felt she was dying she\nwas anxious to let you know that somebody had substituted acid for\nwater through the open window Surely the person\u2019s name would have\nbeen more to the point\u201d\n\u201cShe mayn\u2019t have known the name\u201d I pointed out.",

    "It may have seemed\nto her important that she should let people know that.",
    "In my opinion she\nwasn\u2019t far wrong either.",
    "It was important She probably jumped to the\nfact that you\u2019d think it was suicide.",
    "If she could have used her tongue\nfreely she\u2019d probably have said \u2018It wasn\u2019t suicide.",

    "Somebody else must have put it near my bed through the window.\u2019 \u201d\nCaptain Maitland drummed with his fingers for a minute or two\nwithout replying.",

    "It\u2019s either suicide or\nmurder.",
    "Which do you think Dr. Leidner\u201d\nDr. Leidner was silent for a minute or two then he said quietly and\ndecisively \u201cMurder.",

    "But there might be circumstances in which it would be quite a natural\nthing to do.\u201d\n\u201cSuch as\u201d\nCaptain Maitland stooped to a bundle which I had previously noticed\nhim place by the side of his chair.",

    "\u201cAnd now\u201d said Captain Maitland \u201cperhaps we shall get at the\ntruth\u201d\nHe spoke rather impatiently.",
    "He was essentially a man of action.",
    "At\nthis very moment I felt sure that he was fretting to be out and doing\nthings\u2014directing the search for Father Lavigny\u2019s body or alternatively\nsending out parties for his capture and arrest.",
    "He looked at Poirot with something akin to dislike.",
    "\u201cIf the beggar\u2019s got anything to say why doesn\u2019t he say it\u201d\nI could see the words on the tip of his tongue.",
    "Poirot gave a slow appraising glance at us all then rose to his feet.",

    "He was that kind of person.",
    "But I certainly didn\u2019t expect him to start off with a phrase in Arabic.",
    "Yet that is what happened.",
    "He said the words slowly and solemnly\u2014\nand really quite religiously if you know what I mean.",
    "\u201cBismillahi ar rahman ar rahim.\u201d\nAnd then he gave the translation in English.",
    "\u201cIn the name of Allah the Merciful the Compassionate.\u201d\n\n\fTwentyseven\nBEGINNING OF A JOURNEY\n\n\u201c\nBismillahi ar rahman ar rahim.",

    "A journey into the strange places of the human soul.\u201d\nI don\u2019t think that up till that moment I\u2019d ever felt any of the socalled \u201cglamour of the East.\u201d Frankly what had struck me was the mess\neverywhere.",
    "But suddenly with M. Poirot\u2019s words a queer sort of vision\nseemed to grow up before my eyes.",
    "I thought of words like Samarkand\nand Ispahan\u2014and of merchants with long beards\u2014and kneeling camels\n\u2014and staggering porters carrying great bales on their backs held by a\nrope round the forehead\u2014and women with hennastained hair and\ntattooed faces kneeling by the Tigris and washing clothes and I heard\ntheir queer wailing chants and the faroff groaning of the waterwheel.",
    "They were mostly things I\u2019d seen and heard and thought nothing\nmuch of.",
    "But now somehow they seemed different\u2014like a piece of fusty\nold stuff you take into the light and suddenly see the rich colours of an\nold embroidery. . . .\nThen I looked round the room we were sitting in and I got a queer\nfeeling that what M. Poirot said was true\u2014we were all starting on a\njourney.",
    "We were here together now but we were all going our different\nways.",
    "And I looked at everyone as though in a sort of way I were seeing\nthem for the first time\u2014and for the last time\u2014which sounds stupid but\nit was what I felt all the same.",
    "Mr. Mercado was twisting his fingers nervously\u2014his queer light\neyes with their dilated pupils were staring at Poirot.",
    "Mrs. Mercado was\n\n\flooking at her husband.",
    "She had a strange watchful look like a tigress\nwaiting to spring.",
    "Dr. Leidner seemed to have shrunk in some curious\nfashion.",
    "This last blow had just crumpled him up.",
    "You might almost say\nhe wasn\u2019t in the room at all.",
    "He was somewhere far away in a place of\nhis own.",
    "Mr. Coleman was looking straight at Poirot.",
    "His mouth was\nslightly open and his eyes protruded.",
    "He looked almost idiotic.",
    "Mr. Emmott was looking down at his feet and I couldn\u2019t see his face\nproperly.",
    "Mr. Reiter looked bewildered.",
    "His mouth was pushed out in a\npout and that made him look more like a nice clean pig than ever.",
    "Miss Reilly was looking steadily out of the window.",
    "I don\u2019t know what\nshe was thinking or feeling.",
    "Then I looked at Mr. Carey and somehow\nhis face hurt me and I looked away.",
    "There we were all of us.",
    "And\nsomehow I felt that when M. Poirot had finished we\u2019d all be somewhere\nquite different. . . .",
    "It was a queer feeling. . . .\nPoirot\u2019s voice went quietly on.",
    "It was like a river running evenly\nbetween its banks .",
    ". . running to the sea. . . .\n\u201cFrom the very beginning I have felt that to understand this case one\nmust seek not for external signs or clues but for the truer clues of the\nclash of personalities and the secrets of the heart.",
    "\u201cAnd I may say that though I have now arrived at what I believe to\nbe the true solution of the case I have no material proof of it.",
    "I know it is\nso because it must be so because in no other way can every single fact\nfit into its ordered and recognized place.",
    "\u201cAnd that to my mind is the most satisfying solution there can be.\u201d\nHe paused and then went on\n\u201cI will start my journey at the moment when I myself was brought\ninto the case\u2014when I had it presented to me as an accomplished\nhappening.",
    "Now every case in my opinion has a definite shape and\nform.",
    "The pattern of this case to my mind all revolved round the\npersonality of Mrs. Leidner.",
    "Until I knew exactly what kind of a woman\nMrs. Leidner was I should not be able to know why she was murdered\nand who murdered her.",
    "\u201cThat then was my starting point\u2014the personality of Mrs. Leidner.",
    "\u201cThere was also one other psychological point of interest\u2014the\ncurious state of tension described as existing amongst the members of\nthe expedition.",
    "This was attested to by several different witnesses\u2014some\nof them outsiders\u2014and I made a note that although hardly a starting\npoint it should nevertheless be borne in mind during my investigations.",
    "\u201cThe accepted idea seemed to be that it was directly the result of\nMrs. Leidner\u2019s influence on the members of the expedition but for\nreasons which I will outline to you later this did not seem to me entirely\nacceptable.",
    "\u201cTo start with as I say I concentrated solely and entirely on the\npersonality of Mrs. Leidner.",
    "I had various means of assessing that\npersonality.",
    "There were the reactions she produced in a number of\npeople all varying widely in character and temperament and there was\nwhat I could glean by my own observation.",
    "The scope of the latter was\nnaturally limited.",
    "But I did learn certain facts.",
    "\u201cMrs.",
    "Leidner\u2019s tastes were simple and even on the austere side.",
    "She\nwas clearly not a luxurious woman.",
    "On the other hand some embroidery\nshe had been doing was of an extreme fineness and beauty.",
    "That\nindicated a woman of fastidious and artistic taste.",
    "From the observation\nof the books in her bedroom I formed a further estimate.",
    "She had brains\nand I also fancied that she was essentially an egoist.",
    "\u201cIt had been suggested to me that Mrs. Leidner was a woman whose\nmain preoccupation was to attract the opposite sex\u2014that she was in fact\na sensual woman.",
    "This I did not believe to be the case.",
    "\u201cIn her bedroom I noticed the following books on a shelf Who were\nthe Greeks Introduction to Relativity Life of Lady Hester Stanhope\nBack to Methuselah Linda Condon Crewe Train.",
    "\u201cShe had to begin with an interest in culture and in modern science\n\u2014that is a distinct intellectual side.",
    "Of the novels Linda Condon and in\na lesser degree Crewe Train seemed to show that Mrs. Leidner had a\nsympathy and interest in the independent woman\u2014unencumbered or\nentrapped by man.",
    "She was also obviously interested by the personality\nof Lady Hester Stanhope.",
    "Linda Condon is an exquisite study of the\nworship of her own beauty by a woman.",
    "Crewe Train is a study of a\npassionate individualist Back to Methuselah is in sympathy with the\n\n\fintellectual rather than the emotional attitude to life.",
    "I felt that I was\nbeginning to understand the dead woman.",
    "\u201cI next studied the reactions of those who had formed Mrs. Leidner\u2019s\nimmediate circle\u2014and my picture of the dead woman grew more and\nmore complete.",
    "\u201cIt was quite clear to me from the accounts of Dr. Reilly and others\nthat Mrs. Leidner was one of those women who are endowed by Nature\nnot only with beauty but with the kind of calamitous magic which\nsometimes accompanies beauty and can indeed exist independently of\nit.",
    "Such women usually leave a trail of violent happenings behind them.",
    "They bring disaster\u2014sometimes on others\u2014sometimes on themselves.",
    "\u201cI was convinced that Mrs. Leidner was a woman who essentially\nworshipped herself and who enjoyed more than anything else the sense\nof power.",
    "Wherever she was she must be the centre of the universe.",
    "And\neveryone round her man or woman had got to acknowledge her sway.",
    "With some people that was easy.",
    "Nurse Leatheran for instance a\ngenerousnatured woman with a romantic imagination was captured\ninstantly and gave in ungrudging manner full appreciation.",
    "But there was\na second way in which Mrs. Leidner exercised her sway\u2014the way of\nfear.",
    "Where conquest was too easy she indulged a more cruel side to her\nnature\u2014but I wish to reiterate emphatically that it was not what you\nmight call conscious cruelty.",
    "It was as natural and unthinking as is the\nconduct of a cat with a mouse.",
    "Where consciousness came in she was\nessentially kind and would often go out of her way to do kind and\nthoughtful actions for other people.",
    "\u201cNow of course the first and most important problem to solve was\nthe problem of the anonymous letters.",
    "Who had written them and why I\nasked myself Had Mrs. Leidner written them herself\n\u201cTo answer this problem it was necessary to go back a long way\u2014to\ngo back in fact to the date of Mrs. Leidner\u2019s first marriage.",
    "It is here we\nstart on our journey proper.",
    "The journey of Mrs. Leidner\u2019s life.",
    "\u201cFirst of all we must realize that the Louise Leidner of all those\nyears ago is essentially the same Louise Leidner of the present time.",
    "\u201cShe was young then of remarkable beauty\u2014that same haunting\nbeauty that affects a man\u2019s spirit and senses as no mere material beauty\n\n\fcan\u2014and she was already essentially an egoist.",
    "\u201cSuch women naturally revolt from the idea of marriage.",
    "They may\nbe attracted by men but they prefer to belong to themselves.",
    "They are\ntruly La Belle Dame sans Merci of the legend.",
    "Nevertheless Mrs. Leidner\ndid marry\u2014and we can assume I think that her husband must have been\na man of a certain force of character.",
    "\u201cThen the revelation of his traitorous activities occurs and\nMrs. Leidner acts in the way she told Nurse Leidner.",
    "She gave\ninformation to the Government.",
    "\u201cNow I submit that there was a psychological significance in her\naction.",
    "She told Nurse Leatheran that she was a very patriotic idealistic\ngirl and that that feeling was the cause of her action.",
    "But it is a wellknown fact that we all tend to deceive ourselves as to the motives for our\nown actions.",
    "Instinctively we select the bestsounding motive\nMrs. Leidner may have believed herself that it was patriotism that\ninspired her action but I believe myself that it was really the outcome of\nan unacknowledged desire to get rid of her husband She disliked\ndomination\u2014she disliked the feeling of belonging to someone else\u2014in\nfact she disliked playing second fiddle.",
    "She took a patriotic way of\nregaining her freedom.",
    "\u201cBut underneath her consciousness was a gnawing sense of guilt\nwhich was to play its part in her future destiny.",
    "\u201cWe now come directly to the question of the letters.",
    "Mrs. Leidner\nwas highly attractive to the male sex.",
    "On several occasions she was\nattracted by them\u2014but in each case a threatening letter played its part\nand the affair came to nothing.",
    "\u201cWho wrote those letters Frederick Bosner or his brother William\nor Mrs. Leidner herself\n\u201cThere is a perfectly good case for either theory.",
    "It seems clear to me\nthat Mrs. Leidner was one of those women who do inspire devouring\ndevotions in men the type of devotion which can become an obsession.",
    "I\nfind it quite possible to believe in a Frederick Bosner to whom Louise\nhis wife mattered more than anything in the world She had betrayed\nhim once and he dared not approach her openly but he was determined\n\n\fat least that she should be his or no one\u2019s.",
    "He preferred her death to her\nbelonging to another man.",
    "\u201cOn the other hand if Mrs. Leidner had deep down a dislike of\nentering into the marriage bond it is possible that she took this way of\nextricating herself from difficult positions.",
    "She was a huntress who the\nprey once attained had no further use for it Craving drama in her life\nshe invented a highly satisfactory drama\u2014a resurrected husband\nforbidding the banns It satisfied her deepest instincts.",
    "It made her a\nromantic figure a tragic heroine and it enabled her not to marry again.",
    "\u201cThis state of affairs continued over a number of years.",
    "Every time\nthere was any likelihood of marriage\u2014a threatening letter arrived.",
    "\u201cBut now we come to a really interesting point.",
    "Dr. Leidner came\nupon the scene\u2014and no forbidding letter arrived Nothing stood in the\nway of her becoming Mrs. Leidner.",
    "Not until after her marriage did a\nletter arrive.",
    "\u201cAt once we ask ourselves\u2014why\n\u201cLet us take each theory in turn.\n. . . \u201cIf Mrs. Leidner wrote the letters herself the problem is easily\nexplained.",
    "Mrs. Leidner really wanted to marry Dr. Leidner.",
    "And so she\ndid marry him.",
    "But in that case why did she write herself a letter\nafterwards Was her craving for drama too strong to be suppressed And\nwhy only those two letters After that no other letter was received until a\nyear and a half later.",
    "\u201cNow take the other theory that the letters were written by her first\nhusband Frederick Bosner or his brother.",
    "Why did the threatening\nletter arrive after the marriage Presumably Frederick could not have\nwanted her to marry Leidner.",
    "Why then did he not stop the marriage\nHe had done so successfully on former occasions.",
    "And why having\nwaited till the marriage had taken place did he then resume his threats\n\u201cThe answer an unsatisfactory one is that he was somehow or other\nunable to protest sooner.",
    "He may have been in prison or he may have\nbeen abroad.",
    "\u201cThere is next the attempted gas poisoning to consider.",
    "It seems\nextremely unlikely that it was brought about by an outside agency.",
    "The\nlikely persons to have staged it were Dr. and Mrs. Leidner themselves.",
    "There seems no conceivable reason why Dr. Leidner should do such a\nthing so we are brought to the conclusion that Mrs. Leidner planned and\ncarried it out herself.",
    "\u201cWhy More drama\n\u201cAfter that Dr. and Mrs. Leidner go abroad and for eighteen months\nthey lead a happy peaceful life with no threats of death to disturb it.",
    "They put that down to having successfully covered their traces but such\nan explanation is quite absurd.",
    "In these days going abroad is quite\ninadequate for that purpose.",
    "And especially was that so in the case of the\nLeidners.",
    "He was the director of a museum expedition.",
    "By inquiry at the\nmuseum Frederick Bosner could at once have obtained his correct\naddress.",
    "Even granting that he was in too reduced circumstances to\npursue the couple himself there would be no bar to his continuing his\nthreatening letters.",
    "And it seems to me that a man with his obsession\nwould certainly have done so.",
    "\u201cInstead nothing is heard of him until nearly two years later when\nthe letters are resumed.",
    "\u201cWhy were the letters resumed\n\u201cA very difficult question\u2014most easily answered by saying that\nMrs. Leidner was bored and wanted more drama.",
    "But I was not quite\nsatisfied with that.",
    "This particular form of drama seemed to me a shade\ntoo vulgar and too crude to accord well with her fastidious personality.",
    "\u201cThe only thing to do was to keep an open mind on the question.",
    "\u201cThere were three definite possibilities 1 the letters were written\nby Mrs. Leidner herself 2 they were written by Frederick Bosner or\nyoung William Bosner 3 they might have been written originally by\neither Mrs. Leidner or her first husband but they were now forgeries\u2014\nthat is they were being written by a third person who was aware of the\nearlier letters.",

    "I think Miss Reilly\nwas conscious then that she had had in her heart the desire at least to\nkill.",
    "At any rate she immediately uttered a very silly and purposeless lie.",
    "She said she had been playing tennis on that afternoon.",
    "The next day I\nlearned from a casual conversation with Miss Johnson that far from\nplaying tennis Miss Reilly had actually been near this house at the time\nof the murder.",
    "It occurred to me that Miss Reilly if not guilty of the\ncrime might be able to tell me something useful.\u201d\nHe stopped and then said quietly \u201cWill you tell us Miss Reilly\nwhat you did see that afternoon\u201d\nThe girl did not answer at once.",
    "She still looked out of the window\nwithout turning her head and when she spoke it was in a detached and\nmeasured voice.",
    "\u201cI rode out to the dig after lunch.",
    "It must have been about a quarter\nto two when I got there.\u201d\n\u201cDid you find any of your friends on the dig\u201d\n\u201cNo there seemed to be no one there but the Arab foreman.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cYou did not see Mr. Carey\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cCurious\u201d said Poirot.",
    "\u201cNo more did M. Verrier when he went there\nthat same afternoon.\u201d\nHe looked invitingly at Carey but the latter neither moved nor\nspoke.",
    "\u201cHave you any explanation Mr. Carey\u201d\n\u201cI went for a walk.",
    "There was nothing of interest turning up.\u201d\n\u201cIn which direction did you go for a walk\u201d\n\u201cDown by the river.\u201d\n\u201cNot back towards the house\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cI suppose\u201d said Miss Reilly \u201cthat you were waiting for someone\nwho didn\u2019t come.\u201d\nHe looked at her but didn\u2019t answer.",
    "Poirot did not press the point.",
    "He spoke once more to the girl.",

    "I was not far from the expedition house when I noticed the\nexpedition lorry drawn up in a wadi.",
    "I thought it was rather queer.",
    "Then I\nsaw Mr. Coleman.",
    "He was walking along with his head down as though\nhe were searching for something.\u201d\n\u201cLook here\u201d burst out Mr. Coleman \u201cI\u2014\u201d\nPoirot stopped him with an authoritative gesture.",
    "\u201cWait.",
    "Did you speak to him Miss Reilly\u201d\n\u201cNo.",
    "I didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cWhy\u201d\nThe girl said slowly \u201cBecause from time to time he started and\nlooked round with an extraordinary furtive look.",
    "It\u2014gave me an\nunpleasant feeling.",
    "I turned my horse\u2019s head and rode away.",
    "I don\u2019t think\nhe saw me.",
    "I was not very near and he was absorbed in what he was\ndoing.\u201d\n\u201cLook here\u201d Mr. Coleman was not to be hushed any longer.",
    "\u201cI\u2019ve\ngot a perfectly good explanation for what\u2014I admit\u2014looks a bit fishy.",
    "As\na matter of fact the day before I had slipped a jolly fine cylinder seal\n\n\finto my coat pocket instead of putting it in the antika room\u2014forgot all\nabout it.",
    "And then I discovered I\u2019d been and lost it out of my pocket\u2014\ndropped it somewhere.",
    "I didn\u2019t want to get into a row about it so I\ndecided I\u2019d have a jolly good search on the quiet.",
    "I was pretty sure I\u2019d\ndropped it on the way to or from the dig.",
    "I rushed over my business in\nHassanieh.",
    "Sent a walad to do some of the shopping and got back early.",
    "I\nstuck the bus where it wouldn\u2019t show and had a jolly good hunt for over\nan hour.",
    "And didn\u2019t find the damned thing at that Then I got into the bus\nand drove on to the house.",

    "\u201cWell that was pretty natural under the circumstances don\u2019t you\nthink\u201d\n\u201cI hardly agree\u201d said Poirot.",
    "\u201cOh come now\u2014don\u2019t go looking for trouble\u2014that\u2019s my motto But\nyou can\u2019t fasten anything on me.",
    "I never went into the courtyard and\nyou can\u2019t find anyone who\u2019ll say I did.\u201d\n\u201cThat of course has been the difficulty\u201d said Poirot.",
    "\u201cThe evidence\nof the servants that no one entered the courtyard from outside.",
    "But it\noccurred to me upon reflection that that was really not what they had\nsaid.",
    "They had sworn that no stranger had entered the premises.",
    "They\nhad not been asked if a member of the expedition had done so.\u201d\n\u201cWell you ask them\u201d said Coleman.",
    "\u201cI\u2019ll eat my hat if they saw me\nor Carey either.\u201d\n\u201cAh but that raises rather an interesting question.",
    "They would\nnotice a stranger undoubtedly\u2014but would they have even noticed a\nmember of the expedition The members of the staff are passing in and\nout all day.",
    "The servants would hardly notice their going and coming.",
    "It\nis possible I think that either Mr. Carey or Mr. Coleman might have\nentered and the servants\u2019 minds would have no remembrance of such an\nevent.\u201d\n\u201cBunkum\u201d said Mr. Coleman.",
    "Poirot went on calmly \u201cOf the two I think Mr. Carey was the least\nlikely to be noticed going or coming.",
    "Mr. Coleman had started to\n\n\fHassanieh in the car that morning and he would be expected to return in\nit.",
    "His arrival on foot would therefore be noticeable.\u201d\n\u201cOf course it would\u201d said Coleman.",
    "Richard Carey raised his head.",
    "His deepblue eyes looked straight at\nPoirot.",
    "\u201cAre you accusing me of murder M. Poirot\u201d he asked.",
    "His manner was quite quiet but his voice had a dangerous undertone.",
    "Poirot bowed to him.",
    "\u201cAs yet I am only taking you all on a journey\u2014my journey towards\nthe truth.",
    "I had now established one fact\u2014that all the members of the\nexpedition staff and also Nurse Leatheran could in actual fact have\ncommitted the murder.",
    "That there was very little likelihood of some of\nthem having committed it was a secondary matter.",
    "\u201cI had examined means and opportunity.",
    "I next passed to motive.",
    "I\ndiscovered that one and all of you could be credited with a motive\u201d\n\u201cOh M. Poirot\u201d I cried.",
    "\u201cNot me Why I was a stranger.",
    "I\u2019d only\njust come.\u201d\n\u201cEh bien ma soeur and was not that just what Mrs. Leidner had\nbeen fearing A stranger from outside\u201d\n\u201cBut\u2014but\u2014Why Dr. Reilly knew all about me He suggested my\ncoming\u201d\n\u201cHow much did he really know about you Mostly what you yourself\nhad told him.",
    "Imposters have passed themselves off as hospital nurses\nbefore now.\u201d\n\u201cYou can write to St. Christopher\u2019s\u201d I began.",
    "\u201cFor the moment will you silence yourself.",
    "Impossible to proceed\nwhile you conduct this argument.",
    "I do not say I suspect you now.",
    "All I\nsay is that keeping the open mind you might quite easily be someone\nother than you pretended to be.",
    "There are many successful female\nimpersonators you know.",
    "Young William Bosner might be something of\nthat kind.\u201d\nI was about to give him a further piece of my mind.",
    "Female\nimpersonator indeed But he raised his voice and hurried on with such an\nair of determination that I thought better of it.",
    "\u201cI am going now to be frank\u2014brutally so.",
    "It is necessary.",
    "I am going\nto lay bare the underlying structure of this place.",
    "\u201cI examined and considered every single soul here.",
    "To begin with\nDr. Leidner I soon convinced myself that his love for his wife was the\nmainspring of his existence.",
    "He was a man torn and ravaged with grief.",
    "Nurse Leatheran I have already mentioned.",
    "If she were a female\nimpersonator she was a most amazingly successful one and I inclined to\nthe belief that she was exactly what she said she was\u2014a thoroughly\ncompetent hospital nurse.\u201d\n\u201cThank you for nothing\u201d I interposed.",
    "\u201cMy attention was immediately attracted towards Mr. and\nMrs. Mercado who were both of them clearly in a state of great agitation\nand unrest.",
    "I considered first Mrs. Mercado.",
    "Was she capable of murder\nand if so for what reasons\n\u201cMrs.",
    "Mercado\u2019s physique was frail.",
    "At first sight it did not seem\npossible that she could have had the physical strength to strike down a\nwoman like Mrs. Leidner with a heavy stone implement.",
    "If however\nMrs. Leidner had been on her knees at the time the thing would at least\nbe physically possible.",
    "There are ways in which one woman can induce\nanother to go down on her knees.",
    "Oh not emotional ways For instance\na woman might be turning up the hem of a skirt and ask another woman\nto put in the pins for her.",
    "The second woman would kneel on the ground\nquite unsuspectingly.",
    "\u201cBut the motive Nurse Leatheran had told me of the angry glances\nshe had seen Mrs. Mercado direct at Mrs. Leidner.",
    "Mr. Mercado had\nevidently succumbed easily to Mrs. Leidner\u2019s spell.",
    "But I did not think\nthe solution was to be found in mere jealousy.",
    "I was sure Mrs. Leidner\nwas not in the least interested really in Mr. Mercado\u2014and doubtless\nMrs. Mercado was aware of the fact.",
    "She might be furious with her for\nthe moment but for murder there would have to be greater provocation.",
    "But Mrs. Mercado was essentially a fiercely maternal type.",
    "From the\nway she looked at her husband I realized not only that she loved him\nbut that she would fight for him tooth and nail\u2014and more than that\u2014\nthat she envisaged the possibility of having to do so.",
    "She was constantly\non her guard and uneasy.",
    "The uneasiness was for him\u2014not for herself.",
    "And when I studied Mr. Mercado I could make a fairly easy guess at\nwhat the trouble was.",
    "I took means to assure myself of the truth of my\nguess.",
    "Mr. Mercado was a drug addict\u2014in an advanced stage of the\ncraving.",
    "\u201cNow I need probably not tell you all that the taking of drugs over a\nlong period has the result of considerably blunting the moral sense.",
    "\u201cUnder the influence of drugs a man commits actions that he would\nnot have dreamed of committing a few years earlier before he began the\npractice.",
    "In some cases a man has committed murder\u2014and it has been\ndifficult to say whether he was wholly responsible for his actions or not.",
    "The law of different countries varies slightly on that point.",
    "The chief\ncharacteristic of the drugfiend criminal is overweening confidence in his\nown cleverness.",
    "\u201cI thought it possible that there was some discreditable incident\nperhaps a criminal incident in Mr. Mercado\u2019s past which his wife had\nsomehow or other succeeded in hushing up.",
    "Nevertheless his career hung\non a thread.",
    "If anything of this past incident were bruited about\nMr. Mercado would be ruined.",
    "His wife was always on the watch.",
    "But\nthere was Mrs. Leidner to be reckoned with.",
    "She had a sharp intelligence\nand a love of power.",
    "She might even induce the wretched man to confide\nin her.",
    "It would just have suited her peculiar temperament to feel she\nknew a secret which she could reveal at any minute with disastrous\neffects.",
    "\u201cHere then was a possible motive for murder on the part of the\nMercados.",
    "To protect her mate Mrs. Mercado I felt sure would stick at\nnothing Both she and her husband had had the opportunity\u2014during that\nten minutes when the courtyard was empty.\u201d\nMrs. Mercado cried out \u201cIt\u2019s not true\u201d\nPoirot paid no attention.",
    "\u201cI next considered Miss Johnson.",
    "Was she capable of murder\n\u201cI thought she was.",
    "She was a person of strong will and iron selfcontrol.",
    "Such people are constantly repressing themselves\u2014and one day\nthe dam bursts But if Miss Johnson had committed the crime it could\nonly be for some reason connected with Dr. Leidner.",
    "If in any way she\nfelt convinced that Mrs. Leidner was spoiling her husband\u2019s life then the\n\n\fdeep unacknowledged jealousy far down in her would leap at the chance\nof a plausible motive and give itself full rein.",
    "\u201cYes Miss Johnson was distinctly a possibility.",
    "\u201cThen there were the three young men.",
    "\u201cFirst Carl Reiter.",
    "If by any chance one of the expedition staff was\nWilliam Bosner then Reiter was by far the most likely person.",
    "But if he\nwas William Bosner then he was certainly a most accomplished actor If\nhe were merely himself had he any reason for murder\n\u201cRegarded from Mrs. Leidner\u2019s point of view Carl Reiter was far\ntoo easy a victim for good sport.",
    "He was prepared to fall on his face and\nworship immediately.",
    "Mrs. Leidner despised undiscriminating adoration\n\u2014and the doormat attitude nearly always brings out the worst side of a\nwoman.",
    "In her treatment of Carl Reiter Mrs. Leidner displayed really\ndeliberate cruelty.",
    "She inserted a gibe here\u2014a prick there.",
    "She made the\npoor young man\u2019s life a hell to him.\u201d\nPoirot broke off suddenly and addressed the young man in a\npersonal highly confidential manner.",
    "\u201cMon ami let this be a lesson to you.",
    "You are a man.",
    "Behave then\nlike a man It is against Nature for a man to grovel.",
    "Women and Nature\nhave almost exactly the same reactions Remember it is better to take the\nlargest plate within reach and fling it at a woman\u2019s head than it is to\nwriggle like a worm whenever she looks at you\u201d\nHe dropped his private manner and reverted to his lecture style.",
    "\u201cCould Carl Reiter have been goaded to such a pitch of torment that\nhe turned on his tormentor and killed her Suffering does queer things to\na man.",
    "I could not be sure that it was not so\n\u201cNext William Coleman.",
    "His behaviour as reported by Miss Reilly\nis certainly suspicious.",
    "If he was the criminal it could only be because his\ncheerful personality concealed the hidden one of William Bosner.",
    "I do\nnot think William Coleman as William Coleman has the temperament\nof a murderer.",
    "His faults might lie in another direction.",
    "Ah perhaps\nNurse Leatheran can guess what they would be\u201d\nHow did the man do it I\u2019m sure I didn\u2019t look as though I was\nthinking anything at all.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s nothing really\u201d I said hesitating.",
    "\u201cOnly if it\u2019s to be all truth\nMr. Coleman did say once himself that he would have made a good\nforger.\u201d\n\u201cA good point\u201d said Poirot.",
    "\u201cTherefore if he had come across some\nof the old threatening letters he could have copied them without\ndifficulty.\u201d\n\u201cOy oy oy\u201d called out Mr. Coleman.",
    "\u201cThis is what they call a\nframeup.\u201d\nPoirot swept on.",
    "\u201cAs to his being or not being William Bosner such a matter is\ndifficult of verification.",
    "But Mr. Coleman has spoken of a guardian\u2014not\nof a father\u2014and there is nothing definitely to veto the idea.\u201d\n\u201cTommyrot\u201d said Mr. Coleman.",
    "\u201cWhy all of you listen to this chap\nbeats me.\u201d\n\u201cOf the three young men there remains Mr. Emmott\u201d went on\nPoirot.",
    "\u201cHe again might be a possible shield for the identity of William\nBosner.",
    "Whatever personal reasons he might have for the removal of\nMrs. Leidner I soon realized that I should have no means of learning\nthem from him.",
    "He could keep his own counsel remarkably well and\nthere was not the least chance of provoking him nor of tricking him into\nbetraying himself on any point.",
    "Of all the expedition he seemed to be the\nbest and most dispassionate judge of Mrs. Leidner\u2019s personality.",
    "I think\nthat he always knew her for exactly what she was\u2014but what impression\nher personality made on him I was unable to discover.",
    "I fancy that\nMrs. Leidner herself must have been provoked and angered by his\nattitude.",
    "\u201cI may say that of all the expedition as far as character and\ncapacity were concerned Mr. Emmott seemed to me the most fitted to\nbring a clever and welltimed crime off satisfactorily.\u201d\nFor the first time Mr. Emmott raised his eyes from the toes of his\nboots.",
    "\u201cThank you\u201d he said.",
    "There seemed to be just a trace of amusement in his voice.",
    "\u201cThe last two people on my list were Richard Carey and Father\nLavigny.",
    "\u201cAccording to the testimony of Nurse Leatheran and others\nMr. Carey and Mrs. Leidner disliked each other.",
    "They were both civil\nwith an effort.",
    "Another person Miss Reilly propounded a totally\ndifferent theory to account for their attitude of frigid politeness.",
    "\u201cI soon had very little doubt that Miss Reilly\u2019s explanation was the\ncorrect one.",
    "I acquired my certitude by the simple expedient of\nprovoking Mr. Carey into reckless and unguarded speech.",
    "It was not\ndifficult.",
    "As I soon saw he was in a state of high nervous tension.",
    "In fact\nhe was\u2014and is\u2014very near a complete nervous breakdown.",
    "A man who\nis suffering up to the limit of his capacity can seldom put up much of a\nfight.",
    "\u201cMr.",
    "Carey\u2019s barriers came down almost immediately.",
    "He told me\nwith a sincerity that I did not for a moment doubt that he hated\nMrs. Leidner.",
    "\u201cAnd he was undoubtedly speaking the truth.",
    "He did hate\nMrs. Leidner.",
    "But why did he hate her\n\u201cI have spoken of women who have a calamitous magic.",
    "But men\nhave that magic too.",
    "There are men who are able without the least effort\nto attract women.",
    "What they call in these days le sex appeal Mr. Carey\nhad this quality very strongly.",
    "He was to begin with devoted to his friend\nand employer and indifferent to his employer\u2019s wife.",
    "That did not suit\nMrs. Leidner.",
    "She must dominate\u2014and she set herself out to capture\nRichard Carey.",
    "But here I believe something entirely unforeseen took\nplace.",
    "She herself for perhaps the first time in her life fell a victim to an\novermastering passion.",
    "She fell in love\u2014really in love\u2014with Richard\nCarey.",
    "\u201cAnd he\u2014was unable to resist her.",
    "Here is the truth of the terrible\nstate of nervous tension that he has been enduring.",
    "He has been a man\ntorn by two opposing passions.",
    "He loved Louise Leidner\u2014yes but he\nalso hated her.",
    "He hated her for undermining his loyalty to his friend.",
    "There is no hatred so great as that of a man who has been made to love a\nwoman against his will.",
    "\u201cI had here all the motive that I needed.",
    "I was convinced that at\ncertain moments the most natural thing for Richard Carey to do would\n\n\fhave been to strike with all the force of his arm at the beautiful face that\nhad cast a spell over him.",
    "\u201cAll along I had felt sure that the murder of Louise Leidner was a\ncrime passionnel.",
    "In Mr. Carey I had found an ideal murderer for that\ntype of crime.",
    "\u201cThere remains one other candidate for the title of murderer\u2014Father\nLavigny.",
    "My attention was attracted to the good Father straightaway by a\ncertain discrepancy between his description of the strange man who had\nbeen seen peering in at the window and the one given by Nurse\nLeatheran.",
    "In all accounts given by different witnesses there is usually\nsome discrepancy but this was absolutely glaring.",
    "Moreover Father\nLavigny insisted on a certain characteristic\u2014a squint\u2014which ought to\nmake identification much easier.",
    "\u201cBut very soon it became apparent that while Nurse Leatheran\u2019s\ndescription was substantially accurate Father Lavigny\u2019s was nothing of\nthe kind.",
    "It looked almost as though Father Lavigny was deliberately\nmisleading us\u2014as though he did not want the man caught.",
    "\u201cBut in that case he must know something about this curious person.",
    "He had been seen talking to the man but we had only his word for what\nthey had been talking about.",
    "\u201cWhat had the Iraqi been doing when Nurse Leatheran and\nMrs. Leidner saw him Trying to peer through the window\u2014\nMrs. Leidner\u2019s window so they thought but I realized when I went and\nstood where they had been that it might equally have been the antika\nroom window.",
    "\u201cThe night after that an alarm was given.",
    "Someone was in the antika\nroom.",
    "Nothing proved to have been taken however.",
    "The interesting point\nto me is that when Dr. Leidner got there he found Father Lavigny there\nbefore him.",
    "Father Lavigny tells his story of seeing a light.",
    "But again we\nhave only his word for it.",
    "\u201cI begin to get curious about Father Lavigny.",
    "The other day when I\nmake the suggestion that Father Lavigny may be Frederick Bosner\nDr. Leidner poohpoohs the suggestion.",
    "He says Father Lavigny is a\nwellknown man.",
    "I advance the supposition that Frederick Bosner who\nhas had nearly twenty years to make a career for himself under a new\n\n\fname may very possibly be a wellknown man by this time All the\nsame I do not think that he has spent the intervening time in a religious\ncommunity.",
    "A very much simpler solution presents itself.",
    "\u201cDid anyone at the expedition know Father Lavigny by sight before\nhe came Apparently not.",
    "Why then should not it be someone\nimpersonating the good Father I found out that a telegram had been\nsent to Carthage on the sudden illness of Dr. Byrd who was to have\naccompanied the expedition.",
    "To intercept a telegram what could be\neasier As to the work there was no other epigraphist attached to the\nexpedition.",
    "With a smattering of knowledge a clever man might bluff his\nway through.",
    "There had been very few tablets and inscriptions so far and\nalready I gathered that Father Lavigny\u2019s pronouncements had been felt to\nbe somewhat unusual.",
    "\u201cIt looked very much as though Father Lavigny were an imposter.",
    "\u201cBut was he Frederick Bosner\n\u201cSomehow affairs did not seem to be shaping themselves that way.",
    "The truth seemed likely to lie in quite a different direction.",
    "\u201cI had a lengthy conversation with Father Lavigny.",
    "I am a practising\nCatholic and I know many priests and members of religious\ncommunities.",
    "Father Lavigny struck me as not ringing quite true to his\nrole.",
    "But he struck me on the other hand as familiar in quite a different\ncapacity.",
    "I had met men of his type quite frequently\u2014but they were not\nmembers of a religious community.",
    "Far from it\n\u201cI began to send off telegrams.",
    "\u201cAnd then unwittingly Nurse Leatheran gave me a valuable clue.",
    "We were examining the gold ornaments in the antika room and she\nmentioned a trace of wax having been found adhering to a gold cup.",
    "Me\nI say \u2018Wax\u2019 and Father Lavigny he said \u2018Wax\u2019 and his tone was\nenough I knew in a flash exactly what he was doing here.\u201d\nPoirot paused and addressed himself directly to Dr. Leidner.",
    "\u201cI regret to tell you monsieur that the gold cup in the antika room\nthe gold dagger the hair ornaments and several other things are not the\ngenuine articles found by you.",
    "They are very clever electrotypes.",
    "Father\nLavigny I have just learned by this last answer to my telegrams is none\nother than Raoul Menier one of the cleverest thieves known to the\n\n\fFrench police.",
    "He specializes in thefts from museums of objets d\u2019art and\nsuch like.",
    "Associated with him is Ali Yusuf a semiTurk who is a firstclass working jeweller.",
    "Our first knowledge of Menier was when certain\nobjects in the Louvre were found not to be genuine\u2014in every case it was\ndiscovered that a distinguished archaeologist not known previously by\nsight to the director had recently had the handling of the spurious articles\nwhen paying a visit to the Louvre.",
    "On inquiry all these distinguished\ngentlemen denied having paid a visit to the Louvre at the times stated\n\u201cI have learned that Menier was in Tunis preparing the way for a\ntheft from the Holy Fathers when your telegram arrived.",
    "Father Lavigny\nwho was in ill health was forced to refuse but Menier managed to get\nhold of the telegram and substitute one of acceptance.",
    "He was quite safe\nin doing so.",
