    "Her narrow black eyes narrowed themselves still more\nthe long line of her scarlet mouth curved faintly upwards.",
    "Enthusiastic Frenchmen continued\nto beat the ground appreciatively as the curtain fell with a swish hiding the reds and blues\nand magentas of the bizarre d\u00e9cor.",
    "In a swirl of blue and orange draperies the dancer left\nthe stage.",
    "A bearded gentleman received her enthusiastically in his arms.",
    "It was the\nManager.",
    "\u201cMagnificent petite magnificent\u201d he cried.",
    "\u201cTonight you have surpassed yourself.\u201d He\nkissed her gallantly on both cheeks in a somewhat matteroffact manner.",
    "Madame Nadina accepted the tribute with the ease of long habit and passed on to her\ndressing room where bouquets were heaped carelessly everywhere marvellous garments\nof futuristic design hung on pegs and the air was hot and sweet with the scent of the massed\nblossoms and with the more sophisticated perfumes and essences.",
    "Jeanne the dresser\nministered to her mistress talking incessantly and pouring out a stream of fulsome\ncompliments.",
    "A knock at the door interrupted the flow Jeanne went to answer it and returned with a\ncard in her hand.",
    "\u201cMadame will receive\u201d\n\u201cLet me see.\u201d\nThe dancer stretched out a languid hand but at the sight of the name on the card \u201cCount\nSergius Paulovitch\u201d a sudden flicker of interest came into her eyes.",
    "\u201cI will see him.",
    "The maize peignoir Jeanne and quickly.",
    "And when the Count comes you\nmay go.\u201d\n\u201cBien Madame.\u201d\nJeanne brought the peignoir an exquisite wisp of corncoloured chiffon and ermine.",
    "Nadina slipped into it and sat smiling to herself whilst one long white hand beat a slow\ntattoo on the glass of the dressing table.",
    "The Count was prompt to avail himself of the privilege accorded to him\u2014a man of\nmedium height very slim very elegant very pale extraordinarily weary.",
    "In feature little to\ntake hold of a man difficult to recognize again if one left his mannerisms out of account.",
    "He\nbowed over the dancer\u2019s hand with exaggerated courtliness.",
    "\u201cMadame this is a pleasure indeed.\u201d\nSo much Jeanne heard before she went out closing the door behind her.",
    "Alone with her\nvisitor a subtle change came over Nadina\u2019s smile.",
    "\u201cCompatriots though we are we will not speak Russian I think\u201d she observed.",
    "\u201cSince we neither of us know a word of the language it might be as well\u201d agreed her\nguest.",
    "By common consent they dropped into English and nobody now that the Count\u2019s\nmannerisms had dropped from him could doubt that it was his native language.",
    "He had\nindeed started life as a quickchange musichall artiste in London.",
    "\u201cYou had great success tonight\u201d he remarked.",
    "\u201cI congratulate you.\u201d\n\u201cAll the same\u201d said the woman \u201cI am disturbed.",
    "My position is not what it was.",
    "The\nsuspicions aroused during the War have never died down.",
    "I am continually watched and\nspied upon.\u201d\n\u201cBut no charge of espionage was ever brought against you\u201d\n\u201cOur chief lays his plans too carefully for that.\u201d\n\u201cLong life to the \u2018Colonel\u2019 \u201d said the Count smiling.",
    "\u201cAmazing news is it not that he\nmeans to retire To retire Just like a doctor or a butcher or a plumber\u2014\u201d\n\u201cOr any other business man\u201d finished Nadina.",
    "\u201cIt should not surprise us.",
    "That is what the\n\u2018Colonel\u2019 has always been\u2014an excellent man of business.",
    "He has organized crime as\nanother man might organize a boot factory.",
    "Without committing himself he has planned and\ndirected a series of stupendous coups embracing every branch of what we might call his\n\u2018profession.\u2019 Jewel robberies forgery espionage the latter very profitable in wartime\nsabotage discreet assassination there is hardly anything he has not touched.",
    "Wisest of all\nhe knows when to stop.",
    "The game begins to be dangerous\u2014he retires gracefully\u2014with an\nenormous fortune\u201d\n\u201cH\u2019m\u201d said the Count doubtfully.",

    "We are at a loose\nend as it were.\u201d\n\u201cBut we are being paid off\u2014on a most generous scale\u201d\nSomething some undercurrent of mockery in her tone made the man look at her sharply.",
    "She was smiling to herself and the quality of her smile aroused his curiosity.",
    "But he\nproceeded diplomatically\n\u201cYes the \u2018Colonel\u2019 has always been a great paymaster.",
    "I attribute much of his success to\nthat\u2014and to his invariable plan of providing a suitable scapegoat.",
    "A great brain\nundoubtedly a great brain And an apostle of the maxim \u2018If you want a thing done safely do\nnot do it yourself \u2019 Here are we every one of us incriminated up to the hilt and absolutely\n\n\fin his power and not one of us has anything on him.\u201d\nHe paused almost as though he were expecting her to disagree with him but she\nremained silent smiling to herself as before.",
    "\u201cNot one of us\u201d he mused.",
    "\u201cStill you know he is superstitious the old man.",
    "Years ago I\nbelieve he went to one of these fortunetelling people.",
    "She prophesied a lifetime of\nsuccess but declared that his downfall would be brought about through a woman.\u201d\nHe had interested her now.",
    "She looked up eagerly.",
    "\u201cThat is strange very strange Through a woman you say\u201d\nHe smiled and shrugged his shoulders.",
    "\u201cDoubtless now that he has\u2014retired he will marry.",
    "Some young society beauty who\nwill disperse his millions faster than he acquired them.\u201d\nNadina shook her head.",
    "\u201cNo no that is not the way of it.",
    "Listen my friend tomorrow I go to London.\u201d\n\u201cBut your contract here\u201d\n\u201cI shall be away only one night.",
    "And I go incognito like Royalty.",
    "No one will ever know\nthat I have left France.",
    "And why do you think that I go\u201d\n\u201cHardly for pleasure at this time of the year.",
    "January a detestable foggy month It must be\nfor profit eh\u201d\n\u201cExactly.\u201d She rose and stood in front of him every graceful line of her arrogant with\npride.",
    "\u201cYou said just now that none of us had anything on the chief.",
    "You were wrong.",
    "I have.",
    "I a woman have had the wit and yes the courage\u2014for it needs courage\u2014to doublecross\nhim.",
    "You remember the De Beer diamonds\u201d\n\u201cYes I remember.",
    "At Kimberley just before the war broke out I had nothing to do with\nit and I never heard the details the case was hushed up for some reason was it not A fine\nhaul too.\u201d\n\u201cA hundred thousand pounds\u201d worth of stones.",
    "Two of us worked it\u2014under the\n\u2018Colonel\u2019s\u2019 orders of course.",
    "And it was then that I saw my chance.",
    "You see the plan was\nto substitute some of the De Beer diamonds for some sample diamonds brought from South\nAmerica by two young prospectors who happened to be in Kimberley at the time.",
    "Suspicion\nwas then bound to fall on them.\u201d\n\u201cVery clever\u201d interpolated the Count approvingly.",
    "\u201cThe \u2018Colonel\u2019 is always clever.",
    "Well I did my part\u2014but I also did one thing which the\n\u2018Colonel\u2019 had not foreseen.",
    "I kept back some of the South American stones\u2014one or two are\nunique and could easily be proved never to have passed through De Beers\u2019 hands.",
    "With\n\n\fthese diamonds in my possession I have the whiphand of my esteemed chief.",
    "Once the two\nyoung men are cleared his part in the matter is bound to be suspected.",
    "I have said nothing\nall these years I have been content to know that I had this weapon in reverse but now\nmatters are different.",
    "I want my price\u2014and it will be big I might almost say a staggering\nprice.\u201d\n\u201cExtraordinary\u201d said the Count.",
    "\u201cAnd doubtless you carry these diamonds about with you\neverywhere\u201d\nHis eyes roamed gently around the disordered room.",
    "Nadina laughed softly.",
    "\u201cYou need suppose nothing of the sort.",
    "I am not a fool.",
    "The diamonds are in a safe place\nwhere no one will dream of looking for them.\u201d\n\u201cI never thought you a fool my dear lady but may I venture to suggest that you are\nsomewhat foolhardy The \u2018Colonel\u2019 is not the type of man to take kindly to being\nblackmailed you know.\u201d\n\u201cI am not afraid of him\u201d she laughed.",
    "\u201cThere is only one man I have ever feared\u2014and he\nis dead.\u201d\nThe man looked at her curiously.",
    "\u201cLet us hope that he will not come to life again then\u201d he remarked lightly.",
    "\u201cWhat do you mean\u201d cried the dancer sharply.",
    "The Count looked slightly surprised.",
    "\u201cI only meant that resurrection would be awkward for you\u201d he explained.",
    "\u201cA foolish\njoke.\u201d\nShe gave a sigh of relief.",
    "\u201cOh no he is dead all right.",
    "Killed in the war.",
    "He was a man who once\u2014loved me.\u201d\n\u201cIn South Africa\u201d asked the Count negligently.",
    "\u201cYes since you ask it in South Africa.\u201d\n\u201cThat is your native country is it not\u201d\nShe nodded.",
    "Her visitor rose and reached for his hat.",
    "\u201cWell\u201d he remarked \u201cyou know your own business best but if I were you I should fear\nthe \u2018Colonel\u2019 far more than any disillusioned lover.",
    "He is a man whom it is particularly\neasy to\u2014underestimate.\u201d\nShe laughed scornfully.",
    "\u201cAs if I did not know him after all these years\u201d\n\n\f\u201cI wonder if you do\u201d he said softly.",
    "\u201cI very much wonder if you do.\u201d\n\u201cOh I am not a fool And I am not alone in this.",
    "The South African mail boat docks at\nSouthampton tomorrow and on board her is a man who has come specially from Africa at\nmy request and who has carried out certain orders of mine.",
    "The \u2018Colonel\u2019 will have not one\nof us to deal with but two.\u201d\n\u201cIs that wise\u201d\n\u201cIt is necessary.\u201d\n\u201cYou are sure of this man\u201d\nA rather peculiar smile played over the dancer\u2019s face.",
    "\u201cI am quite sure of him.",
    "He is inefficient but perfectly trustworthy.\u201d She paused and then\nadded in an indifferent tone of voice \u201cAs a matter of fact he happens to be my husband.\u201d\n\n\fOne\n\nEverybody has been at me right and left to write this story from the great represented by\nLord Nasby to the small represented by our late maidofallwork Emily whom I saw\nwhen I was last in England.",
    "\u201cLor miss what a beyewtiful book you might make out of it all\n\u2014just like the pictures\u201d\nI\u2019ll admit that I\u2019ve certain qualifications for the task.",
    "I was mixed up in the affair from the\nvery beginning I was in the thick of it all through and I was triumphantly \u201cin at the death.\u201d\nVery fortunately too the gaps that I cannot supply from my own knowledge are amply\ncovered by Sir Eustace Pedler\u2019s diary of which he has kindly begged me to make use.",
    "So here goes.",
    "Anne Beddingfeld starts to narrate her adventures.",
    "I\u2019d always longed for adventures.",
    "You see my life had such a dreadful sameness.",
    "My\nfather Professor Beddingfeld was one of England\u2019s greatest living authorities on Primitive\nMan.",
    "He really was a genius\u2014everyone admits that.",
    "His mind dwelt in Palaeolithic times\nand the inconvenience of life for him was that his body inhabited the modern world.",
    "Papa\ndid not care for modern man\u2014even Neolithic Man he despised as a mere herder of cattle\nand he did not rise to enthusiasm until he reached the Mousterian period.",
    "Unfortunately one cannot entirely dispense with modern men.",
    "One is forced to have some\nkind of truck with butchers and bakers and milkmen and greengrocers.",
    "Therefore Papa\nbeing immersed in the past Mamma having died when I was a baby it fell to me to\nundertake the practical side of living.",
    "Frankly I hate Palaeolithic Man be he Aurignacian\nMousterian Chellian or anything else and though I typed and revised most of Papa\u2019s\nNeanderthal Man and his Ancestors Neanderthal men themselves fill me with loathing\nand I always reflect what a fortunate circumstance it was that they became extinct in remote\nages.",
    "I do not know whether Papa guessed my feelings on the subject probably not and in any\ncase he would not have been interested.",
    "The opinion of other people never interested him in\nthe slightest degree.",
    "I think it was really a sign of his greatness.",
    "In the same way he lived\nquite detached from the necessities of daily life.",
    "He ate what was put before him in an\nexemplary fashion but seemed mildly pained when the question of paying for it arose.",
    "We\nnever seemed to have any money.",
    "His celebrity was not of the kind that brought in a cash\nreturn.",
    "Although he was a fellow of almost every important society and had rows of letters\nafter his name the general public scarcely knew of his existence and his longlearned\nbooks though adding signally to the sum total of human knowledge had no attraction for the\nmasses.",
    "Only on one occasion did he leap into the public gaze.",
    "He had read a paper before\n\n\fsome society on the subject of the young of the chimpanzee.",
    "The young of the human race\nshow some anthropoid features whereas the young of the chimpanzee approach more nearly\nto the human than the adult chimpanzee does.",
    "That seems to show that whereas our ancestors\nwere more Simian than we are the chimpanzee\u2019s were of a higher type than the present\nspecies\u2014in other words the chimpanzee is a degenerate.",
    "That enterprising newspaper the\nDaily Budget being hard up for something spicy immediately brought itself out with large\nheadlines.",
    "\u201cWe are not descended from monkeys but are monkeys descended from us\nEminent Professor says chimpanzees are decadent humans.\u201d Shortly afterwards a reporter\ncalled to see Papa and endeavoured to induce him to write a series of popular articles on\nthe theory.",
    "I have seldom seen Papa so angry.",
    "He turned the reporter out of the house with\nscant ceremony much to my secret sorrow as we were particularly short of money at the\nmoment.",
    "In fact for a moment I meditated running after the young man and informing him that\nmy father had changed his mind and would send the articles in question.",
    "I could easily have\nwritten them myself and the probabilities were that Papa would never have learnt of the\ntransaction not being a reader of the Daily Budget.",
    "However I rejected this course as\nbeing too risky so I merely put on my best hat and went sadly down the village to interview\nour justly irate grocer.",
    "The reporter from the Daily Budget was the only young man who ever came to our house.",
    "There were times when I envied Emily our little servant who \u201cwalked out\u201d whenever\noccasion offered with a large sailor to whom she was affianced.",
    "In between times to \u201ckeep\nher hand in\u201d as she expressed it she walked out with the greengrocer\u2019s young man and the\nchemist\u2019s assistant.",
    "I reflected sadly that I had no one to \u201ckeep my hand in\u201d with.",
    "All Papa\u2019s\nfriends were aged Professors\u2014usually with long beards.",
    "It is true that Professor Peterson\nonce clasped me affectionately and said I had a \u201cneat little waist\u201d and then tried to kiss me.",
    "The phrase alone dated him hopelessly.",
    "No selfrespecting female has had a \u201cneat little\nwaist\u201d since I was in my cradle.",
    "I yearned for adventure for love for romance and I seemed condemned to an existence\nof drab utility.",
    "The village possessed a lending library full of tattered works of fiction and\nI enjoyed perils and lovemaking at second hand and went to sleep dreaming of stern silent\nRhodesians and of strong men who always \u201cfelled their opponent with a single blow.\u201d\nThere was no one in the village who even looked as though they could \u201cfell\u201d an opponent\nwith a single blow or several.",
    "There was the cinema too with a weekly episode of \u201cThe Perils of Pamela.\u201d Pamela was\na magnificent young woman.",
    "Nothing daunted her.",
    "She fell out of aeroplanes adventured in\nsubmarines climbed skyscrapers and crept about in the Underworld without turning a hair.",
    "She was not really clever The Master Criminal of the Underworld caught her each time but\nas he seemed loath to knock her on the head in a simple way and always doomed her to\ndeath in a sewer gas chamber or by some new and marvellous means the hero was always\nable to rescue her at the beginning of the following week\u2019s episode.",
    "I used to come out with\n\n\fmy head in a delirious whirl\u2014and then I would get home and find a notice from the Gas\nCompany threatening to cut us off if the outstanding account was not paid\nAnd yet though I did not suspect it every moment was bringing adventure nearer to me.",
    "It is possible that there are many people in the world who have never heard of the finding\nof an antique skull at the Broken Hill Mine in Northern Rhodesia.",
    "I came down one morning\nto find Papa excited to the point of apoplexy.",
    "He poured out the whole story to me.",
    "\u201cYou understand Anne There are undoubtedly certain resemblances to the Java skull\nbut superficial\u2014superficial only.",
    "No here we have what I have always maintained\u2014the\nancestral form of the Neanderthal race.",
    "You grant that the Gibraltar skull is the most\nprimitive of the Neanderthal skulls found Why The cradle of the race was in Africa.",
    "They\npassed to Europe\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNot marmalade on kippers Papa\u201d I said hastily arresting my parent\u2019s absentminded\nhand.",
    "\u201cYes you were saying\u201d\n\u201cThey passed to Europe on\u2014\u201d\nHere he broke down with a bad fit of choking the result of an immoderate mouthful of\nkipper bones.",
    "\u201cBut we must start at once\u201d he declared as he rose to his feet at the conclusion of the\nmeal.",
    "\u201cThere is no time to be lost.",
    "We must be on the spot\u2014there are doubtless incalculable\nfinds to be found in the neighbourhood.",
    "I shall be interested to note whether the implements\nare typical of the Mousterian period\u2014there will be the remains of the primitive ox I should\nsay but not those of the woolly rhinoceros.",
    "Yes a little army will be starting soon.",
    "We must\nget ahead of them.",
    "You will write to Cook\u2019s today Anne\u201d\n\u201cWhat about money Papa\u201d I hinted delicately.",
    "He turned a reproachful eye upon me.",
    "\u201cYour point of view always depresses me my child.",
    "We must not be sordid.",
    "No no in\nthe cause of science one must not be sordid.\u201d\n\u201cI feel Cook\u2019s might be sordid Papa.\u201d\nPapa looked pained.",
    "\u201cMy dear Anne you will pay them in ready money.\u201d\n\u201cI haven\u2019t got any ready money.\u201d\nPapa looked thoroughly exasperated.",
    "\u201cMy child I really cannot be bothered with these vulgar money details.",
    "The bank\u2014I had\nsomething from the Manager yesterday saying I had twentyseven pounds.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s your overdraft I fancy.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cAh I have it Write to my publishers.\u201d\nI acquiesced doubtfully Papa\u2019s books bringing in more glory than money.",
    "I liked the idea\nof going to Rhodesia immensely.",
    "\u201cStern silent men\u201d I murmured to myself in an ecstasy.",
    "Then something in my parent\u2019s appearance struck me as unusual.",
    "\u201cYou have odd boots on Papa\u201d I said.",
    "\u201cTake off the brown one and put on the other\nblack one.",
    "And don\u2019t forget your muffler.",
    "It\u2019s a very cold day.\u201d\nIn a few minutes Papa stalked off correctly booted and wellmufflered.",
    "He returned late that evening and to my dismay I saw his muffler and overcoat were\nmissing.",
    "\u201cDear me Anne you are quite right.",
    "I took them off to go into the cavern.",
    "One gets so\ndirty there.\u201d\nI nodded feelingly remembering an occasion when Papa had returned literally plastered\nfrom head to foot with rich Pleistocene clay.",
    "Our principal reason for settling in Little Hampsley had been the neighbourhood of\nHampsley Cavern a buried cave rich in deposits of the Aurignacian culture.",
    "We had a tiny\nmuseum in the village and the curator and Papa spent most of their days messing about\nunderground and bringing to light portions of woolly rhinoceros and cave bear.",
    "Papa coughed badly all the evening and the following morning I saw he had a\ntemperature and sent for the doctor.",
    "Poor Papa he never had a chance.",
    "It was double pneumonia.",
    "He died four days later.",
    "Two\n\nEveryone was very kind to me.",
    "Dazed as I was I appreciated that.",
    "I felt no overwhelming\ngrief.",
    "Papa had never loved me.",
    "I knew that well enough.",
    "If he had I might have loved him\nin return.",
    "No there had not been love between us but we had belonged together and I had\nlooked after him and had secretly admired his learning and his uncompromising devotion to\nscience.",
    "And it hurt me that Papa should have died just when the interest of life was at its\nheight for him.",
    "I should have felt happier if I could have buried him in a cave with paintings\nof reindeer and flint implements but the force of public opinion constrained a neat tomb\nwith marble slab in our hideous local churchyard.",
    "The vicar\u2019s consolations though wellmeant did not console me in the least.",
    "It took some time to dawn upon me that the thing I had always longed for\u2014freedom\u2014was\nat last mine.",
    "I was an orphan and practically penniless but free.",
    "At the same time I realized\nthe extraordinary kindness of all these good people.",
    "The vicar did his best to persuade me\nthat his wife was in urgent need of a companion help.",
    "Our tiny local library suddenly made\nup its mind to have an assistant librarian.",
    "Finally the doctor called upon me and after\nmaking various ridiculous excuses for failing to send a proper bill he hummed and hawed a\ngood deal and suddenly suggested I should marry him.",
    "I was very much astonished.",
    "The doctor was nearer forty than thirty and a round tubby\nlittle man.",
    "He was not at all like the hero of \u201cThe Perils of Pamela\u201d and even less like the\nstern and silent Rhodesian.",
    "I reflected a minute and then asked why he wanted to marry me.",
    "That seemed to fluster him a good deal and he murmured that a wife was a great help to a\ngeneral practitioner.",
    "The position seemed even more unromantic than before and yet\nsomething in me urged towards its acceptance.",
    "Safety that was what I was being offered.",
    "Safety\u2014and a Comfortable Home.",
    "Thinking it over now I believe I did the little man an\ninjustice.",
    "He was honestly in love with me but a mistaken delicacy prevented him from\npressing his suit on those lines.",

    "\u201cBut it\u2019s impossible.",
    "I could never marry a man\nunless I loved him madly.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t think\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNo I don\u2019t\u201d I said firmly.",
    "He sighed.",
    "\u201cBut my dear child what do you propose to do\u201d\n\u201cHave adventures and see the world\u201d I replied without the least hesitation.",
    "\u201cMiss Anne you are very much a child still.",

    "She had been strangled with a piece of stout black cord and had evidently been\ncaught unawares with no time to cry out.",

    "The victim of the accident the Moth Ball man as I called him to myself  and the foreign\nwoman Mrs. de Castina or whatever her real name was had had an assignation to meet at\nthe Mill House.",
    "That was how I pieced the thing together.",
    "Either because they feared they\nwere being watched or for some other reason they chose the rather ingenious method of\nboth getting an order to view the same house.",
    "Thus their meeting there might have the\nappearance of pure chance.",
    "That the Moth Ball man had suddenly caught sight of the \u201cdoctor\u201d and that the meeting\nwas totally unexpected and alarming to him was another fact of which I was fairly sure.",
    "What had happened next The \u201cdoctor\u201d had removed his disguise and followed the woman\nto Marlow.",
    "But it was possible that had he removed it rather hastily traces of spirit gum\n\n\fmight still linger on his chin.",
    "Hence my question to Mrs. James.",
    "Whilst occupied with my thoughts I had arrived at the low oldfashioned door of the Mill\nHouse.",
    "Unlocking it with the key I passed inside.",
    "The hall was low and dark the place\nsmelt forlorn and mildewy.",
    "In spite of myself I shivered.",
    "Did the woman who had come\nhere \u201csmiling to herself\u201d a few days ago feel no chill of premonition as she entered this\nhouse I wondered.",
    "Did the smile fade from her lips and did a nameless dread close round\nher heart Or had she gone upstairs smiling still unconscious of the doom that was so soon\nto overtake her My heart beat a little faster.",
    "Was the house really empty Was doom\nwaiting for me in it also For the first time I understood the meaning of the muchused\nword \u201catmosphere.\u201d There was an atmosphere in this house an atmosphere of cruelty of\nmenace of evil.",
    "Seven\n\nShaking off the feelings that oppressed me I went quickly upstairs.",
    "I had no difficulty in\nfinding the room of the tragedy.",
    "On the day the body was discovered it had rained heavily\nand large muddy boots had trampled the uncarpeted floor in every direction.",
    "I wondered if\nthe murderer had left any footmarks the previous day.",
    "It was likely that the police would be\nreticent on the subject if he had but on consideration I decided it was unlikely.",
    "The weather\nhad been fine and dry.",
    "There was nothing of interest about the room.",
    "It was almost square with two big bay\nwindows plain white walls and a bare floor the boards being stained round the edges\nwhere the carpet had ceased.",
    "I searched it carefully but there was not so much as a pin\nlying about.",
    "The gifted young detective did not seem likely to discover a neglected clue.",
    "I had brought with me a pencil and notebook.",
    "There did not seem much to note but I duly\ndotted down a brief sketch of the room to cover my disappointment at the failing of my\nquest.",
    "As I was in the act of returning the pencil to my bag it slipped from my fingers and\nrolled along the floor.",
    "The Mill House was really old and the floors were very uneven.",
    "The pencil rolled\nsteadily with increasing momentum until it came to rest under one of the windows.",
    "In the\nrecess of each window there was a broad window seat underneath which there was a\ncupboard.",
    "My pencil was lying right against the cupboard door.",
    "The cupboard was shut but\nit suddenly occurred to me that if it had been open my pencil would have rolled inside.",
    "I\nopened the door and my pencil immediately rolled in and sheltered modestly in the farthest\ncorner.",
    "I retrieved it noting as I did so that owing to lack of light and the peculiar formation\nof the cupboard one could not see it but had to feel for it.",
    "Apart from my pencil the\ncupboard was empty but being thorough by nature I tried the one under the opposite\nwindow.",
    "At first sight it looked as though that also was empty but I grubbed about perseveringly\nand was rewarded by feeling my hand close on a hard paper cylinder which lay in a sort of\ntrough or depression in the far corner of the cupboard.",
    "As soon as I had it in my hand I\nknew what it was.",
    "A roll of Kodak films.",
    "Here was a find\nI realized of course that these films might very well be an old roll belonging to Sir\nEustace Pedler which had rolled in here and had not been found when the cupboard was\nemptied.",
    "But I did not think so.",
    "The red paper was far too freshlooking.",

    "Had it been there for any length of time it would have been thicklycoated.",
    "Who had dropped it The woman or the man I remembered that the contents of her\nhandbag had appeared to be intact.",
    "If it had been jerked open in the struggle and the roll of\nfilms had fallen out surely some of the loose money would have been scattered about also\nNo it was not the woman who had dropped the films.",
    "I sniffed suddenly and suspiciously.",
    "Was the smell of mothballs becoming an obsession\nwith me I could swear that the roll of films smelt of it also.",
    "I held them under my nose.",
    "They had as usual a strong smell of their own but apart from that I could clearly detect the\nodour I disliked so much.",
    "I soon found the cause.",
    "A minute thread of cloth had caught on a\nrough edge of the centre wood and that shred was strongly impregnated with mothballs.",
    "At\nsome time or another the films had been carried in the overcoat pocket of the man who was\nkilled in the Tube.",
    "Was it he who had dropped them here Hardly.",
    "His movements were all\naccounted for.",
    "No it was the other man the \u201cdoctor.\u201d He had taken the films when he had taken the\npaper.",
    "It was he who had dropped them here during his struggle with the woman.",
    "I had got my clue I would have the roll developed and then I would have further\ndevelopments to work upon.",
    "Very elated I left the house returned the keys to Mrs. James and made my way as quickly\nas possible to the station.",
    "On the way back to town I took out my paper and studied it\nafresh.",
    "Suddenly the figures took on a new significance.",
    "Suppose they were a date 17 1 22.",
    "The 17th of January 1922.",
    "Surely that must be it Idiot that I was not to have thought of it\nbefore.",
    "But in that case I must find out the whereabouts of Kilmorden Castle for today was\nactually the 14th.",
    "Three days.",
    "Little enough\u2014almost hopeless when one had no idea of\nwhere to look\nIt was too late to hand in my roll today.",
    "I had to hurry home to Kensington so as not to be\nlate for dinner.",
    "It occurred to me that there was an easy way of verifying whether some of\nmy conclusions were correct.",
    "I asked Mr. Flemming whether there had been a camera\namongst the dead man\u2019s belongings.",
    "I knew that he had taken an interest in the case and was\nconversant with all the details.",
    "To my surprise and annoyance he replied that there had been no camera.",
    "All Carton\u2019s\neffects had been gone over very carefully in the hopes of finding something that might throw\nlight upon his state of mind.",
    "He was positive that there had been no photographic apparatus\nof any kind.",
    "That was rather a setback to my theory.",
    "If he had no camera why should he be carrying a\nroll of films\nI set out early next morning to take my precious roll to be developed.",
    "I was so fussy that I\nwent all the way to Regent Street to the big Kodak place.",
    "I handed it in and asked for a print\nof each film.",
    "The man finished stacking together a heap of films packed in yellow tin\n\n\fcylinders for the tropics and picked up my roll.",
    "He looked at me.",
    "\u201cYou\u2019ve made a mistake I think\u201d he said smiling.",
    "\u201cOh no\u201d I said.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m sure I haven\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve given me the wrong roll.",
    "This is an unexposed one.\u201d\nI walked out with what dignity I could muster.",
    "I dare say it is good for one now and again\nto realize what an idiot one can be But nobody relishes the process.",
    "And then just as I was passing one of the big shipping offices I came to a sudden halt.",
    "In\nthe window was a beautiful model of one of the company\u2019s boats and it was labelled\n\u201cKenilworth Castle.\u201d A wild idea shot through my brain.",
    "I pushed the door open and went\nin.",
    "I went up to the counter and in a faltering voice genuine this time I murmured\n\u201cKilmorden Castle\u201d\n\u201cOn the 17th from Southampton.",
    "Cape Town First or second class\u201d\n\u201cHow much is it\u201d\n\u201cFirst class eightyseven pounds\u2014\u201d\nI interrupted him.",
    "The coincidence was too much for me.",

    "I like\nEngland in the summer and the Riviera in the winter.",
    "I have no desire to participate in\nsensational happenings.",
    "Sometimes in front of a good fire I do not object to reading\nabout them in the newspaper.",
    "But that is as far as I am willing to go.",
    "My object in life is\nto be thoroughly comfortable.",
    "I have devoted a certain amount of thought and a\nconsiderable amount of money to further that end.",
    "But I cannot say that I always\nsucceed.",
    "If things do not actually happen to me they happen round me and frequently in\nspite of myself I become involved.",
    "I hate being involved.",
    "All this because Guy Pagett came into my bedroom this morning with a telegram in his\nhand and a face as long as a mute at a funeral.",
    "Guy Pagett is my secretary a zealous painstaking hardworking fellow admirable in\nevery respect.",
    "I know no one who annoys me more.",
    "For a long time I have been racking\nmy brains as to how to get rid of him.",
    "But you cannot very well dismiss a secretary\nbecause he prefers work to play likes getting up early in the morning and has positively\nno vices.",
    "The only amusing thing about the fellow is his face.",
    "He has the face of a\nfourteenthcentury poisoner\u2014the sort of man the Borgias got to do their odd jobs for\nthem.",
    "I wouldn\u2019t mind so much if Pagett didn\u2019t make me work too.",
    "My idea of work is\nsomething that should be undertaken lightly and airily\u2014trifled with in fact I doubt if\nGuy Pagett has ever trifled with anything in his life.",
    "He takes everything seriously.",
    "That\nis what makes him so difficult to live with.",
    "Last week I had the brilliant idea of sending him off to Florence.",
    "He talked about\nFlorence and how much he wanted to go there.",
    "\u201cMy dear fellow\u201d I cried \u201cYou shall go tomorrow.",
    "I will pay all your expenses.\u201d\nJanuary isn\u2019t the usual time for going to Florence but it would be all one to Pagett.",
    "I\ncould imagine him going about guidebook in hand religiously doing all the picture\ngalleries.",
    "And a week\u2019s freedom was cheap to me at the price.",
    "It has been a delightful week.",
    "I have done everything I wanted to and nothing that I\ndid not want to do.",
    "But when I blinked my eyes open and perceived Pagett standing\nbetween me and the light at the unearthly hour of 9 am this morning I realized that\nfreedom was over.",
    "\u201cMy dear fellow\u201d I said \u201chas the funeral already taken place or is it for later in the\nmorning\u201d\nPagett does not appreciate dry humour.",
    "He merely stared.",
    "\u201cSo you know Sir Eustace\u201d\n\u201cKnow what\u201d I said crossly.",
    "\u201cFrom the expression on your face I inferred that one of\nyour near and dear relatives was to be interred this morning.\u201d\nPagett ignored the sally as far as possible.",

    "\u201cWhat is that thing\u201d I asked.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s a telegram from the police at Marlow.",
    "A woman has been murdered in your\nhouse.\u201d\nThat aroused me in earnest.",
    "\u201cWhat colossal cheek\u201d I exclaimed.",
    "\u201cWhy in my house Who murdered her\u201d\n\u201cThey don\u2019t say.",
    "I suppose we shall go back to England at once Sir Eustace\u201d\n\u201cYou need suppose nothing of the kind.",
    "Why should we go back\u201d\n\u201cThe police\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWhat on earth have I to do with the police\u201d\n\u201cWell it is your house.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u201d I said \u201cappears to be more my misfortune than my fault.\u201d\nGuy Pagett shook his head gloomily.",
    "\u201cIt will have a very unfortunate effect upon the constituency\u201d he remarked\nlugubriously.",
    "I don\u2019t see why it should have\u2014and yet I have a feeling that in such matters Pagett\u2019s\ninstincts are always right.",
    "On the face of it a Member of Parliament will be none the less\nefficient because a stray young woman comes and gets herself murdered in an empty\nhouse that belongs to him\u2014but there is no accounting for the view the respectable\nBritish public takes of a matter.",
    "\u201cShe\u2019s a foreigner too and that makes it worse\u201d continued Pagett gloomily.",
    "Again I believe he is right.",
    "If it is disreputable to have a woman murdered in your\nhouse it becomes more disreputable if the woman is a foreigner.",
    "Another idea struck me.",
    "\u201cGood heavens\u201d I exclaimed \u201cI hope this won\u2019t upset Caroline.\u201d\nCaroline is the lady who cooks for me.",
    "Incidentally she is the wife of my gardener.",
    "What kind of a wife she makes I do not know but she is an excellent cook.",
    "James on the\nother hand is not a good gardener\u2014but I support him in idleness and give him the lodge\nto live in solely on account of Caroline\u2019s cooking.",
    "\u201cI don\u2019t suppose she\u2019ll stay after this\u201d said Pagett.",
    "\u201cYou always were a cheerful fellow\u201d I said.",
    "I expect I shall have to go back to England.",
    "Pagett clearly intends that I shall.",
    "And\nthere is Caroline to pacify.",
    "Three days later.",
    "It is incredible to me that anyone who can get away from England in winter does not do\nso It is an abominable climate.",
    "All this trouble is very annoying.",
    "The house agents say it\nwill be next to impossible to let the Mill House after all the publicity.",
    "Caroline has been\npacified\u2014with double pay.",
    "We could have sent her a cable to that effect from Cannes.",
    "In\nfact as I have said all along there was no earthly purpose to serve by our coming over.",
    "I\nshall go back tomorrow.",
    "One day later.",
    "Several very suprising things have occurred.",
    "To begin with I met Augustus Milray the\nmost perfect example of an old ass the present Government has produced.",
    "His manner\noozed diplomatic secrecy as he drew me aside in the Club into a quiet corner.",
    "He talked\na good deal.",
    "About South Africa and the industrial situation there.",
    "About the growing\nrumours of a strike on the Rand.",
    "Of the secret causes actuating that strike.",
    "I listened as\npatiently as I could.",
    "Finally he dropped his voice to a whisper and explained that\ncertain documents had come to light which ought to be placed in the hands of General\nSmuts.",
    "\u201cI\u2019ve no doubt you\u2019re quite right\u201d I said stifling a yawn.",
    "\u201cBut how are we to get them to him Our position in the matter is delicate\u2014very\ndelicate.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with the post\u201d I said cheerfully.",
    "\u201cPut a twopenny stamp on and drop\n\u2019em in the nearest letter box.\u201d\nHe seemed quite shocked at the suggestion.",
    "\u201cMy dear Pedler The common post\u201d\nIt has always been a mystery to me why Governments employ King\u2019s Messengers and\ndraw such attention to their confidential documents.",
    "\u201cIf you don\u2019t like the post send one of your own young fellows.",
    "He\u2019ll enjoy the trip.\u201d\n\u201cImpossible\u201d said Milray wagging his head in a senile fashion.",
    "\u201cThere are reasons\nmy dear Pedler\u2014I assure you there are reasons.\u201d\n\u201cWell\u201d I said rising \u201call this is very interesting but I must be off\u2014\u201d\n\u201cOne minute my dear Pedler one minute I beg of you.",
    "Now tell me in confidence is\nit not true that you intend visiting South Africa shortly yourself You have large interests\nin Rhodesia I know and the question of Rhodesia joining in the Union is one in which\nyou have a vital interest.\u201d\n\u201cWell I had thought of going out in about a month\u2019s time.\u201d\n\u201cYou couldn\u2019t possibly make it sooner This month This week in fact\u201d\n\u201cI could\u201d I said eyeing him with some interest.",
    "\u201cBut I don\u2019t know that I particularly\nwant to.\u201d\n\u201cYou would be doing the Government a great service\u2014a very great service.",

    "Your position is an unofficial one your journey is bona fide.",
    "Everything\nwould be eminently satisfactory.\u201d\n\u201cWell\u201d I said slowly \u201cI don\u2019t mind if I do.",
    "The one thing I am anxious to do is to get\nout of England again as soon as possible.\u201d\n\u201cYou will find the climate of South Africa delightful\u2014quite delightful.\u201d\n\u201cMy dear fellow I know all about the climate.",
    "I was out there shortly before the war.\u201d\n\u201cI am really much obliged to you Pedler.",
    "I will send you round the package by\nmessenger.",
    "To be placed in General Smuts\u2019s own hands you understand The Kilmorden\nCastle sails on Saturday\u2014quite a good boat.\u201d\nI accompanied him a short way along Pall Mall before we parted.",
    "He shook me\nwarmly by the hand and thanked me again effusively.",
    "I walked home reflecting on the\ncurious byways of Governmental policy.",
    "It was the following evening that Jarvis my butler informed me that a gentleman\nwished to see me on private business but declined to give his name.",
    "I have always a\nlively apprehension of insurance touts so told Jarvis to say I could not see him.",
    "Guy\nPagett unfortunately when he might for once have been of real use was laid up with a\nbilious attack.",
    "These earnest hardworking young men with weak stomachs are always\nliable to bilious attacks.",
    "Jarvis returned.",
    "\u201cThe gentleman asked me to tell you Sir Eustace that he comes to you from Mr.\nMilray.\u201d\nThat altered the complexion of things.",
    "A few minutes later I was confronting my visitor\nin the library.",
    "He was a wellbuilt young fellow with a deeply tanned face.",
    "A scar ran\ndiagonally from the corner of his eye to the jaw disfiguring what would otherwise have\nbeen a handsome though somewhat reckless countenance.",
    "\u201cWell\u201d I said \u201cwhat\u2019s the matter\u201d\n\u201cMr.",
    "Milray sent me to you Sir Eustace.",
    "I am to accompany you to South Africa as\nyour secretary.\u201d\n\u201cMy dear fellow\u201d I said \u201cI\u2019ve got a secretary already.",

    "Where is your secretary now\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s down with a bilious attack\u201d I explained.",

    "He\u2019s subject to them.\u201d\nMy visitor smiled.",
    "\u201cIt may or may not be a bilious attack.",
    "Time will show.",
    "But I can tell you this Sir\nEustace Mr. Milray would not be surprised if an attempt were made to get your\nsecretary out of the way.",
    "Oh you need have no fear for yourself\u201d\u2014I suppose a\nmomentary alarm had flickered across my face\u2014\u201cyou are not threatened.",
    "Your secretary\nout of the way access to you would be easier.",
    "In any case Mr. Milray wishes me to\naccompany you.",
    "The passage money will be our affair of course but you will take the\nnecessary steps about the passport as though you had decided that you needed the\nservices of a second secretary.\u201d\nHe seemed a determined young man.",
    "We stared at each other and he stared me down.",
    "\u201cVery well\u201d I said feebly.",
    "\u201cYou will say nothing to anyone as to my accompanying you.\u201d\n\u201cVery well\u201d I said again.",
    "After all perhaps it was better to have this fellow with me but I had a premonition\nthat I was getting into deep waters.",

    "\u201cIt might be just as well if I knew my new secretary\u2019s name\u201d I observed sarcastically.",
    "He considered for a minute.",
    "\u201cHarry Rayburn seems quite a suitable name\u201d he observed.",

    "I regret to say that at the first roll the\nKilmorden gave I turned pale and hastened below.",
    "A sympathetic stewardess received me.",
    "She suggested dry toast and ginger ale.",
    "I remained groaning in my cabin for three days.",
    "Forgotten was my quest.",
    "I had no longer\nany interest in solving mysteries.",

    "Mrs. Flemming was\nalone there.",
    "She turned her head as I entered.",

    "She didn\u2019t want me I knew.",
    "It was sheer Christian charity that prompted\nthe offer.",

    "\u201cA dear a dear a dear And thank you ever so much.",
    "But it\u2019s all\nright I\u2019m off to South Africa on Saturday.\u201d\nMy abrupt onslaught had startled the good lady.",

    "We would have to look into anything of that kind very\ncarefully.\u201d\nThat was the last thing I wanted.",
    "I explained that I had already taken my passage and that\nupon arrival I proposed to take up duties as a parlourmaid.",
    "It was the only thing I could\nthink of on the spur of the moment.",
    "There was I said a great demand for parlourmaids in\nSouth Africa.",
    "I assured her that I was equal to taking care of myself and in the end with a\nsigh of relief at getting me off her hands she accepted the project without further query.",
    "At\nparting she slipped an envelope into my hand.",
    "Inside it I found five new crisp fivepound\n\n\fnotes and the words \u201cI hope you will not be offended and will accept this with my love.\u201d\nShe was a very good kind woman.",
    "I could not have continued to live in the same house with\nher but I did recognize her intrinsic worth.",
    "So here I was with twentyfive pounds in my pocket facing the world and pursuing my\nadventure.",
    "It was on the fourth day that the stewardess finally urged me up on deck.",
    "Under the\nimpression that I should die quicker below I had steadfastly refused to leave my bunk.",
    "She\nnow tempted me with the advent of Madeira.",
    "Hope rose in my breast.",
    "I could leave the boat\nand go ashore and be a parlourmaid there.",
    "Anything for dry land.",
    "Muffled in coats and rugs and weak as a kitten on my legs I was hauled up and\ndeposited an inert mass on a deck chair.",
    "I lay there with my eyes closed hating life.",
    "The\npurser a fairhaired young man with a round boyish face came and sat down beside me.",
    "\u201cHullo Feeling rather sorry for yourself eh\u201d\n\u201cYes\u201d I replied hating him.",
    "\u201cAh you won\u2019t know yourself in another day or two.",
    "We\u2019ve had a rather nasty dusting in\nthe Bay but there\u2019s smooth weather ahead.",
    "I\u2019ll be taking you on at quoits tomorrow.\u201d\nI did not reply.",
    "\u201cThink you\u2019ll never recover eh But I\u2019ve seen people much worse than you and two\ndays later they were the life and soul of the ship.",
    "You\u2019ll be the same.\u201d\nI did not feel sufficiently pugnacious to tell him outright that he was a liar.",
    "I endeavoured\nto convey it by a glance.",
    "He chatted pleasantly for a few minutes more then he mercifully\ndeparted.",
    "People passed and repassed brisk couples \u201cexercising\u201d curveting children\nlaughing young people.",
    "A few other pallid sufferers lay like myself in deck chairs.",
    "The air was pleasant crisp not too cold and the sun was shining brightly.",
    "Insensibly I\nfelt a little cheered.",
    "I began to watch the people.",
    "One woman in particular attracted me.",
    "She\nwas about thirty of medium height and very fair with a round dimpled face and very blue\neyes.",
    "Her clothes though perfectly plain had that indefinable air of \u201ccut\u201d about them which\nspoke of Paris.",
    "Also in a pleasant but selfpossessed way she seemed to own the ship\nDeck stewards ran to and fro obeying her commands.",
    "She had a special deck chair and\nan apparently inexhaustible supply of cushions.",
    "She changed her mind three times as to\nwhere she would like it placed.",
    "Throughout everything she remained attractive and\ncharming.",
    "She appeared to be one of those rare people in the world who know what they\nwant see that they get it and manage to do so without being offensive.",
    "I decided that if ever\nI recovered\u2014but of course I shouldn\u2019t\u2014it would amuse me to talk to her.",
    "We reached Madeira about midday.",
    "I was still too inert to move but I enjoyed the\npicturesquelooking merchants who came on board and spread their merchandise about the\n\n\fdecks.",
    "There were flowers too.",
    "I buried my nose in an enormous bunch of sweet wet violets\nand felt distinctly better.",
    "In fact I thought I might just possibly last out the end of the voyage.",
    "When my stewardess spoke of the attractions of a little chicken broth I only protested\nfeebly.",
    "When it came I enjoyed it.",
    "My attractive woman had been ashore.",
    "She came back escorted by a tall soldierlylooking man with dark hair and a bronzed face whom I had noticed striding up and down the\ndeck earlier in the day.",
    "I put him down at once as one of the strong silent men of Rhodesia.",
    "He was about forty with a touch of greying hair at either temple and was easily the bestlooking man on board.",
    "When the stewardess brought me up an extra rug I asked her if she knew who my\nattractive woman was.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s a wellknown society lady the Hon.",
    "Mrs. Clarence Blair.",
    "You must have read\nabout her in the papers.\u201d\nI nodded looking at her with renewed interest.",
    "Mrs. Blair was very wellknown indeed\nas one of the smartest women of the day.",
    "I observed with some amusement that she was the\ncentre of a good deal of attention.",
    "Several people essayed to scrape acquaintance with the\npleasant informality that a boat allows.",

    "She appeared to have adopted the strong silent man as her special cavalier and he\nseemed duly sensible of the privilege accorded him.",

    "\u201cFeeling better this morning\u201d\nI thanked her and said I felt slightly more like a human being.",
    "\u201cYou did look ill yesterday.",

    "\u201cYou\u2019ve got an\noutside one I hope\u201d\nI shook my head.",
    "\u201cMy dear girl Why don\u2019t you change There\u2019s plenty of room.",
    "A lot of people got off at\nMadeira and the boat\u2019s very empty.",
    "Talk to the purser about it.",
    "He\u2019s a nice little boy\u2014he\nchanged me into a beautiful cabin because I didn\u2019t care for the one I\u2019d got.",

    "Come and take a walk now with me.\u201d\nShe dimpled at me encouragingly.",
    "I felt very weak on my legs at first but as we walked\nbriskly up and down I began to feel a brighter and better being.",
    "After a turn or two Colonel Race joined us again.",
    "\u201cYou can see the Grand Peak of Tenerife from the other side.\u201d\n\u201cCan we Can I get a photograph of it do you think\u201d\n\u201cNo\u2014but that won\u2019t deter you from snapping off at it.\u201d\nMrs. Blair laughed.",
    "\u201cYou are unkind.",
    "Some of my photographs are very good.\u201d\n\u201cAbout three percent effective I should say.\u201d\nWe all went round to the other side of the deck.",
    "There glimmering white and snowy\nenveloped in a delicate rosecoloured mist rose the glistening pinnacle.",
    "I uttered an\nexclamation of delight.",

    "\u201cHow horrid you are\u2014but I\u2019ve got another roll.\u201d\nShe produced it in triumph from the pocket of her sweater.",
    "A sudden roll of the boat upset\nher balance and as she caught at the rail to steady herself the roll of films flashed over the\nside.",
    "\u201cOh\u201d cried Mrs. Blair comically dismayed.",

    "\u201cDo you think they have\ngone overboard\u201d\n\u201cNo you may have been fortunate enough to brain an unlucky steward in the deck below.\u201d\nA small boy who had arrived unobserved a few paces to our rear blew a deafening blast\non a bugle.",

    "On the other side of the Captain was a distinguishedlooking greyhaired\nman.",
    "A good many people I had already noticed on deck but there was one man who had\nnot previously appeared.",
    "Had he done so he could hardly have escaped my notice.",
    "He was\ntall and dark and had such a peculiarly sinister type of countenance that I was quite startled.",
    "I asked the purser with some curiosity who he was.",
    "\u201cThat man Oh that\u2019s Sir Eustace Pedler\u2019s secretary.",
    "Been very seasick poor chap and\nnot appeared before.",
    "Sir Eustace has got two secretaries with him and the sea\u2019s been too\nmuch for both of them.",
    "The other fellow hasn\u2019t turned up yet.",
    "This man\u2019s name is Pagett.\u201d\nSo Sir Eustace Pedler the owner of the Mill House was on board.",
    "Probably only a\ncoincidence and yet\u2014\n\u201cThat\u2019s Sir Eustace\u201d my informant continued \u201csitting next to the Captain.",
    "Pompous old\nass.\u201d\nThe more I studied the secretary\u2019s face the less I liked it.",
    "Its even pallor the secretive\nheavylidded eyes the curiously flattened head\u2014it all gave a feeling of distaste of\napprehension.",
    "Leaving the saloon at the same time as he did I was close behind him as he went up on\ndeck.",
    "He was speaking to Sir Eustace and I overheard a fragment or two.",
    "\u201cI\u2019ll see about the cabin at once then shall I It\u2019s impossible to work in yours with all\nyour trunks.\u201d\n\u201cMy dear fellow\u201d Sir Eustace replied.",
    "\u201cMy cabin is intended a for me to sleep in and\nb to attempt to dress in.",
    "I never had any intentions of allowing you to sprawl about the\nplace making an infernal clicking with that typewriter of yours.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s just what I say Sir Eustace we must have somewhere to work\u2014\u201d\nHere I parted company from them and went below to see if my removal was in progress.",
    "I found my steward busy at the task.",
    "\u201cVery nice cabin miss.",
    "On D deck.",
    "No.",
    "13.\u201d\n\u201cOh no\u201d I cried.",
    "\u201cNot 13.\u201d\n\n\f13 is the one thing I am superstitious about.",
    "It was a nice cabin too.",
    "I inspected it\nwavered but a foolish superstition prevailed.",
    "I appealed almost tearfully to the steward.",
    "\u201cIsn\u2019t there any other cabin I can have\u201d\nThe steward reflected.",
    "\u201cWell there\u2019s 17 just along the starboard side.",
    "That was empty this morning but I rather\nfancy it\u2019s been allotted to someone.",
    "Still as the gentleman\u2019s things aren\u2019t in yet and as\ngentlemen aren\u2019t anything like so superstitious as ladies I daresay he wouldn\u2019t mind\nchanging.\u201d\nI hailed the proposition gratefully and the steward departed to obtain permission from\nthe purser.",
    "He returned grinning.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s all right miss.",
    "We can go along.\u201d\nHe led the way to 17.",
    "It was not quite as large as No.",
    "13 but I found it eminently\nsatisfactory.",
    "\u201cI\u2019ll fetch your things right away miss\u201d said the steward.",
    "But at that moment the man with the sinister face as I had nicknamed him appeared in\nthe doorway.",
    "\u201cExcuse me\u201d he said \u201cbut this cabin is reserved for the use of Sir Eustace Pedler.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s all right sir\u201d explained the steward.",
    "\u201cWe\u2019re fitting up No.",
    "13 instead.\u201d\n\u201cNo it was No.",
    "17 I was to have.\u201d\n\u201cNo.",

    "17 and the purser said I could have it.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d I said coldly.",
    "\u201cBut No.",
    "17 has been allotted to me.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t agree to that.\u201d\nThe steward put in his oar.",

    "17.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s all this\u201d demanded a new voice.",
    "\u201cSteward put my things in here.",
    "This is my\ncabin.\u201d\nIt was my neighbour at lunch the Rev.",

    "\u201cI beg your pardon\u201d I said.",

    "We were all getting rather heated.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m sorry to have to dispute the matter\u201d said Chichester with a meek smile which failed\nto mask his determination to get his own way.",
    "Meek men are always obstinate I have\nnoticed.",
    "He edged himself sideways into the doorway.",
    "\u201cYou\u2019re to have No.",
    "28 on the port side\u201d said the steward.",
    "\u201cA very good cabin sir.\u201d\n\u201cI am afraid that I must insist.",
    "No.",
    "17 was the cabin promised to me.\u201d\nWe had come to an impasse.",
    "Each one of us was determined not to give way.",
    "Strictly\nspeaking I at any rate might have retired from the contest and eased matters by offering to\naccept Cabin 28.",
    "So long as I did not have 13 it was immaterial to me what other cabin I\nhad.",
    "But my blood was up.",
    "I had not the least intention of being the first to give way.",
    "And I\ndisliked Chichester.",
    "He had false teeth that clicked when he ate.",
    "Many men have been hated\nfor less.",
    "We all said the same things over again.",
    "The steward assured us even more strongly that\nboth the other cabins were better cabins.",
    "None of us paid any attention to him.",
    "Pagett began to lose his temper.",
    "Chichester kept his serenely.",
    "With an effort I also kept\nmine.",
    "And still none of us would give way an inch.",
    "A wink and a whispered word from the steward gave me my cue.",
    "I faded unobtrusively\nfrom the scene.",
    "I was lucky enough to encounter the purser almost immediately.",
    "\u201cOh please\u201d I said \u201cyou did say I could have cabin 17 And the others won\u2019t go away.",
    "Mr. Chichester and Mr. Pagett.",
    "You will let me have it won\u2019t you\u201d\nI always say that there are no people like sailors for being nice to women.",
    "My little\npurser came to scratch splendidly.",
    "He strode to the scene informed the disputants that No.",
    "17 was my cabin they could have Nos 13 and 28 respectively or stay where they were\u2014\nwhichever they chose.",
    "I permitted my eyes to tell him what a hero he was and then installed myself in my new\ndomain.",
    "The encounter had done me worlds of good.",
    "The sea was smooth the weather\ngrowing daily warmer.",
    "Seasickness was a thing of the past\nI went up on deck and was initiated into the mysteries of deck quoits.",
    "I entered my name\nfor various sports.",
    "Tea was served on deck and I ate heartily.",
    "After tea I played\nshovelboard with some pleasant young men.",
    "They were extraordinarily nice to me.",
    "I felt that\nlife was satisfactory and delightful.",
    "The dressing bugle came as a surprise and I hurried to my new cabin.",
    "The stewardess\nwas awaiting me with a troubled face.",
    "\u201cThere\u2019s a terrible smell in your cabin miss.",
    "What it is I\u2019m sure I can\u2019t think but I doubt\n\n\fif you\u2019ll be able to sleep here.",
    "There\u2019s a deck cabin up on C deck.",
    "You might move into that\n\u2014just for the night anyway.\u201d\nThe smell really was pretty bad\u2014quite nauseating.",
    "I told the stewardess I would think\nover the question of moving whilst I dressed.",
    "I hurried over my toilet sniffing distastefully\nas I did so.",
    "What was the smell Dead rat No worse than that\u2014and quite different.",
    "Yet I knew it It\nwas something I had smelt before.",
    "Something\u2014Ah I had got it.",
    "Asafoetida I had worked in\na hospital dispensary during the war for a short time and had become acquainted with\nvarious nauseous drugs.",
    "Asafoetida that was it.",
    "But how\u2014\nI sank down on the sofa suddenly realizing the thing.",
    "Somebody had put a pinch of\nasafoetida in my cabin.",
    "Why So that I should vacate it Why were they so anxious to get me\nout I thought of the scene this afternoon from a rather different point of view.",
    "What was it\nabout Cabin 17 that made so many people anxious to get hold of it The other two cabins\nwere better cabins why had both men insisted on sticking to 17\n17.",
    "How the number persisted It was on the 17th I had sailed from Southampton.",
    "It was a\n17\u2014I stopped with a sudden gasp.",
    "Quickly I unlocked my suitcase and took my precious\npaper from its place of concealment in some rolled stockings.",
    "17 1 22\u2014I had taken that for a date the date of departure of the Kilmorden Castle.",
    "Supposing I was wrong.",
    "When I came to think of it would anyone writing down a date\nthink it necessary to put the year as well as the month Supposing 17 meant Cabin 17 and\n1 The time\u2014one o\u2019clock.",
    "Then 22 must be the date.",
    "I looked up at my little almanac.",
    "Tomorrow was the 22nd\n\n\fTen\n\nI was violently excited.",
    "I was sure that I had hit on the right trail at last.",
    "One thing was\nclear I must not move out of the cabin.",
    "The asafoetida had got to be borne.",
    "I examined my\nfacts again.",
    "Tomorrow was the 22nd and at 1 am or 1 pm something would happen.",
    "I plumped for 1\nam.",
    "It was now seven o\u2019clock.",
    "In six hours I should know.",
    "I don\u2019t know how I got through the evening.",
    "I retired to my cabin fairly early.",
    "I had told\nthe stewardess that I had a cold in the head and didn\u2019t mind smells.",
    "She still seemed\ndistressed but I was firm.",
    "The evening seemed interminable.",
    "I duly retired to bed but in view of emergencies I\nswathed myself in a thick flannel dressing gown and encased my feet in slippers.",
    "Thus\nattired I felt that I could spring up and take an active part in anything that happened.",
    "What did I expect to happen I hardly knew.",
    "Vague fancies most of them wildly\nimprobable flitted through my brain.",
    "But one thing I was firmly convinced of at one\no\u2019clock something would happen.",
    "At various times I heard fellow passengers coming to bed.",
    "Fragments of conversation\nlaughing good nights floated in through the open transom.",
    "Then silence.",
    "Most of the lights\nwent out.",
    "There was still one in the passage outside and there was therefore a certain\namount of light in my cabin.",
    "I heard eight bells go.",
    "The hour that followed seemed the\nlongest I had ever known.",
    "I consulted my watch surreptitiously to be sure I had not overshot\nthe time.",
    "If my deductions were wrong if nothing happened at one o\u2019clock I should have made a\nfool of myself and spent all the money I had in the world on a mare\u2019s nest.",
    "My heart beat\npainfully.",
    "Two bells went overhead.",
    "One o\u2019clock And nothing.",
    "Wait\u2014what was that I heard the\nquick light patter of feet running\u2014running along the passage.",
    "Then with the suddenness of a bombshell my cabin door burst open and a man almost fell\ninside.",
    "\u201cSave me\u201d he said hoarsely.",
    "\u201cThey\u2019re after me.\u201d\nIt was not a moment for argument or explanation.",
    "I could hear footsteps outside.",
    "I had\nabout forty seconds in which to act.",
    "I had sprung to my feet and was standing facing the\nstranger in the middle of the cabin.",
    "A cabin does not abound in hiding places for a sixfoot man.",
    "With one arm I pulled out\nmy cabin trunk.",
    "He slipped down behind it under the bunk.",
    "I raised the lid.",
    "At the same time\nwith the other hand I pulled down the washbasin.",
    "A deft movement and my hair was\nscrewed into a tiny knot on the top of my head.",
    "From the point of view of appearance it was\ninartistic from another standpoint it was supremely artistic.",
    "A lady with her hair screwed\ninto an unbecoming knob and in the act of removing a piece of soap from her trunk with\nwhich apparently to wash her neck could hardly be suspected of harbouring a fugitive.",
    "There was a knock at the door and without waiting for me to say \u201cCome in\u201d it was\npushed open.",
    "I don\u2019t know what I expected to see.",
    "I think I had vague ideas of Mr. Pagett brandishing a\nrevolver.",
    "Or my missionary friend with a sandbag or some other lethal weapon.",
    "But I\ncertainly did not expect to see a night stewardess with an inquiring face and looking the\nessence of respectability.",
    "\u201cI beg your pardon miss I thought you called out.\u201d\n\u201cNo\u201d I said \u201cI didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry for interrupting you.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s all right\u201d I said.",
    "\u201cI couldn\u2019t sleep.",
    "I thought a wash would do me good.\u201d It\nsounded rather as though it were a thing I never had as a general rule.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m so sorry miss\u201d said the stewardess again.",
    "\u201cBut there\u2019s a gentleman about who\u2019s\nrather drunk and we are afraid he might get into one of the ladies\u2019 cabins and frighten them.\u201d\n\u201cHow dreadful\u201d I said looking alarmed.",
    "\u201cHe won\u2019t come in here will he\u201d\n\u201cOh I don\u2019t think so miss.",
    "Ring the bell if he does.",
    "Good night.\u201d\n\u201cGood night.\u201d\nI opened the door and peeped down the corridor.",
    "Except for the retreating form of the\nstewardess there was nobody in sight.",
    "Drunk So that was the explanation of it.",
    "My histrionic talents had been wasted.",
    "I pulled\nthe cabin trunk out a little farther and said \u201cCome out at once please\u201d in an acid voice.",
    "There was no answer.",
    "I peered under the bunk.",
    "My visitor lay immoveable.",
    "He seemed to\nbe asleep.",

    "Using all my strength I succeeded in dragging the man out into the middle of the cabin.",
    "The dead whiteness of his face showed that he had fainted.",
    "I found the cause of his fainting\neasily enough.",
    "He had been stabbed under the left shoulder blade\u2014a nasty deep wound.",
    "I\n\n\fgot his coat off and set to work to attend to it.",
    "At the sting of the cold water he stirred then sat up.",
    "\u201cKeep still please\u201d I said.",
    "He was the kind of young man who recovers his faculties very quickly.",
    "He pulled himself\nto his feet and stood there swaying a little.",
    "\u201cThank you I don\u2019t need anything done for me.\u201d\nHis manner was defiant almost aggressive.",
    "Not a word of thanks\u2014of even common\ngratitude\n\u201cThat is a nasty wound.",
    "You must let me dress it.\u201d\n\u201cYou will do nothing of the kind.\u201d\nHe flung the words in my face as though I had been begging a favour of him.",
    "My temper\nnever placid rose.",
    "\u201cI cannot congratulate you on your manners\u201d I said coldly.",
    "\u201cI can at least relieve you of my presence.\u201d He started for the door but reeled as he did\nso.",

    "\u201cYou don\u2019t want to go bleeding all over the\nship do you\u201d\nHe seemed to see the sense of that for he sat quietly whilst I bandaged up the wound as\nbest I could.",
    "\u201cThere\u201d I said bestowing a pat on my handiwork \u201cthat will have to do for the present.",
    "Are you bettertempered now and do you feel inclined to tell me what it\u2019s all about\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry that I can\u2019t satisfy your very natural curiosity.\u201d\n\u201cWhy not\u201d I said chagrined.",
    "He smiled nastily.",
    "\u201cIf you want a thing broadcast tell a woman.",
    "Otherwise keep your mouth shut.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t you think I could keep a secret\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think\u2014I know.\u201d\nHe rose to his feet.",
    "\u201cAt any rate\u201d I said spitefully \u201cI shall be able to do a little broadcasting about the events\nof this evening.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve no doubt you will too\u201d he said indifferently.",

    "Sit down here by me.",
    "You look as though you hadn\u2019t slept\nwell.\u201d\n\u201cWhy do you call me that\u201d I asked as I sat down obediently.",
    "\u201cDo you mind It suits you somehow.",
    "I\u2019ve called you that in my own mind from the\nbeginning.",
    "It\u2019s the gipsy element in you that makes you so different from anyone else.",
    "I\ndecided in my own mind that you and Colonel Race were the only two people on board who\nwouldn\u2019t bore me to death to talk to.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s funny\u201d I said.",
    "\u201cI thought the same about you\u2014only it\u2019s more understandable in\nyour case.",
    "You\u2019re\u2014you\u2019re such an exquisitely finished product.\u201d\n\u201cNot badly put\u201d said Mrs. Blair nodding her head.",
    "\u201cTell me about yourself gipsy girl.",
    "Why are you going to South Africa\u201d\nI told her something about Papa\u2019s life work.",
    "\u201cSo you\u2019re Charles Beddingfeld\u2019s daughter I thought you weren\u2019t a mere provincial\nmiss Are you going to Broken Hill to grub up more skulls\u201d\n\u201cI may\u201d I said cautiously.",
    "\u201cI\u2019ve got other plans as well.\u201d\n\u201cWhat a mysterious minx you are.",
    "But you do look tired this morning.",
    "Didn\u2019t you sleep\nwell I can\u2019t keep awake on board a boat.",
    "Ten hours\u201d sleep for a fool they say I could do\nwith twenty\u201d\nShe yawned looking like a sleepy kitten.",
    "\u201cAn idiot of a steward woke me up in the\nmiddle of the night to return me that roll of films I dropped yesterday.",
    "He did it in the most\nmelodramatic manner stuck his arm through the ventilator and dropped them neatly in the\nmiddle of my tummy.",
    "I thought it was a bomb for a moment\u201d\n\u201cHere\u2019s your Colonel\u201d I said as the tall soldierly figure of Colonel Race appeared on\nthe deck.",
    "\u201cHe\u2019s not my Colonel particularly.",
    "In fact he admires you very much gipsy girl.",
    "So don\u2019t\nrun away.\u201d\n\u201cI want to tie something round my head.",
    "It will be more comfortable than a hat.\u201d\nI slipped quickly away.",
    "For some reason or other I was uncomfortable with Colonel\n\n\fRace.",
    "He was one of the few people who were capable of making me feel shy.",
    "I went down to my cabin and began looking for something with which I could restrain my\nrebellious locks.",
    "Now I am a tidy person I like my things always arranged in a certain way\nand I keep them so.",
    "I had no sooner opened my drawer than I realized that somebody had\nbeen disarranging my things.",
    "Everything had been turned over and scattered.",
    "I looked in the\nother drawers and the small hanging cupboard.",
    "They told the same tale.",
    "It was as though\nsomeone had been making a hurried and ineffectual search for something.",
    "I sat down on the edge of the bunk with a grave face.",
    "Who had been searching my cabin\nand what had they been looking for Was it the half sheet of paper with scribbled figures\nand words I shook my head dissatisfied.",
    "Surely that was past history now.",
    "But what else\ncould there be\nI wanted to think.",
    "The events of last night though exciting had not really done anything to\nelucidate matters.",
    "Who was the young man who had burst into my cabin so abruptly I had\nnot seen him on board previously either on deck or in the saloon.",
    "Was he one of the ship\u2019s\ncompany or was he a passenger Who had stabbed him Why had they stabbed him And\nwhy in the name of goodness should Cabin No 17 figure so prominently It was all a\nmystery but there was no doubt that some very peculiar occurrences were taking place on\nthe Kilmorden Castle.",
    "I counted off on my fingers the people on whom it behoved me to keep watch.",
    "Setting aside my visitor of the night before but promising myself that I would discover\nhim on board before another day had passed I selected the following persons as worthy of\nmy notice\n1 Sir Eustace Pedler.",
    "He was the owner of the Mill House and his presence on the\nKilmorden Castle seemed something of a coincidence.",
    "2 Mr. Pagett the sinisterlooking secretary whose eagerness to obtain Cabin 17 had\nbeen so very marked.",
    "N.B.\u2014Find out whether he had accompanied Sir Eustace to Cannes.",
    "3 The Rev.",
    "Edward Chichester.",
    "All I had against him was his obstinacy over Cabin 17\nand that might be entirely due to his own peculiar temperament.",
    "Obstinacy can be an\namazing thing.",
    "But a little conversation with Mr. Chichester would not come amiss I decided.",
    "Hastily\ntying a handkerchief round my hair I went up on deck again full of purpose.",
    "I was in luck.",
    "My quarry was leaning against the rail drinking beef tea.",
    "I went up to him.",
    "\u201cI hope you\u2019ve forgiven me over Cabin 17\u201d I said with my best smile.",
    "\u201cI consider it unchristian to bear a grudge\u201d said Mr. Chichester coldly.",
    "\u201cBut the purser\nhad distinctly promised me that cabin.\u201d\n\u201cPursers are such busy men aren\u2019t they\u201d I said vaguely.",
    "\u201cI suppose they\u2019re bound to\n\n\fforget sometimes.\u201d\nMr. Chichester did not reply.",
    "\u201cIs this your first visit to South Africa\u201d I inquired conversationally.",
    "\u201cTo South Africa yes.",
    "But I have worked for the last two years amongst the cannibal\ntribes in the interior of East Africa.\u201d\n\u201cHow thrilling Have you had many narrow escapes\u201d\n\u201cEscapes\u201d\n\u201cOf being eaten I mean\u201d\n\u201cYou should not treat sacred subjects with levity Miss Beddingfeld.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know that cannibalism was a sacred subject\u201d I retorted stung.",
    "As the words left my lips another idea struck me.",
    "If Mr. Chichester had indeed spent the\nlast two years in the interior of Africa how was it that he was not more sunburnt His skin\nwas as pink and white as a baby\u2019s.",
    "Surely there was something fishy there Yet his manner\nand voice were so absolutely it.",
    "Too much so perhaps.",
    "Was he\u2014or was he not\u2014just a\nlittle like a stage clergyman\nI cast my mind back to the curates I had known at Little Hampsley.",
    "Some of them I had\nliked some of them I had not but certainly none of them had been quite like Mr. Chichester.",
    "They had been human\u2014he was a glorified type.",
    "I was debating all this when Sir Eustace Pedler passed down the deck.",
    "Just as he was\nabreast of Mr. Chichester he stooped and picked up a piece of paper which he handed to\nhim remarking \u201cYou\u2019ve dropped something.\u201d\nHe passed on without stopping and so probably did not notice Mr. Chichester\u2019s\nagitation.",
    "I did.",
    "Whatever it was he had dropped its recovery agitated him considerably.",
    "He\nturned a sickly green and crumpled up the sheet of paper into a ball.",
    "My suspicions were\naccentuated a hundredfold.",
    "He caught my eye and hurried into explanations.",
    "\u201cA\u2014a\u2014fragment of a sermon I was composing\u201d he said with a sickly smile.",
    "\u201cIndeed\u201d I rejoined politely.",
    "A fragment of a sermon indeed No Mr. Chichester\u2014too weak for words\nHe soon left me with a muttered excuse.",
    "I wished oh how I wished that I had been the\none to pick up that paper and not Sir Eustace Pedler One thing was clear Mr. Chichester\ncould not be exempted from my list of suspects.",
    "I was inclined to put him top of the three.",
    "After lunch when I came up to the lounge for coffee I noticed Sir Eustace and Pagett\n\n\fsitting with Mrs. Blair and Colonel Race.",
    "Mrs. Blair welcomed me with a smile so I went\nover and joined them.",
    "They were talking about Italy.",
    "\u201cBut it is misleading\u201d Mrs. Blair insisted.",
    "\u201cAqua calda certainly ought to be cold water\n\u2014not hot.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re not a Latin scholar\u201d said Sir Eustace smiling.",
    "\u201cMen are so superior about their Latin\u201d said Mrs. Blair.",
    "\u201cBut all the same I notice that\nwhen you ask them to translate inscriptions in old churches they can never do it They hem\nand haw and get out of it somehow.\u201d\n\u201cQuite right\u201d said Colonel Race.",
    "\u201cI always do.\u201d\n\u201cBut I love the Italians\u201d continued Mrs. Blair.",
    "\u201cThey\u2019re so obliging\u2014though even that\nhas its embarrassing side.",
    "You ask them the way somewhere and instead of saying \u2018first to\nthe right second to the left\u2019 or something that one could follow they pour out a flood of\nwellmeaning directions and when you look bewildered they take you kindly by the arm and\nwalk all the way there with you.\u201d\n\u201cIs that your experience in Florence Pagett\u201d asked Sir Eustace turning with a smile to\nhis secretary.",
    "For some reason the question seemed to disconcert Mr. Pagett.",
    "He stammered and\nflushed.",
    "\u201cOh quite so yes\u2014er quite so.\u201d\nThen with a murmured excuse he rose and left the table.",
    "\u201cI am beginning to suspect Guy Pagett of having committed some dark deed in Florence\u201d\nremarked Sir Eustace gazing after his secretary\u2019s retreating figure.",
    "\u201cWhenever Florence or\nItaly is mentioned he changes the subject or bolts precipitately.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps he murdered someone there\u201d said Mrs. Blair hopefully.",
    "\u201cHe looks\u2014I hope I\u2019m\nnot hurting your feelings Sir Eustace\u2014but he does look as though he might murder\nsomeone.\u201d\n\u201cYes pure Cinquecento It amuses me sometimes\u2014especially when one knows as well\nas I do how essentially lawabiding and respectable the poor fellow really is.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s been with you some time hasn\u2019t he Sir Eustace\u201d asked Colonel Race.",
    "\u201cSix years\u201d said Sir Eustace with a deep sigh.",
    "\u201cHe must be quite invaluable to you\u201d said Mrs. Blair.",
    "\u201cOh invaluable Yes quite invaluable.\u201d The poor man sounded even more depressed as\nthough the invaluableness of Mr. Pagett was a secret grief to him.",
    "Then he added more\nbriskly \u201cBut his face should really inspire you with confidence my dear lady.",
    "No self\n\n\frespecting murderer would ever consent to look like one.",
    "Crippen now I believe was one\nof the pleasantest fellows imaginable.\u201d\n\u201cHe was caught on a liner wasn\u2019t he\u201d murmured Mrs. Blair.",
    "There was a slight rattle behind us.",
    "I turned quickly.",
    "Mr. Chichester had dropped his\ncoffee cup.",
    "Our party soon broke up Mrs. Blair went below to sleep and I went out on deck.",
    "Colonel\nRace followed me.",
    "\u201cYou\u2019re very elusive Miss Beddingfeld.",
    "I looked for you everywhere last night at the\ndance.\u201d\n\u201cI went to bed early\u201d I explained.",
    "\u201cAre you going to run away tonight too Or are you going to dance with me\u201d\n\u201cI shall be very pleased to dance with you\u201d I murmured shyly.",
    "\u201cBut Mrs. Blair\u2014\u201d\n\u201cOur friend Mrs. Blair doesn\u2019t care for dancing.\u201d\n\u201cAnd do you\u201d\n\u201cI care for dancing with you.\u201d\n\u201cOh\u201d I said nervously.",
    "I was a little afraid of Colonel Race.",
    "Nevertheless I was enjoying myself.",
    "This was better\nthan discussing fossilized skulls with stuffy old professors Colonel Race was really just my\nideal of a stern silent Rhodesian.",
    "Possibly I might marry him I hadn\u2019t been asked it is true\nbut as the Boy Scouts say Be Prepared And all women without in the least meaning it\nconsider every man they meet as a possible husband for themselves or their best friend.",
    "I danced several times with him that evening.",
    "He danced well.",
    "When the dancing was\nover and I was thinking of going to bed he suggested a turn round the deck.",
    "We walked\nround three times and finally subsided into two deck chairs.",
    "There was nobody else in sight.",
    "We made desultory conversation for some time.",
    "\u201cDo you know Miss Beddingfeld I think I once met your father A very interesting man\n\u2014on his own subject and it\u2019s a subject that has a special fascination for me.",
    "In my humble\nway I\u2019ve done a bit in that line myself.",
    "Why when I was in the Dordogne region\u2014\u201d\nOur talk became technical.",
    "Colonel Race\u2019s boast was not an idle one.",
    "He knew a great\ndeal.",
    "At the same time he made one or two curious mistakes\u2014slips of the tongue I might\nalmost have thought them.",
    "But he was quick to take his cue from me and to cover them up.",
    "Once he spoke of the Mousterian period as succeeding the Aurignacian\u2014an absurd mistake\nfor one who knew anything of the subject.",
    "It was twelve o\u2019clock when I went to my cabin.",
    "I was still puzzling over those queer\n\n\fdiscrepancies.",
    "Was it possible that he had \u201cgot the whole subject up\u201d for the occasion\u2014that\nreally he knew nothing of archaeology I shook my head vaguely dissatisfied with that\nsolution.",
    "Just as I was dropping off to sleep I sat up with a sudden start as another idea flashed\ninto my head.",
    "Had he been pumping me Were those slight inaccuracies just tests\u2014to see\nwhether I really knew what I was talking about In other words he suspected me of not\nbeing genuinely Anne Beddingfeld.",
    "Why\n\n\fTwelve\nExtract from the diary of Sir Eustace Pedler\n\nThere is something to be said for life on board ship.",
    "It is peaceful.",
    "My grey hairs\nfortunately exempt me from the indignities of bobbing for apples running up and down\ndeck with potatoes and eggs and the more painful sports of \u201cBrother Bill\u201d and Bolster\nBar.",
    "What amusement people can find in these painful proceedings has always been a\nmystery to me.",
    "But there are many fools in the world.",
    "One praises God for their existence\nand keeps out of their way.",
    "Fortunately I am an excellent sailor.",
    "Pagett poor fellow is not.",
    "He began turning\ngreen as soon as we were out of the Solent.",
    "I presume my other socalled secretary is\nalso seasick.",
    "At any rate he has not yet made an appearance.",
    "But perhaps it is not\nseasickness but high diplomacy.",
    "The great thing is that I have not been worried by him.",
    "On the whole the people onboard are a mangy lot.",
    "Only two decent Bridge players and\none decentlooking woman\u2014Mrs.",
    "Clarence Blair.",
    "I\u2019ve met her in town of course.",
    "She is\none of the only women I know who can lay claim to a sense of humour.",
    "I enjoy talking to\nher and should enjoy it more if it were not for a longlegged taciturn ass who attached\nhimself to her like a limpet.",
    "I cannot think that this Colonel Race really amuses her.",
    "He\u2019s\ngoodlooking in his way but dull as ditch water.",
    "One of these strong silent men that lady\nnovelists and young girls always rave over.",
    "Guy Pagett struggled up on deck after we left Madeira and began babbling in a hollow\nvoice about work.",
    "What the devil does anyone want to work for onboard ship It is true\nthat I promised my publishers my \u201cReminiscences\u201d early in the summer but what of it\nWho really reads reminiscences Old ladies in the suburbs.",
    "And what do my\nreminiscences amount to I\u2019ve knocked against a certain number of socalled famous\npeople in my lifetime.",
    "With the assistance of Pagett I invented insipid anecdotes about\nthem.",
    "And the truth of the matter is Pagett is too honest for the job.",
    "He won\u2019t let me\ninvent anecdotes about the people I might have met but haven\u2019t.",
    "I tried kindness with him.",
    "\u201cYou look a perfect wreck still my dear chap\u201d I said easily.",
    "\u201cWhat you need is a deck\nchair in the sun.",
    "No\u2014not another word.",
    "The work must wait.\u201d\nThe next thing I knew he was worrying about an extra cabin.",
    "\u201cThere\u2019s no room to work\nin your cabin Sir Eustace.",
    "It\u2019s full of trunks.\u201d\nFrom his tone you might have thought the trunks were black beetles something that\nhad no business to be there.",
    "I explained to him that though he might not be aware of the fact it was usual to take a\nchange of clothing with one when travelling.",
    "He gave the wan smile with which he always\ngreets my attempts at humour and then reverted to the business in hand.",
    "\u201cAnd we could hardly work in my little hole.\u201d\nI know Pagett\u2019s \u201clittle holes\u201d\u2014he usually has the best cabin on the ship.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m sorry the Captain didn\u2019t turn out for you this time\u201d I said sarcastically.",
    "\u201cPerhaps you\u2019d like to dump some of your extra luggage in my cabin\u201d\nSarcasm is dangerous with a man like Pagett.",
    "He brightened up at once.",
    "\u201cWell if I could get rid of the typewriter and the stationery trunk\u2014\u201d\nThe stationery trunk weighs several solid tons.",
    "It causes endless unpleasantness with\nthe porters and it is the aim of Pagett\u2019s life to foist it on me.",
    "It is a perpetual struggle\nbetween us.",
    "He seems to regard it as my special personal property.",
    "I on the other hand\nregard the charge of it as the only thing where a secretary is really useful.",
    "\u201cWe\u2019ll get an extra cabin\u201d I said hastily.",
    "The thing seemed simple enough but Pagett is a person who loves to make mysteries.",
    "He came to me the next day with a face like a Renaissance conspirator.",
    "\u201cYou know you told me to get Cabin 17 for an office\u201d\n\u201cWell what of it Has the stationery trunk jammed in the doorway\u201d\n\u201cThe doorways are the same size in all the cabins\u201d replied Pagett seriously.",
    "\u201cBut I\ntell you Sir Eustace there\u2019s something very queer about that cabin.\u201d\nMemories of reading The Upper Berth floated through my mind.",
    "\u201cIf you mean that it\u2019s haunted\u201d I said \u201cwe\u2019re not going to sleep there so I don\u2019t see\nthat it matters.",
    "Ghosts don\u2019t affect typewriters.\u201d\nPagett said that it wasn\u2019t a ghost and that after all he hadn\u2019t got Cabin 17.",
    "He told\nme a long garbled story.",
    "Apparently he and a Mr. Chichester and a girl called\nBeddingfeld had almost come to blows over the cabin.",
    "Needless to say the girl had won\nand Pagett was apparently feeling sore over the matter.",
    "\u201cBoth 13 and 28 are better cabins\u201d he reiterated.",
    "\u201cBut they wouldn\u2019t look at them.\u201d\n\u201cWell\u201d I said stifling a yawn \u201cfor that matter no more would you my dear Pagett.\u201d\nHe gave me a reproachful look.",
    "\u201cYou told me to get Cabin 17.\u201d\nThere is a touch of the \u201cboy upon the burning deck\u201d about Pagett.",
    "\u201cMy dear fellow\u201d I said testily \u201cI mentioned No.",
    "17 because I happened to observe\n\n\fthat it was vacant.",
    "But I didn\u2019t mean you to make a stand to the death about it\u201413 or 28\nwould have done us equally well.\u201d\nHe looked hurt.",
    "\u201cThere\u2019s something more though\u201d he insisted.",
    "\u201cMiss Beddingfeld got the cabin but\nthis morning I saw Chichester coming out of it in a furtive sort of way.\u201d\nI looked at him severely.",
    "\u201cIf you\u2019re trying to get up a nasty scandal about Chichester who is a missionary\u2014\nthough a perfectly poisonous person\u2014and that attractive child Anne Beddingfeld I\ndon\u2019t believe a word of it\u201d I said coldly.",
    "\u201cAnne Beddingfeld is an extremely nice girl\u2014\nwith particularly good legs.",
    "I should say she had far and away the best legs on board.\u201d\nPagett did not like my reference to Anne Beddingfeld\u2019s legs.",
    "He is the sort of man who\nnever notices legs himself\u2014or if he does would die sooner than say so.",
    "Also he thinks\nmy appreciation of such things frivolous.",
    "I like annoying Pagett so I continued\nmaliciously\n\u201cAs you\u2019ve made her acquaintance you might ask her to dine at our table tomorrow\nnight.",
    "It\u2019s the Fancy Dress dance.",
    "By the way you\u2019d better go down to the barber and\nselect a fancy costume for me.\u201d\n\u201cSurely you will not go in fancy dress\u201d said Pagett in tones of horror.",
    "I could see that it was quite incompatible with his idea of my dignity.",
    "He looked\nshocked and pained.",
    "I had really had no intention of donning fancy dress but the\ncomplete discomfiture of Pagett was too tempting to be forborne.",
    "\u201cWhat do you mean\u201d I said.",
    "\u201cOf course I shall wear fancy dress.",
    "So will you.\u201d\nPagett shuddered.",
    "\u201cSo go down to the barber\u2019s and see about it\u201d I finished.",
    "\u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019ll have any\nout sizes\u201d murmured Pagett measuring my figure with his eye.",
    "Without meaning it Pagett can occasionally be extremely offensive.",
    "\u201cAnd order a table for six in the saloon\u201d I said.",
    "\u201cWe\u2019ll have the Captain the girl with\nthe nice legs Mrs. Blair\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou won\u2019t get Mrs. Blair without Colonel Race\u201d Pagett interposed.",
    "\u201cHe\u2019s asked her\nto dine with him I know.\u201d\nPagett always knows everything.",
    "I was justifiably annoyed.",
    "\u201cWho is Race\u201d I demanded exasperated.",
    "As I said before Pagett always knows everything\u2014or thinks he does.",
    "He looked\nmysterious again.",
    "\u201cThey say he\u2019s a Secret Service chap Sir Eustace.",
    "Rather a great gun too.",
    "But of\ncourse I don\u2019t know for certain.\u201d\n\u201cIsn\u2019t that like the Government\u201d I exclaimed.",
    "\u201cHere\u2019s a man onboard whose business\nit is to carry about secret documents and they go giving them to a peaceful outsider who\nonly asks to be let alone.\u201d\nPagett looked even more mysterious.",
    "He came a pace nearer and dropped his voice.",
    "\u201cIf you ask me the whole thing is very queer Sir Eustace.",
    "Look at the illness of mine\nbefore we started\u2014\u201d\n\u201cMy dear fellow\u201d I interrupted brutally \u201cthat was a bilious attack.",
    "You\u2019re always\nhaving bilious attacks.\u201d\nPagett winced slightly.",
    "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t the usual sort of bilious attack.",
    "This time\u2014\u201d\n\u201cFor God\u2019s sake don\u2019t go into details of your condition Pagett.",
    "I don\u2019t want to hear\nthem.\u201d\n\u201cVery well Sir Eustace.",
    "But my belief is that I was deliberately poisoned\u201d\n\u201cAh\u201d I said.",

    "\u201cAt any rate Sir Eustace he thinks so\u2014and he should be in a position to know.\u201d\n\u201cBy the way where is the chap\u201d I asked.",
    "\u201cI\u2019ve not set eyes on him since we came\nonboard.\u201d\n\u201cHe gives out that he\u2019s ill and stays in his cabin Sir Eustace.\u201d Pagett\u2019s voice\ndropped again.",
    "\u201cBut that\u2019s camouflage I\u2019m sure.",
    "So that he can watch better.\u201d\n\u201cWatch\u201d\n\u201cOver your safety Sir Eustace.",
    "In case an attack should be made upon you.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re such a cheerful fellow Pagett\u201d I said.",
    "\u201cI trust that your imagination runs\naway with you.",
    "If I were you I should go to the dance as a death\u2019s head or an\nexecutioner.",
    "It will suit your mournful style of beauty.\u201d\nThat shut him up for the time being.",
    "I went on deck.",
    "The Beddingfeld girl was deep in\nconversation with the missionary parson Chichester.",
    "Women always flutter round\nparsons.",
    "A man of my figure hates stooping but I had the courtesy to pick up a bit of paper that\nwas fluttering round the parson\u2019s feet.",
    "I got no word of thanks for my pains.",
    "As a matter of fact I couldn\u2019t help seeing what\n\n\fwas written on the sheet of paper.",
    "There was just one sentence.",
    "\u201cDon\u2019t try to play a lone hand or it will be the worse for you.\u201d\nThat\u2019s a nice thing for a parson to have.",
    "Who is this fellow Chichester I wonder He\nlooks mild as milk.",
    "But looks are deceptive.",
    "I shall ask Pagett about him.",
    "Pagett always\nknows everything.",
    "I sank gracefully into my deck chair by the side of Mrs. Blair thereby interrupting her\nt\u00eate\u00e0t\u00eate with Race and remarked that I didn\u2019t know what the clergy were coming to\nnowadays.",
    "Then I asked her to dine with me on the night of the Fancy Dress dance.",
    "Somehow or\nother Race managed to get included in the invitation.",
    "After lunch the Beddingfeld girl came and sat with us for coffee.",
    "I was right about her\nlegs.",
    "They are the best on the ship.",
    "I shall certainly ask her to dinner as well.",
    "I would very much like to know what mischief Pagett was up to in Florence.",
    "Whenever\nItaly is mentioned he goes to pieces.",
    "If I did not know how intensely respectable he is\u2014I\nshould suspect him of some disreputable amour. . . .",
    "I wonder now Even the most respectable men\u2014It would cheer me up enormously if it\nwas so.",
    "Pagett\u2014with a guilty secret Splendid\n\n\fThirteen\n\nIt has been a curious evening.",
    "The only costume that fitted me in the barber\u2019s emporium was that of a Teddy Bear.",
    "I\ndon\u2019t mind playing bears with some nice young girls on a winter\u2019s evening in England\u2014\nbut it\u2019s hardly an ideal costume for the equator.",
    "However I created a good deal of\nmerriment and won first prize for \u201cbrought onboard\u201d\u2014an absurd term for a costume\nhired for the evening.",
    "Still as nobody seemed to have the least idea whether they were\nmade or brought it didn\u2019t matter.",
    "Mrs. Blair refused to dress up.",
    "Apparently she is at one with Pagett on the matter.",
    "Colonel Race followed her example.",
    "Anne Beddingfeld had concocted a gipsy costume for\nherself and looked extraordinarily well.",
    "Pagett said he had a headache and didn\u2019t\nappear.",
    "To replace him I asked a quaint little fellow called Reeves.",
    "He\u2019s a prominent\nmember of the South African labour party.",
    "Horrible little man but I want to keep in with\nhim as he gives me information that I need.",
    "I want to understand this Rand business from\nboth sides.",
    "Dancing was a hot affair.",
    "I danced twice with Anne Beddingfeld and she had to\npretend she liked it.",
    "I danced once with Mrs. Blair who didn\u2019t trouble to pretend and I\nvictimized various other damsels whose appearance struck me favourably.",
    "Then we went down to supper.",
    "I had ordered champagne the steward suggested\nClicquot 1911 as being the best they had on the boat and I fell in with his suggestion.",
    "I\nseemed to have hit on the one thing that would loosen Colonel Race\u2019s tongue.",
    "Far from\nbeing taciturn the man became actually talkative.",
    "For a while this amused me then it\noccurred to me that Colonel Race and not myself was becoming the life and soul of the\nparty.",
    "He chaffed me at length about keeping a diary.",
    "\u201cIt will reveal all your indiscretions one of these days Pedler.\u201d\n\u201cMy dear Race\u201d I said \u201cI venture to suggest that I am not quite the fool you think me.",
    "I may commit indiscretions but I don\u2019t write them down in black and white.",
    "After my\ndeath my executors will know my opinion of a great many people but I doubt if they will\nfind anything to add or detract from their opinion of me.",
    "A diary is useful for recording\nthe idiosyncrasies of other people\u2014but not one\u2019s own.\u201d\n\u201cThere is such a thing as unconscious selfrevelation though.\u201d\n\u201cIn the eyes of the psychoanalyst all things are vile\u201d I replied sententiously.",
    "\u201cYou must have had a very interesting life Colonel Race\u201d said Miss Beddingfeld\n\n\fgazing at him with wide starry eyes.",
    "That\u2019s how they do it these girls Othello charmed Desdemona by telling her stories\nbut oh didn\u2019t Desdemona charm Othello by the way she listened\nAnyway the girl set Race off all right.",
    "He began to tell lion stories.",
    "A man who has\nshot lions in large quantities has an unfair advantage over other men.",
    "It seemed to me\nthat it was time I too told a lion story.",
    "One of a more sprightly character.",
    "\u201cBy the way\u201d I remarked \u201cthat reminds me of a rather exciting tale I heard.",
    "A friend\nof mine was out on a shooting trip somewhere in East Africa.",
    "One night he came out of\nhis tent for some reason and was startled by a low growl.",
    "He turned sharply and saw a\nlion crouching to spring.",
    "He had left his rifle in the tent.",
    "Quick as thought he ducked\nand the lion sprang right over his head.",
    "Annoyed at having missed him the animal\ngrowled and prepared to spring again.",
    "Again he ducked and again the lion sprang right\nover him.",
    "This happened a third time but by now he was close to the entrance of his tent\nand he darted in and seized his rifle.",
    "When he emerged rifle in hand the lion had\ndisappeared.",
    "That puzzled him greatly.",
    "He crept round the back of the tent where there\nwas a little clearing.",
    "There sure enough was the lion busily practising low jumps.\u201d\nThis was received by a roar of applause.",
    "I drank some champagne.",
    "\u201cOn another occasion\u201d I remarked \u201cthis friend of mine had a second curious\nexperience.",
    "He was trekking across country and being anxious to arrive at his\ndestination before the heat of the day he ordered his boys to inspan whilst it was still\ndark.",
    "They had some trouble in doing so as the mules were very restive but at last they\nmanaged it and a start was made.",
    "The mules raced along like the wind and when\ndaylight came they saw why.",
    "In the darkness the boys had inspanned a lion as the near\nwheeler.\u201d\nThis too was wellreceived a ripple of merriment going round the table but I am not\nsure that the greatest tribute did not come from my friend the Labour Member who\nremained pale and serious.",
    "\u201cMy God\u201d he said anxiously.",
    "\u201cWho un\u2019arnessed them\u201d\n\u201cI must go to Rhodesia\u201d said Mrs. Blair.",
    "\u201cAfter what you have told us Colonel Race\nI simply must.",
    "It\u2019s a horrible journey though five days in the train.\u201d\n\u201cYou must join me in my private car\u201d I said gallantly.",
    "\u201cOh Sir Eustace how sweet of you Do you really mean it\u201d\n\u201cDo I mean it\u201d I exclaimed reproachfully and drank another glass of champagne.",
    "\u201cJust about another week and we shall be in South Africa\u201d sighed Mrs. Blair.",
    "\u201cAh South Africa\u201d I said sentimentally and began to quote from a recent speech of\n\n\fmine at the Colonial Institute.",
    "\u201cWhat has South Africa to show the world What indeed\nHer fruit and her farms her wool and her wattles her herds and her hides her gold\nmines and her diamonds\u2014\u201d\nI was hurrying on because I knew that as soon as I paused Reeves would butt in and\ninform me that the hides were worthless because the animals hung themselves up on\nbarbed wire or something of that sort would crab everything else and end up with the\nhardships of the miners on the Rand.",
    "And I was not in the mood to be abused as a\nCapitalist.",
    "However the interruption came from another source at the magic word\ndiamonds.",
    "\u201cDiamonds\u201d said Mrs. Blair ecstatically.",
    "\u201cDiamonds\u201d breathed Miss Beddingfeld.",

    "Race was being\ninundated with questions.",
    "What were mines like Was it true that the natives were kept\nshut up in compounds And so on.",
    "Race answered their questions and showed a good knowledge of his subject.",
    "He\ndescribed the methods of housing the natives the searches instituted and the various\nprecautions that De Beers took.",
    "\u201cThen it\u2019s practically impossible to steal any diamonds\u201d asked Mrs. Blair with as\nkeen an air of disappointment as though she had been journeying there for the express\npurpose.",
    "\u201cNothing\u2019s impossible Mrs. Blair.",
    "Thefts do occur\u2014like the case I told you of where\nthe Kafir hid the stone in his wound.\u201d\n\u201cYes but on a large scale\u201d\n\u201cOnce in recent years.",
    "Just before the War in fact.",
    "You must remember the case\nPedler.",
    "You were in South Africa at the time\u201d\nI nodded.",
    "\u201cTell us\u201d cried Miss Beddingfeld.",
    "\u201cOh do tell us\u201d\nRace smiled.",
    "\u201cVery well you shall have the story.",
    "I suppose most of you have heard of Sir Laurence\nEardsley the great South African mining magnate His mines were gold mines but he\ncomes into the story through his son.",
    "You may remember that just before the War\nrumours were afield of a new potential Kimberley hidden somewhere in the rocky floor of\nthe British Guiana jungles.",
    "Two young explorers so it was reported had returned from\n\n\fthat part of South America bringing with them a remarkable collection of rough\ndiamonds some of them of considerable size.",
    "Diamonds of small size had been found\nbefore in the neighbourhood of the Essequibo and Mazaruni rivers but these two young\nmen John Eardsley and his friend Lucas claimed to have discovered beds of great\ncarbon deposits at the common head of two streams.",
    "The diamonds were of every colour\npink blue yellow green black and the purest white.",
    "Eardsley and Lucas came to\nKimberley where they were to submit their gems to inspection.",
    "At the same time a\nsensational robbery was found to have taken place at De Beers.",
    "When sending diamonds\nto England they are made up into a packet.",
    "This remains in the big safe of which the two\nkeys are held by two different men whilst a third man knows the combination.",
    "They are\nhanded to the Bank and the Bank send them to England.",
    "Each package is worth roughly\nabout \u00a3100000.",
    "\u201cOn this occasion the Bank were struck by something a little unusual about the sealing\nof the packet.",
    "It was opened and found to contain knobs of sugar\n\u201cExactly how suspicion came to fasten on John Eardsley I do not know.",
    "It was\nremembered that he had been very wild at Cambridge and that his father had paid his\ndebts more than once.",
    "Anyhow it soon got about that this story of South American\ndiamond fields was all a fantasy.",
    "John Eardsley was arrested.",
    "In his possession was\nfound a portion of the De Beers diamonds.",
    "\u201cBut the case never came to court.",
    "Sir Laurence Eardsley paid over a sum equal to the\nmissing diamonds and De Beers did not prosecute.",
    "Exactly how the robbery was\ncommitted has never been known.",
    "But the knowledge that his son was a thief broke the\nold man\u2019s heart.",
    "He had a stroke shortly afterwards.",
    "As for John his Fate was in a way\nmerciful.",
    "He enlisted went to the War fought there bravely and was killed thus wiping\nout the stain on his name.",
    "Sir Laurence himself had a third stroke and died about a\nmonth ago.",
    "He died intestate and his vast fortune passed to his next of kin a man whom\nhe hardly knew.\u201d\nThe Colonel paused.",
    "A babel of ejaculations and questions broke out.",
    "Something\nseemed to attract Miss Beddingfeld\u2019s attention and she turned in her chair.",
    "At the little\ngasp she gave I too turned.",
    "My new secretary Rayburn was standing in the doorway.",
    "Under his tan his face had\nthe pallor of one who has seen a ghost.",
    "Evidently Race\u2019s story had moved him\nprofoundly.",
    "Suddenly conscious of our scrutiny he turned abruptly and disappeared.",
    "\u201cDo you know who that is\u201d asked Anne Beddingfeld abruptly.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s my other secretary\u201d I explained.",
    "\u201cMr.",
    "Rayburn.",
    "He\u2019s been seedy up to now.\u201d\nShe toyed with the bread by her plate.",
    "\u201cHas he been your secretary long\u201d\n\u201cNot very long\u201d I said cautiously.",
    "But caution is useless with a woman the more you hold back the more she presses\nforward.",
    "Anne Beddingfeld made no bones about it.",
    "\u201cHow long\u201d she asked bluntly.",
    "\u201cWell\u2014er\u2014I engaged him just before I sailed.",
    "Old friend of mine recommended him.\u201d\nShe said nothing more but relapsed into a thoughtful silence.",
    "I turned to Race with the\nfeeling that it was my turn to display an interest in his story.",
    "\u201cWho is Sir Laurence\u2019s next of kin Race Do you know\u201d\n\u201cI should do so\u201d he replied with a smile.",
    "\u201cI am\u201d\n\n\fFourteen\nAnne\u2019s Narrative Resumed\n\nIt was on the night of the Fancy Dress dance that I decided that the time had come for me to\nconfide in someone.",
    "So far I had played a lone hand and rather enjoyed it.",
    "Now suddenly\neverything was changed.",
    "I distrusted my own judgement and for the first time a feeling of\nloneliness and desolation crept over me.",
    "I sat on the edge of my bunk still in my gipsy dress and considered the situation.",
    "I\nthought first of Colonel Race.",
    "He had seemed to like me.",
    "He would be kind I was sure.",
    "And\nhe was no fool.",
    "Yet as I thought it over I wavered.",
    "He was a man of commanding\npersonality.",
    "He would take the whole matter out of my hands.",
    "And it was my mystery There\nwere other reasons too which I would hardly acknowledge to myself but which made it\ninadvisable to confide in Colonel Race.",
    "Then I thought of Mrs. Blair.",
    "She too had been kind to me.",
    "I did not delude myself into\nthe belief that that really meant anything.",
    "It was probably a mere whim of the moment.",
    "All\nthe same I had it in my power to interest her.",
    "She was a woman who had experienced most\nof the ordinary sensations in life.",
    "I proposed to supply her with an extraordinary one And I\nliked her liked her ease of manner her lack of sentimentality her freedom from any form of\naffectation.",
    "My mind was made up.",
    "I decided to seek her out then and there.",
    "She would hardly be in\nbed yet.",
    "Then I remembered that I did not know the number of her cabin.",
    "My friend the night\nstewardess would probably know.",
    "I rang the bell.",
    "After some delay it was answered by a man.",
    "He gave me the information I\nwanted.",
    "Mrs. Blair\u2019s cabin was No.",
    "71.",

    "There\u2019s no stewardess on duty after ten.\u201d\nHe withdrew and I was left to digest this morsel of information.",
    "Who was the woman\n\n\fwho had come to my cabin on the night of the 22nd My face grew graver as I realized the\ncunning and audacity of my unknown antagonists.",
    "Then pulling myself together I left my\nown cabin and sought that of Mrs. Blair.",

    "\u201cIts me\u2014Anne Beddingfeld.\u201d\n\u201cOh come in gipsy girl.\u201d\nI entered.",
    "A good deal of scattered clothing lay about and Mrs. Blair herself was draped\nin one of the loveliest kimonos I had ever seen.",

    "\u201cAnd I should love to hear the story of your life.",
    "You\u2019re a most\nunusual creature gipsy girl.",
    "Nobody else would think of bursting in on me at 1 am to tell me\nthe story of their life.",
    "Especially after snubbing my natural curiosity for weeks as you have\ndone I\u2019m not accustomed to being snubbed.",
    "It\u2019s been quite a pleasing novelty.",
    "Sit down on\nthe sofa and unburden your soul.\u201d\nI told her the whole story.",
    "It took some time as I was conscientious over all the details.",
    "She gave a deep sigh when I had finished but she did not say at all what I had expected her\nto say.",

    "But what does it all mean What was really meant to happen at\none o\u2019clock in Cabin 17 It can\u2019t be the stabbing of the secretary.",

    "\u201cThere\u2019s a dot after the 17.",
    "Why isn\u2019t there a dot after the 1 too\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s a space\u201d I pointed out.",
    "\u201cYes there\u2019s a space but\u2014\u201d\nSuddenly she rose and peered at the paper holding it as close under the light as possible.",

    "\u201cAnne that isn\u2019t a dot That\u2019s a flaw in the paper A flaw in the paper you see So\nyou\u2019ve got to ignore it and just go by the spaces\u2014the spaces\u201d\nI had risen and was standing by her.",

    "She\u2019s a celebrated Russian\ndancer you know.",
    "She\u2019s never appeared in London but Paris has been quite mad about her.",
    "She had a terrific success there all through the War.",
    "A thoroughly bad lot I believe but\nmost attractive.",

    "I rather fancy Colonel Race was over there simply on that account.",
    "He\u2019s told me some very interesting things.",
    "There was a regular organized gang not German\nin origin at all.",
    "In fact the head of it a man always referred to as \u2018the Colonel\u2019 was thought\nto be an Englishman but they never got any clue to his identity.",
    "But there is no doubt that he\ncontrolled a considerable organization of international crooks.",
    "Robberies espionage\nassaults he undertook them all\u2014and usually provided an innocent scapegoat to pay the\npenalty.",
    "Diabolically clever he must have been This woman was supposed to be one of his\nagents but they couldn\u2019t get hold of anything to go upon.",
    "Yes Anne we\u2019re on the right tack.",
    "Nadina is just the woman to be mixed up in this business.",
    "The appointment on the morning\nof the 22nd was with her in this cabin.",

    "No here it is.",

    "You know he\u2019d be a splendid match for you.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t have a good go at him with you aboard the ship\u201d I said laughing.",

    "She and Carton were to have met there they both had an\norder to view the same house and if they took such elaborate precautions to make their\nmeeting appear accidental they must have suspected they were being followed.",
    "All the\nsame Carton did not know that his shadower was the \u2018Man in the Brown Suit.\u2019 When he\nrecognized him the shock was so great that he lost his head completely and stepped back\nonto the line.",

    "But I must\nbe mistaken\u2014since you were in Florence at the time.",
    "And yet\u2014\u201d\nI studied him frankly.",

    "It was after midnight.",
    "I leaned over the rail watching the phosphorescent trail of foam.",

    "The man was handicapped by having to\nkeep me from crying out.",
    "If he had succeeded in reaching me unawares it would have been\neasy enough for him to sling me overboard with a sudden heave.",
    "The sharks would have\ntaken care of the rest.",
    "Struggle as I would I felt myself weakening.",
    "My assailant felt it too.",
    "He put out all his\nstrength.",
    "And then running on swift noiseless feet another shadow joined in.",
    "With one blow\nof his fist he sent my opponent crashing headlong to the deck.",
    "Released I fell back against\nthe rail sick and trembling.",
    "My rescuer turned to me with a quick movement.",
    "\u201cYou\u2019re hurt\u201d\nThere was something savage in his tone\u2014a menace against the person who had dared to\nhurt me.",
    "Even before he spoke I had recognized him.",
    "It was my man\u2014the man with the scar.",
    "But that one moment in which his attention had been diverted to me had been enough for\nthe fallen enemy.",
    "Quick as a flash he had risen to his feet and taken to his heels down the\ndeck.",
    "With an oath Rayburn sprang after him.",
    "I always hate being out of things.",
    "I joined the chase\u2014a bad third.",
    "Round the deck we\nwent to the starboard side of the ship.",
    "There by the saloon door lay the man in a crumpled\nheap.",

    "\u201cDid you hit him again\u201d I called breathlessly.",
    "\u201cThere was no need\u201d he replied grimly.",
    "\u201cI found him collapsed by the door.",
    "Or else he\ncouldn\u2019t get it open and is shamming.",
    "We\u2019ll soon see about that.",
    "And we\u2019ll see who he is\n\n\ftoo.\u201d\nWith a beating heart I drew nearer.",
    "I had realized at once that my assailant was a bigger\nman than Chichester.",
    "Anyway Chichester was a flabby creature who might use a knife at a\npinch but who would have little strength in his bare hands.",
    "Rayburn struck a match.",
    "We both uttered an ejaculation.",
    "The man was Guy Pagett.",
    "Rayburn appeared absolutely stupefied by the discovery.",
    "\u201cPagett\u201d he muttered.",
    "\u201cMy God Pagett.\u201d\nI felt a slight sense of superiority.",
    "\u201cYou seem surprised.\u201d\n\u201cI am\u201d he said heavily.",
    "\u201cI never suspected\u2014\u201d He wheeled suddenly round on me.",
    "\u201cAnd\nyou You\u2019re not You recognized him I suppose when he attacked you\u201d\n\u201cNo I didn\u2019t.",
    "All the same I\u2019m not so very surprised.\u201d\nHe stared at me suspiciously.",
    "\u201cWhere do you come in I wonder And how much do you know\u201d\nI smiled.",
    "\u201cA good deal Mr\u2014er\u2014Lucas\u201d\nHe caught my arm the unconscious strength of his grip made me wince.",
    "\u201cWhere did you get that name\u201d he asked hoarsely.",
    "\u201cIsn\u2019t it yours\u201d I demanded sweetly.",
    "\u201cOr do you prefer to be called \u2018The Man in the\nBrown Suit\u2019 \u201d\nThat did stagger him.",
    "He released my arm and fell back a pace or two.",
    "\u201cAre you a girl or a witch\u201d he breathed.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m a friend\u201d I advanced a step towards him.",
    "\u201cI offered you my help once\u2014I offer it\nagain.",
    "Will you have it\u201d\nThe fierceness of his answer took me aback.",
    "\u201cNo.",
    "I\u2019ll have no truck with you or with any woman.",
    "Do your damnedest.\u201d\nAs before my own temper began to rise.",
    "\u201cPerhaps\u201d I said \u201cyou don\u2019t realize how much in my power you are A word from me to\nthe Captain\u2014\u201d\n\u201cSay it\u201d he sneered.",
    "Then advancing with a quick step \u201cAnd whilst we\u2019re realizing\nthings my dear girl do you realize you\u2019re in my power this minute I could take you by the\n\n\fthroat like this.\u201d With a swift gesture he suited the action to the word.",
    "I felt his two hands\nclasp my throat and press\u2014ever so little.",
    "\u201cLike this\u2014and squeeze the life out of you And\nthen\u2014like our unconscious friend here but with more success\u2014fling your dead body to the\nsharks.",
    "What do you say to that\u201d\nI said nothing.",
    "I laughed.",
    "And yet I knew that the danger was real.",
    "Just at that moment he\nhated me.",
    "But I knew that I loved the danger loved the feeling of his hands on my throat.",
    "That I would not have exchanged that moment for any moment in my life.",
    "With a short laugh he released me.",
    "\u201cWhat\u2019s your name\u201d he asked abruptly.",
    "\u201cAnne Beddingfeld.\u201d\n\u201cDoes nothing frighten you Anne Beddingfeld\u201d\n\u201cOh yes\u201d I said with an assumption of coolness I was far from feeling.",
    "\u201cWasps\nsarcastic women very young men cockroaches and superior shop assistants.\u201d\nHe gave the same short laugh as before.",
    "Then he stirred the unconscious form of Pagett\nwith his feet.",
    "\u201cWhat shall we do with this junk Throw it overboard\u201d he asked carelessly.",
    "\u201cIf you like\u201d I answered with equal calm.",
    "\u201cI admire your wholehearted bloodthirsty instincts Miss Beddingfeld.",
    "But we will leave\nhim to recover at his leisure.",
    "He is not seriously hurt.\u201d\n\u201cYou shrink from a second murder I see\u201d I said sweetly.",
    "\u201cA second murder\u201d\nHe looked genuinely puzzled.",
    "\u201cThe woman at Marlow\u201d I reminded him watching the effect of my words closely.",
    "An ugly brooding expression settled down on his face.",
    "He seemed to have forgotten my\npresence.",
    "\u201cI might have killed her\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cSometimes I believe that I meant to kill her\u201d\nA wild rush of feeling hatred of the dead woman surged through me.",
    "I could have killed\nher that moment had she stood before me .",
    ". . For he must have loved her once\u2014he must\u2014\nhe must\u2014to have felt like that\nI regained control of myself and spoke in my normal voice\n\u201cWe seem to have said all there is to be said\u2014except good night.\u201d\n\u201cGood night and goodbye Miss Beddingfeld.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cAu revoir Mr. Lucas.\u201d\nAgain he flinched at the name.",
    "He came nearer.",
    "\u201cWhy do you say that\u2014au revoir I mean\u201d\n\u201cBecause I have a fancy that we shall meet again.\u201d\n\u201cNot if I can help it\u201d\nEmphatic as his tone was it did not offend me.",
    "On the contrary I hugged myself with\nsecret satisfaction.",
    "I am not quite a fool.",
    "\u201cAll the same\u201d I said gravely \u201cI think we shall.\u201d\n\u201cWhy\u201d\nI shook my head unable to explain the feeling that had actuated my words.",
    "\u201cI never wish to see you again\u201d he said suddenly and violently.",
    "It was really a very rude thing to say but I only laughed softly and slipped away into the\ndarkness.",
    "I heard him start after me and then pause and a word floated down the deck.",
    "I think it\nwas \u201cwitch\u201d\n\n\fSeventeen\nExtract from the diary of Sir Eustace Pedler\n\nMount Nelson Hotel Cape Town.",
    "It is really the greatest relief to get off the Kilmorden.",
    "The whole time that I was onboard\nI was conscious of being surrounded by a network of intrigue.",
    "To put the lid on\neverything Guy Pagett must needs engage in a drunken brawl the last night.",
    "It is all very\nwell to explain it away but that is what it actually amounts to.",
    "What else would you think\nif a man comes to you with a lump the size of an egg on the side of his head and an eye\ncoloured all the tints of the rainbow\nOf course Pagett would insist on trying to be mysterious about the whole thing.",
    "According to him you would think his black eye was the direct result of his devotion to\nmy interests.",
    "His story was extraordinarily vague and rambling and it was a long time\nbefore I could make head or tail of it.",
    "To begin with it appears he caught sight of a man behaving suspiciously.",
    "Those are\nPagett\u2019s words.",
    "He has taken them straight from the pages of a German spy story.",
    "What\nhe means by a man behaving suspiciously he doesn\u2019t know himself.",
    "I said so to him.",
    "\u201cHe was slinking along in a very furtive manner and it was the middle of the night Sir\nEustace.\u201d\n\u201cWell what were you doing yourself Why weren\u2019t you in bed and asleep like a good\nChristian\u201d I demanded irritably.",
    "\u201cI had been coding those cables of yours Sir Eustace and typing the diary up to\ndate.\u201d\nTrust Pagett to be always in the right and a martyr over it\n\u201cWell\u201d\n\u201cI just thought I would have a look round before turning in Sir Eustace.",
    "The man was\ncoming down the passage from your cabin.",
    "I thought at once there was something wrong\nby the way he looked about him.",
    "He slunk up the stairs by the saloon.",
    "I followed him.",
    "\u201cMy dear Pagett\u201d I said \u201cwhy shouldn\u2019t the poor chap go on deck without having his\nfootsteps dogged Lots of people even sleep on deck\u2014very uncomfortable I\u2019ve always\nthought.",
    "The sailors wash you down with the rest of the deck at five in the morning.\u201d I\nshuddered at the idea.",
    "\u201cAnyway\u201d I continued \u201cif you went worrying some poor devil who was suffering from\ninsomnia I don\u2019t wonder he landed you one.\u201d\n\n\fPagett looked patient.",
    "\u201cIf you would hear me out Sir Eustace.",
    "I was convinced the man had been prowling\nabout near your cabin where he had no business to be.",
    "The only two cabins down that\npassage are yours and Colonel Race\u2019s.\u201d\n\u201cRace\u201d I said lighting a cigar carefully \u201ccan look after himself without your\nassistance Pagett.\u201d I added as an afterthought \u201cSo can I.\u201d\nPagett came nearer and breathed heavily as he always does before imparting a secret.",
    "\u201cYou see Sir Eustace I fancied\u2014and now indeed I am sure\u2014it was Rayburn.\u201d\n\u201cRayburn\u201d\n\u201cYes Sir Eustace.\u201d\nI shook my head.",
    "\u201cRayburn has far too much sense to attempt to wake me up in the middle of the night.\u201d\n\u201cQuite so Sir Eustace.",
    "I think it was Colonel Race he went to see.",

    "Your idea is absurd.",
    "Why should they want to have a secret meeting in the\nmiddle of the night If they\u2019d anything to say to each other they could hobnob over beef\ntea in a perfectly casual and natural manner.\u201d\nI could see that Pagett was not in the least convinced.",
    "\u201cSomething was going on last night Sir Eustace\u201d he urged \u201cor why should Rayburn\nassault me so brutally\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re quite sure it was Rayburn\u201d\nPagett appeared to be perfectly convinced of that.",
    "It was the only part of the story that\nhe wasn\u2019t vague about.",
    "\u201cThere\u2019s something very queer about all this\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cTo begin with where is\nRayburn\u201d\nIt\u2019s perfectly true that we haven\u2019t seen the fellow since we came onshore.",
    "He did not\ncome up to the hotel with us.",
    "I decline to believe that he is afraid of Pagett however.",
    "Altogether the whole thing is very annoying.",

    "I can\u2019t take him about with\nme in his present condition.",
    "I shall be the laughingstock of Cape Town.",
    "I have an\nappointment later in the day to deliver old Milray\u2019s billetdoux but I shall not take\nPagett with me.",
    "Confound the fellow and his prowling ways.",
    "Although I am decidedly out of temper.",
    "I had a poisonous breakfast with poisonous\npeople.",
    "Dutch waitresses with thick ankles who took half an hour to bring me a bad bit of\nfish.",
    "And this farce of getting up at 5 am on arrival at the port to see a blinking doctor\nand hold your hands above your head simply makes me tired.",
    "Later.",
    "A very serious thing has occurred.",
    "I went to my appointment with the Prime Minister\ntaking Milray\u2019s sealed letter.",
    "It didn\u2019t look as though it had been tampered with but\ninside was a blank sheet of paper\nNow I suppose I\u2019m in the devil of a mess.",

    "Pagett is a famous Job\u2019s comforter.",
    "He displays a certain gloomy satisfaction that\nmaddens me.",
    "Also he had taken advantage of my perturbation to saddle me with the\nstationery trunk.",
    "Unless he is careful the next funeral he attends will be his own.",
    "However in the end I had to listen to him.",
    "\u201cSupposing Sir Eustace that Rayburn had overheard a word or two of your\nconversation with Mr. Milray in the street Remember you had no written authority\nfrom Mr. Milray.",
    "You accepted Rayburn on his own valuation.\u201d\n\u201cYou think Rayburn is a crook then\u201d I said slowly.",
    "Pagett did.",
    "How far his views were influenced by resentment over his black eye I don\u2019t\nknow.",
    "He made out a pretty fair case against Rayburn.",
    "And the appearance of the latter\ntold against him.",
    "My idea was to do nothing in the matter.",
    "A man who has permitted\nhimself to be made a thorough fool of is not anxious to broadcast the fact.",
    "But Pagett his energy unimpaired by his recent misfotunes was all for vigorous\nmeasures.",
    "He had his way of course.",
    "He bustled out to the police station sent\ninnumerable cables and brought a herd of English and Dutch officials to drink whiskies\nand sodas at my expense.",

    "\u201cI must have been very drunk if I asked Race.",
    "Very drunk indeed.",
    "Take my advice\nPagett and let your black eye be a warning to you don\u2019t go on the bust again.\u201d\n\u201cAs you know I am a teetotaller Sir Eustace.\u201d\n\u201cMuch wiser to take the pledge if you have a weakness that way.",

    "She can\ntypewrite I know for she told me so.\u201d\n\n\fTo my surprise Pagett opposed the idea vehemently.",
    "He does not like Anne\nBeddingfeld.",
    "Ever since the night of the black eye he has displayed uncontrollable\nemotion whenever she is mentioned.",

    "I went right up to the boat deck which I believe is a\nheinous offence but I decided to dare something in the cause of solitude.",
    "We were just\nsteaming into Table Bay.",
    "There were fleecy white clouds hovering above Table Mountain\nand nestling on the slopes below right down to the sea was the sleeping town gilded and\nbewitched by the morning sunlight.",
    "It made me catch my breath and have that curious hungry pain inside that seizes one\nsometimes when one comes across something that\u2019s extra beautiful.",
    "I\u2019m not very good at\nexpressing these things but I knew well enough that I had found if only for a fleeting\nmoment the thing that I had been looking for ever since I left Little Hampsley.",
    "Something\nnew something hitherto undreamed of something that satisfied my aching hunger for\nromance.",

    "You\u2019re seeing the world.\u201d\nI had thought that I had the boat deck to myself but now I observed another figure leaning\nover the rail absorbed as I had been in the rapidly approaching city.",
    "Even before he turned\nhis head I knew who it was.",
    "The scene of last night seemed unreal and melodramatic in the\npeaceful morning sunshine.",

    "\u201cI want to apologize to you.",
    "I behaved like a perfect boor last night.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2014it was a peculiar night\u201d I said hastily.",
    "It was not a very lucid remark but it was absolutely the only thing I could think of.",

    "All the\nsame I\u2019m taking a sporting chance that he won\u2019t speak.\u201d\n\u201cWhy\u201d\n\u201cBecause he\u2019s a man who likes playing a lone hand.",

    "I felt that I should hear them always.",
    "Footsteps\u2014going out of my life.",
    "I can admit frankly that I did not enjoy the next two hours.",
    "Not till I stood on the wharf\nhaving finished with most of the ridiculous formalities that bureaucracies require did I\nbreathe freely once more.",
    "No arrest had been made and I realized that it was a heavenly\nday and that I was extremely hungry.",

    "The boat did not go on to Port Elizabeth and Durban until the following\nmorning.",
    "We got into a taxi and drove to the Mount Nelson.",
    "It was all heavenly.",
    "The sun the air the flowers When I thought of Little Hampsley in\nJanuary the mud kneedeep and the suretobefalling rain I hugged myself with delight.",
    "Suzanne was not nearly so enthusiastic.",
    "She has travelled a great deal of course.",
    "Besides\nshe is not the type that gets excited before breakfast.",
    "She snubbed me severely when I let out\nan enthusiastic yelp at the sight of a giant blue convolvulus.",
    "By the way I should like to make clear here and now that this story will not be a story of\nSouth Africa.",
    "I guarantee no genuine local colour\u2014you know the sort of thing\u2014half a dozen\nwords in italics on every page.",

    "Then again there are pawpaws.",
    "I had\noften read of pawpaws.",
    "I discovered at once what they were because I had one plumped\ndown in front of me for breakfast.",
    "I thought at first that it was a melon gone bad.",
    "The Dutch\nwaitress enlightened me and persuaded me to use lemon juice and sugar and try again.",
    "I\nwas very pleased to meet a pawpaw.",
    "I had always vaguely associated it with a hulahula\nwhich I believe though I may be wrong is a kind of straw skirt that Hawaiian girls dance\nin.",
    "No I think I am wrong\u2014that is a lavalava.",
    "At any rate all these things are very cheering after England.",
    "I can\u2019t help thinking that it\nwould brighten our cold Island life if one could have a breakfast of baconbacon and then\ngo out clad in a jumperjumper to pay the books.",
    "Suzanne was a little tamer after breakfast.",
    "They had given me a room next to hers with a\nlovely view right out over Table Bay.",
    "I looked at the view whilst Suzanne hunted for some\nspecial facecream.",
    "When she had found it and started an immediate application she became\ncapable of listening to me.",

    "\u201cHe was marching out of the breakfast room as we\nwent in.",
    "He\u2019d had some bad fish or something and was just telling the headwaiter what he\nthought about it and he bounced a peach on the floor to show how hard it was\u2014only it\nwasn\u2019t quite as hard as he thought and it squashed.\u201d\nSuzanne smiled.",
    "\u201cSir Eustace doesn\u2019t like getting up early any more than I do.",
    "But Anne did you see Mr.\nPagett I ran against him in the passage.",
    "He\u2019s got a black eye.",
    "What can he have been\ndoing\u201d\n\u201cOnly trying to push me overboard\u201d I replied nonchalantly.",
    "It was a distinct score for me.",
    "Suzanne left her face halfanointed and pressed for details.",
    "I gave them to her.",
    "\u201cIt all gets more and more mysterious\u201d she cried.",
    "\u201cI thought I was going to have the soft\njob sticking to Sir Eustace and that you would have all the fun with the Rev.",
    "Edward\nChichester but now I\u2019m not so sure.",
    "I hope Pagett won\u2019t push me off the train some dark\nnight.\u201d\n\u201cI think you\u2019re still above suspicion Suzanne.",
    "But if the worst happens I\u2019ll wire to\nClarence.\u201d\n\u201cThat reminds me\u2014give me a cable form.",
    "Let me see now what shall I say \u2018Implicated\nin the most thrilling mystery please send me a thousand pounds at once Suzanne.\u2019 \u201d\nI took the form from her and pointed out that she could eliminate a \u201cthe\u201d an \u201ca\u201d and\npossibly if she didn\u2019t care about being polite a \u201cplease.\u201d Suzanne however appears to be\nperfectly reckless in money matters.",
    "Instead of attending to my economical suggestions she\nadded three more words \u201cenjoying myself hugely.\u201d\nSuzanne was engaged to lunch with friends of hers who came to the hotel about eleven\no\u2019clock to fetch her.",
    "I was left to my own devices.",
    "I went down through the grounds of the\nhotel crossed the tramlines and followed a cool shady avenue right down till I came to the\nmain street.",
    "I strolled about seeing the sights enjoying the sunlight and the blackfaced\nsellers of flowers and fruits.",
    "I also discovered a place where they had the most delicious\nice cream sodas.",
    "Finally I bought a sixpenny basket of peaches and retraced my steps to the\nhotel.",
    "To my surprise and pleasure I found a note awaiting me.",
    "It was from the curator of the\nMuseum.",
    "He had read of my arrival on the Kilmorden in which I was described as the\n\n\fdaughter of the late Professor Beddingfeld.",
    "He had known my father slightly and had had\ngreat admiration for him.",
    "He went on to say that his wife would be delighted if I would\ncome out and have tea with them that afternoon at their Villa at Muizenberg.",
    "He gave me\ninstructions for getting there.",
    "It was pleasant to think that poor Papa was still remembered and highly thought of.",
    "I\nforesaw that I would have to be personally escorted round the Museum before I left Cape\nTown but I risked that.",
    "To most people it would have been a treat\u2014but one can have too\nmuch of a good thing if one is brought up on it morning noon and night.",
    "I put on my best hat one of Suzanne\u2019s castoffs and my least crumpled white linen and\nstarted off after lunch.",
    "I caught a fast train to Muizenberg and got there in about half an hour.",
    "It was a nice trip.",
    "We wound slowly round the base of Table Mountain and some of the\nflowers were lovely.",
    "My geography being weak I had never fully realized that Cape Town\nis on a peninsula consequently I was rather surprised on getting out of the train to find\nmyself facing the sea once more.",
    "There was some perfectly entrancing bathing going on.",
    "The\npeople had short curved boards and came floating in on the waves.",
    "It was far too early to go\nto tea.",
    "I made for the bathing pavilion and when they said would I have a surfboard I said\n\u201cYes please.\u201d Surfing looks perfectly easy.",
    "It isn\u2019t.",
    "I say no more.",
    "I got very angry and\nfairly hurled my plank from me.",
    "Nevertheless I determined to return on the first possible\nopportunity and have another go.",
    "I would not be beaten.",
    "Quite by mistake I then got a good\nrun on my board and came out delirious with happiness.",
    "Surfing is like that.",
    "You are either\nvigorously cursing or else you are idiotically pleased with yourself.",
    "I found the Villa Medgee after some difficulty.",
    "It was right up on the side of the mountain\nisolated from the other cottages and villas.",
    "I rang the bell and a smiling Kafir boy answered\nit.",
    "\u201cMrs.",
    "Raffini\u201d I inquired.",
    "He ushered me in preceded me down the passage and flung open a door.",
    "Just as I was\nabout to pass in I hesitated.",
    "I felt a sudden misgiving.",
    "I stepped over the threshold and the\ndoor swung sharply behind me.",
    "A man rose from his seat behind a table and came forward with outstretched hand.",
    "\u201cSo glad we have persuaded you to visit us Miss Beddingfeld\u201d he said.",
    "He was a tall man obviously a Dutchman with a flaming orange beard.",
    "He did not look\nin the least like the curator of a museum.",
    "In fact I realized in a flash that I had made a fool\nof myself.",
    "I was in the hands of the enemy.",
    "Nineteen\n\nIt reminded me forcibly of Episode III in \u201cThe Perils of Pamela.\u201d How often had I not sat\nin the sixpenny seats eating a twopenny bar of milk chocolate and yearning for similar\nthings to happen to me Well they had happened with a vengeance.",
    "And somehow it was not\nnearly so amusing as I had imagined.",
    "It\u2019s all very well on the screen\u2014you have the\ncomfortable knowledge that there\u2019s bound to be an Episode IV.",
    "But in real life there was\nabsolutely no guarantee that Anna the Adventuress might not terminate abruptly at the end of\nany Episode.",
    "Yes I was in a tight place.",
    "All the things that Rayburn had said that morning came back to\nme with unpleasant distinctness.",
    "Tell the truth he had said.",
    "Well I could always do that but\nwas it going to help me To begin with would my story be believed Would they consider\nit likely or possible that I had started off on this mad escapade simply on the strength of a\nscrap of paper smelling of mothballs It sounded to me a wildly incredible tale.",
    "In that\nmoment of cold sanity I cursed myself for a melodramatic idiot and yearned for the\npeaceful boredom of Little Hampsley.",
    "All this passed through my mind in less time than it takes to tell.",
    "My first instinctive\nmovement was to step backwards and feel for the handle of the door.",
    "My captor merely\ngrinned.",
    "\u201cHere you are and here you stay\u201d he remarked facetiously.",
    "I did my best to put a bold face upon the matter.",
    "\u201cI was invited to come here by the curator of the Cape Town Museum.",
    "If I have made a\nmistake\u2014\u201d\n\u201cA mistake Oh yes a big mistake\u201d\nHe laughed coarsely.",
    "\u201cWhat right have you to detain me I shall inform the police\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYap yap yap\u2014like a little toy dog.\u201d He laughed.",
    "I sat down on a chair.",
    "\u201cI can only conclude that you are a dangerous lunatic\u201d I said coldly.",
    "\u201cIndeed\u201d\n\u201cI should like to point out to you that my friends are perfectly well aware where I have\ngone and that if I have not returned by this evening they will come in search of me.",
    "You\n\n\funderstand\u201d\n\u201cSo your friends know where you are do they Which of them\u201d\nThus challenged I did a lightning calculation of chances.",
    "Should I mention Sir Eustace\nHe was a wellknown man and his name might carry weight.",
    "But if they were in touch with\nPagett they might know I was lying.",
    "Better not risk Sir Eustace.",
    "\u201cMrs.",
    "Blair for one\u201d I said lightly.",
    "\u201cA friend of mine with whom I am staying.\u201d\n\u201cI think not\u201d said my captor slyly shaking his orange head.",
    "\u201cYou have not seen her since\neleven this morning.",
    "And you received our note bidding you to come here at lunchtime.\u201d\nHis words showed me how closely my movements had been followed but I was not\ngoing to give in without a fight.",
    "\u201cYou are very clever\u201d I said.",
    "\u201cPerhaps you have heard of that useful invention the\ntelephone Mrs. Blair called me up on it when I was resting in my room after lunch.",
    "I told\nher then where I was going this afternoon.\u201d\nTo my great satisfaction I saw a shade of uneasiness pass over his face.",
    "Clearly he had\noverlooked the possibility that Suzanne might have telephoned me.",
    "I wished she really had\ndone so\n\u201cEnough of this\u201d he said harshly rising.",
    "\u201cWhat are you going to do with me\u201d I asked still endeavouring to appear composed.",
    "\u201cPut you where you can do no harm in case your friends come after you.\u201d\nFor a moment my blood ran cold but his next words reassured me.",
    "\u201cTomorrow you\u2019ll have some questions to answer and after you\u2019ve answered them we\nshall know what to do with you.",
    "And I can tell you young lady we\u2019ve more ways than one\nof making obstinate little fools talk.\u201d\nIt was not cheering but it was at least a respite.",
    "I had until tomorrow.",
    "This man was\nclearly an underling obeying the orders of a superior.",
    "Could that superior by any chance be\nPagett\nHe called and two Kafirs appeared.",
    "I was taken upstairs.",
    "Despite my struggles I was\ngagged and then bound hand and foot.",
    "The room into which they had taken me was a kind of\nattic right under the roof.",
    "It was dusty and showed little signs of having been occupied.",
    "The\nDutchman made a mock bow and withdrew closing the door behind him.",
    "I was quite helpless.",
    "Turn and twist as I would I could not loosen my bonds in the\nslightest degree and the gag prevented me from crying out.",
    "If by any possible chance\nanyone did come to the house I could do nothing to attract their attention.",
    "Down below I\nheard the sound of a door shutting.",
    "Evidently the Dutchman was going out.",
    "It was maddening not to be able to do anything.",
    "I strained again at my bonds but the knots\nheld.",
    "I desisted at last and either fainted or fell asleep.",
    "When I awoke I was in pain all\nover.",
    "It was quite dark now and I judged that the night must be welladvanced for the moon\nwas high in the heavens and shining down through the dusty skylight.",
    "The gag was half\nchoking me and the stiffness and pain were unendurable.",
    "It was then that my eyes fell on a bit of broken glass lying in the corner.",
    "A moonbeam\nslanted right down on it and its glistening had caught my attention.",
    "As I looked at it an idea\ncame into my head.",
    "My arms and legs were helpless but surely I could still roll.",
    "Slowly and awkwardly I\nset myself in motion.",
    "It was not easy.",
    "Besides being extremely painful since I could not\nguard my face with my arms it was also exceedingly difficult to keep any particular\ndirection.",
    "I tended to roll in every direction except the one I wanted to go.",
    "In the end however I\ncame right up against my objective.",
    "It almost touched my bound hands.",
    "Even then it was not easy.",
    "It took an infinity of time before I could wriggle the glass into\nsuch a position wedged against the wall that it would rub up and down on my bonds.",
    "It was\na long heartrending process and I almost despaired but in the end I succeeded in sawing\nthrough the cords that bound my wrists.",
    "The rest was a matter of time.",
    "Once I had restored\nthe circulation to my hands by rubbing the wrists vigorously I was able to undo the gag.",
    "One or two full breaths did a lot for me.",
    "Very soon I had undone the last knot though even then it was some time before I could\nstand on my feet but at last I stood erect swinging my arms to and fro to restore the\ncirculation and wishing above all things that I could get hold of something to eat.",
    "I waited about a quarter of an hour to be quite sure of my recovered strength.",
    "Then I\ntiptoed noiselessly to the door.",
    "As I had hoped it was not locked only latched.",
    "I unlatched\nit and peeped cautiously out.",
    "Everything was still.",
    "The moonlight came in through a window and showed me the dusty\nuncarpeted staircase.",
    "Cautiously I crept down it.",
    "Still no sound\u2014but as I stood on the\nlanding below a faint murmur of voices reached me.",
    "I stopped dead and stood there for\nsome time.",
    "A clock on the wall registered the fact that it was after midnight.",
    "I was fully aware of the risks I might run if I descended lower but my curiosity was too\nmuch for me.",
    "With infinite precautions I prepared to explore.",
    "I crept softly down the last\nflight of stairs and stood in the square hall.",
    "I looked round me\u2014and then caught my breath\nwith a gasp.",
    "A Kafir boy was sitting by the hall door.",
    "He had not seen me indeed I soon\nrealized by his breathing that he was fast asleep.",
    "Should I retreat or should I go on The voices came from the room I had been shown into\non arrival.",
    "One of them was that of my Dutch friend the other I could not for the moment\n\n\frecognize though it seemed vaguely familiar.",
    "In the end I decided that it was clearly my duty to hear all I could.",
    "I must risk the Kafir\nboy waking up.",
    "I crossed the hall noiselessly and knelt by the study door.",
    "For a moment or\ntwo I could hear no better.",
    "The voices were louder but I could not distinguish what they\nsaid.",
    "I applied my eye to the keyhole instead of my ear.",
    "As I had guessed one of the speakers\nwas the big Dutchman.",
    "The other man was sitting outside my circumscribed range of vision.",
    "Suddenly he rose to get himself a drink.",
    "His back blackclad and decorous came into\nview.",
    "Even before he turned round I knew who he was.",
    "Mr. Chichester\nNow I began to make out the words.",
    "\u201cAll the same it is dangerous.",

    "\u201cIt would be simple.",
    "The boat is all\nready.",

    "\u201cThat is what I should do.",

    "But the \u2018Colonel\u2019 is a man who likes to play a lone hand\u2014though no one else\nmust do so.\u201d Something in his own words seemed to awaken a memory that annoyed him.",

    "\u201cAnd now\u201d continued Chichester \u201cgive me the lists.\u201d\nFor a long time their conversation was quite incomprehensible to me.",
    "It seemed to deal\nwith large quantities of vegetables.",

    "Is\nshe securely tied up\u201d\nThe Dutchman laughed.",
    "\u201cWhat do you think\u201d\nThey both laughed.",
    "So did I under my breath.",
    "Then as the sounds seemed to betoken that\nthey were about to come out of the room I beat a hasty retreat.",
    "I was just in time.",
    "As I\nreached the head of the stairs I heard the door of the room open and at the same time the\nKafir stirred and moved.",
    "My retreat by the way of the hall door was not to be thought of.",
    "I\nretired prudently to the attic gathered my bonds round me and lay down again on the floor\nin case they should take it into their heads to come and look at me.",
    "They did not do so however.",
    "After about an hour I crept down the stairs but the Kafir by\nthe door was awake and humming softly to himself.",
    "I was anxious to get out of the house but\nI did not quite see how to manage it.",
    "In the end I was forced to retreat to the attic again.",

    "I must know if Chichester was on the boat.",
    "Whether to sail on her myself or not I\ncould not determine but in the end I decided to do so.",
    "Chichester would not know that I had\nseen him in the Villa at Muizenberg.",

    "And he was the man I was after the man who was seeking the diamonds on\nbehalf of the mysterious \u201cColonel.\u201d\nAlas for my plans As I arrived at the docks the Kilmorden Castle was steaming out to\nsea.",
    "And I had no means of knowing whether Chichester had sailed on her or not\n\n\fTwenty\n\nI drove to the hotel.",
    "There was no one in the lounge that I knew.",

    "\u201cWhy does no\none gag me and bind me hand and foot\u201d\n\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t like it if they did\u201d I assured her.",
    "\u201cTo tell you the truth I\u2019m not nearly so\nkeen on having adventures myself as I was.",
    "A little of that sort of thing goes a long way.\u201d\nSuzanne seemed unconvinced.",
    "An hour or two of gagging and binding would have\nchanged her view quickly enough.",
    "Suzanne likes thrills but she hates being uncomfortable.",

    "\u201cI don\u2019t quite know\u201d I said thoughtfully.",
    "\u201cYou still go to Rhodesia of course to keep an\neye on Pagett\u2014\u201d\n\u201cAnd you\u201d\nThat was just my difficulty.",
    "Had Chichester gone on the Kilmorden or had he not Did he\nmean to carry out his original plan of going to Durban The hour of his leaving Muizenberg\nseemed to point to an affirmative answer to both questions.",
    "In that case I might go to\nDurban by train.",
    "I fancied that I should get there before the boat.",
    "On the other hand if the\nnews of my escape were wired to Chichester and also the information that I had left Cape\nTown for Durban nothing was simpler for him than to leave the boat at either Port Elizabeth\nor East London and so give me the slip completely.",
    "It was rather a knotty problem.",
    "\u201cWe\u2019ll inquire about trains to Durban anyway\u201d I said.",
    "\u201cAnd it\u2019s not too late for morning tea\u201d said Suzanne.",
    "\u201cWe\u2019ll have it in the lounge.\u201d\nThe Durban train left at 815 that evening so they told me at the office.",

    "\u201cHis makeup\nis perfectly marvellous.",
    "He might come off the boat as a navvy or something and you\u2019d\nnever spot him.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re very cheering\u201d I said.",
    "At that minute Colonel Race stepped in through the window and came and joined us.",
    "\u201cWhat is Sir Eustace doing\u201d asked Suzanne.",
    "\u201cI haven\u2019t seen him about today.\u201d\nRather an odd expression passed over the Colonel\u2019s face.",

    "Rayburn he called himself.\u201d\n\u201cHave they arrested him\u201d asked Suzanne.",
    "Under the table she gave my hand a reassuring\nsqueeze.",

    "We were awakened from a refreshing afternoon nap by a page boy with a note.",
    "In\n\n\ftouching terms it requested the pleasure of our company at tea in his sitting room.",
    "The poor man was indeed in a pitiable state.",

    "She does that sort of thing very well.",

    "Why my house Why of all the houses in\nGreat Britain choose the Mill House What harm had I ever done the woman that she must\nneeds get herself murdered there\u201d\nSuzanne made one of her sympathetic noises again and Sir Eustace proceeded in a still\nmore aggrieved tone\n\u201cAnd if that\u2019s not enough the fellow who murdered her has the impudence the colossal\nimpudence to attach himself to me as my secretary.",
    "My secretary if you please I\u2019m tired of\nsecretaries I won\u2019t have any more secretaries.",
    "Either they\u2019re concealed murderers or else\nthey\u2019re drunken brawlers.",
    "Have you seen Pagett\u2019s black eye But of course you have.",
    "How\ncan I go about with a secretary like that And his face is such a nasty shade of yellow too\u2014\njust the colour that doesn\u2019t go with a black eye.",
    "I\u2019ve done with secretaries\u2014unless I have a\ngirl.",
    "A nice girl with liquid eyes who\u2019ll hold my hand when I\u2019m feeling cross.",

    "That\u2019s the sort of\nthing that suits Pagett down to the ground.",
    "He adores intrigue.",

    "Will you come Mrs. Blair here is a competent chaperone and you can have a half\nholiday every now and again to dig for bones.\u201d\n\u201cThank you very much Sir Eustace\u201d I said cautiously \u201cbut I think I\u2019m leaving for Durban\ntonight.\u201d\n\u201cNow don\u2019t be an obstinate girl.",

    "You\u2019ll\nlike lions.",
    "All girls do.\u201d\n\u201cWill they be practising low jumps\u201d I asked laughing.",
    "\u201cNo thank you very much but I\nmust go to Durban.\u201d\nSir Eustace looked at me sighed deeply then opened the door of the adjoining room and\ncalled to Pagett.",
    "\u201cIf you\u2019ve quite finished your afternoon sleep my dear fellow perhaps you\u2019d do a little\nwork for a change.\u201d\nGuy Pagett appeared in the doorway.",

    "Go down to the Trade Commissioner\u2019s Office or the Board of\nAgriculture or the Chamber of Mines or one of those places and ask them to lend me some\nkind of a woman to take to Rhodesia.",
    "She must have liquid eyes and not object to my\nholding her hand.\u201d\n\u201cYes Sir Eustace.",
    "I will ask for a competent shorthandtypist.\u201d\n\u201cPagett\u2019s a malicious fellow\u201d said Sir Eustace after the secretary had departed.",

    "Pagett is\nstaying behind here\u2014you heard that\u201d\n\u201cYes.",
    "I suppose that means that I shan\u2019t be allowed to go to Rhodesia\u2014which is very\nannoying because I want to go to Rhodesia.",
    "How tiresome.\u201d\n\u201cCheer up\u201d I said.",
    "\u201cYou\u2019re going all right.",
    "I don\u2019t see how you could back out at the last\nmoment without its appearing frightfully suspicious.",
    "And besides Pagett might suddenly be\nsummoned by Sir Eustace and it would be far harder for you to attach yourself to him for\nthe journey up.\u201d\n\u201cIt would hardly be respectable\u201d said Suzanne dimpling.",
    "\u201cI should have to pretend a\nfatal passion for him as an excuse.\u201d\n\u201cOn the other hand if you were there when he arrived it would all be perfectly simple\nand natural.",

    "\u201cI don\u2019t say I seriously suspect either\nof them but after all the woman was murdered in Sir Eustace\u2019s house\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYes yes we needn\u2019t go over all that again.",
    "I\u2019ll watch him for you Anne and if he gets\n\n\fany fatter and any more cheerful I\u2019ll send you a telegram at once.",
    "\u2018Sir E. swelling highly\nsuspicious.",

    "\u201cI might.",
    "It would have to be a very long one.\u201d Her eyes brightened at the thought.",

    "But I think it\u2019s carrying it rather far to suspect Colonel\nRace I do indeed.",
    "Why he\u2019s something to do with the Secret Service.",
    "Do you know Anne\nI believe the best thing we could do would be to confide in him and tell him the whole\nstory.\u201d\nI objected vigorously to this unsporting proposal.",

    "However she promised faithfully that she would not breathe a word to Colonel Race\nand we went on with our plan making.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s quite clear that I must stay here and watch Pagett and this is the best way to do it.",
    "I\nmust pretend to leave for Durban this evening take my luggage down and so on but really I\nshall go to some small hotel in the town.",
    "I can alter my appearance a little\u2014wear a fair\ntoupee and one of those thick white lace veils and I shall have a much better chance of\nseeing what he\u2019s really at if he thinks I\u2019m safely out of the way.\u201d\nSuzanne approved this plan heartily.",
    "We made due and ostentatious preparations\ninquiring once more about the departure of the train at the office and packing my luggage.",
    "We dined together in the restaurant.",
    "Colonel Race did not appear but Sir Eustace and\nPagett were at their table in the window.",
    "Pagett left the table halfway through the meal\n\n\fwhich annoyed me as I had planned to say goodbye to him.",

    "I stood helpless not daring to look at Suzanne.",
    "The man suspected.",
    "He was determined to make sure that I did go by the train.",
    "And what\ncould I do Nothing.",
    "I saw myself in a quarter of an hour\u2019s time steaming out of the station\nwith Pagett planted on the platform waving me adieu.",
    "He had turned the tables on me\nadroitly.",
    "His manner towards me had changed moreover.",
    "It was full of an uneasy geniality\nwhich sat ill upon him and which nauseated me.",
    "The man was an oily hypocrite.",
    "First he\ntried to murder me and now he paid me compliments Did he imagine for one minute that I\nhadn\u2019t recognized him that night on the boat No it was a pose a pose which he forced me\nto acquiesce in his tongue in his cheek all the while.",
    "Helpless as a sheep I moved along under his expert directions.",

    "It was twelve minutes past\neight.",
    "In three minutes the train would start.",
    "But Pagett had reckoned without Suzanne.",
    "\u201cIt will be a terribly hot journey Anne\u201d she said suddenly.",
    "\u201cEspecially going through the\nKaroo tomorrow.",
    "You\u2019ve got some eaudeCologne or lavender water with you haven\u2019t\nyou\u201d\nMy cue was plain.",
    "\u201cOh dear\u201d I cried.",
    "\u201cI left my eaudeCologne on the dressing table at the hotel.\u201d\nSuzanne\u2019s habit of command served her well.",
    "She turned imperiously to Pagett.",
    "\u201cMr.",
    "Pagett.",
    "Quick.",
    "You\u2019ve just time.",
    "There\u2019s a chemist almost opposite the station.",
    "Anne\nmust have some eaudeCologne.\u201d\n\n\fHe hesitated but Suzanne\u2019s imperative manner was too much for him.",
    "She is a born\nautocrat.",
    "He went.",
    "Suzanne followed him with her eyes till he disappeared.",
    "\u201cQuick Anne get out the other side\u2014in case he hasn\u2019t really gone but is watching us\nfrom the end of the platform.",
    "Never mind your luggage.",
    "You can telegraph about that\ntomorrow.",
    "Oh if only the train starts on time\u201d\nI opened the gate on the opposite side to the platform and climbed down.",
    "Nobody was\nobserving me.",
    "I could just see Suzanne standing where I had left her looking up at the train\nand apparently chatting to me at the window.",
    "A whistle blew the train began to draw out.",
    "Then I heard feet racing furiously up the platform.",
    "I withdrew to the shadow of a friendly\nbookstall and watched.",
    "Suzanne turned from waving her handkerchief to the retreating train.",
    "\u201cToo late Mr. Pagett\u201d she said cheerfully.",
    "\u201cShe\u2019s gone.",
    "Is that the eaudeCologne\nWhat a pity we didn\u2019t think of it sooner\u201d\nThey passed not far from me on their way out of the station.",
    "Guy Pagett was extremely\nhot.",
    "He had evidently run all the way to the chemist and back.",
    "\u201cShall I get you a taxi Mrs. Blair\u201d\nSuzanne did not fail in her role.",
    "\u201cYes please.",
    "Can\u2019t I give you a lift back Have you much to do for Sir Eustace Dear\nme I wish Anne Beddingfeld was coming with us tomorrow.",
    "I don\u2019t like the idea of a young\ngirl like that travelling off to Durban all by herself.",
    "But she was set upon it.",
    "Some little\nattraction there I fancy\u2014\u201d\nThey passed out of earshot.",
    "Clever Suzanne.",
    "She had saved me.",
    "I allowed a minute or two to elapse and then I too made my way out of the station almost\ncolliding as I did so with a man\u2014an unpleasantlooking man with a nose disproportionately\nbig for his face.",
    "Twentyone\n\nI had no further difficulty in carrying out my plans.",
    "I found a small hotel in a back street got\na room there paid a deposit as I had no luggage with me and went placidly to bed.",
    "On the following morning I was up early and went out into the town to purchase a modest\nwardrobe.",
    "My idea was to do nothing until after the departure of the eleveno\u2019clock train to\nRhodesia with most of the party on board.",
    "Pagett was not likely to indulge in any nefarious\nactivities until he had got rid of them.",
    "Accordingly I took a train out of the town and\nproceeded to enjoy a country walk.",
    "It was comparatively cool and I was glad to stretch my\nlegs after the long voyage and my close confinement at Muizenberg.",
    "A lot hinges on small things.",
    "My shoelace came untied and I stopped to do it up.",
    "The\nroad had just turned a corner and as I was bending over the offending shoe a man came\nright round and almost walked into me.",
    "He lifted his hat murmuring an apology and went\non.",
    "It struck me at the time that his face was vaguely familiar but at the moment I thought no\nmore of it.",
    "I looked at my wristwatch.",
    "The time was getting on.",
    "I turned my feet in the\ndirection of Cape Town.",
    "There was a tram on the point of going and I had to run for it.",
    "I heard other footsteps\nrunning behind me.",
    "I swung myself on and so did the other runner.",
    "I recognized him at once.",
    "It was the man who had passed me on the road when my shoe came untied and in a flash I\nknew why his face was familiar.",
    "It was the small man with the big nose whom I had run into\non leaving the station the night before.",
    "The coincidence was rather startling.",
    "Could it be possible that the man was deliberately\nfollowing me I resolved to test that as promptly as possible.",
    "I rang the bell and got off at\nthe next stop.",
    "The man did not get off.",
    "I withdrew into the shadow of a shop doorway and\nwatched.",
    "He alighted at the next stop and walked back in my direction.",
    "The case was clear enough.",
    "I was being followed.",
    "I had crowed too soon.",
    "My victory\nover Guy Pagett took on another aspect.",
    "I hailed the next tram and as I expected my\nshadower also got on.",
    "I gave myself up to some very serious thinking.",
    "It was perfectly apparent that I had stumbled on a bigger thing than I knew.",
    "The murder in\nthe house at Marlow was not an isolated incident committed by a solitary individual.",
    "I was\nup against a gang and thanks to Colonel Race\u2019s revelations to Suzanne and what I had\noverheard at the house at Muizenberg I was beginning to understand some of its manifold\nactivities.",
    "Systematized crime organized by the man known to his followers as the\n\u201cColonel\u201d I remembered some of the talk I had heard on board ship of the strike on the\nRand and the causes underlying it\u2014and the belief that some secret organization was at work\n\n\ffomenting the agitation.",
    "That was the \u201cColonel\u2019s\u201d work his emissaries were acting\naccording to plan.",
    "He took no part in these things himself I had always heard as he limited\nhimself to directing and organizing.",
    "The brain work\u2014not the dangerous labour\u2014for him.",
    "But still it well might be that he himself was on the spot directing affairs from an apparently\nimpeccable position.",
    "That then was the meaning of Colonel Race\u2019s presence on the Kilmorden Castle.",
    "He\nwas out after the archcriminal.",
    "Everything fitted in with that assumption.",
    "He was someone\nhigh up in the Secret Service whose business it was to lay the \u201cColonel\u201d by the heels.",
    "I nodded to myself\u2014things were becoming very clear to me.",
    "What of my part in the\naffair Where did I come in Was it only diamonds they were after I shook my head.",
    "Great\nas the value of the diamonds might be they hardly accounted for the desperate attempts\nwhich had been made to get me out of the way.",
    "No I stood for more than that.",
    "In some way\nunknown to myself I was a menace a danger Some knowledge that I had or that they\nthought I had made them anxious to remove me at all costs\u2014and that knowledge was bound\nup somehow with the diamonds.",
    "There was one person I felt sure who could enlighten me\n\u2014if he would \u201cThe Man in the Brown Suit\u201d\u2014Harry Rayburn.",
    "He knew the other half of the\nstory.",
    "But he had vanished into the darkness he was a hunted creature flying from pursuit.",
    "In\nall probability he and I would never meet again. . . .",
    "I brought myself back with a jerk to the actualities of the moment.",
    "It was no good thinking\nsentimentally of Harry Rayburn.",
    "He had displayed the greatest antipathy to me from the first.",
    "Or at least\u2014There I was again\u2014dreaming The real problem was what to do\u2014now\nI priding myself upon my role of watcher had become the watched.",
    "And I was afraid\nFor the first time I began to lose my nerve.",
    "I was the little bit of grit that was impeding the\nsmooth working of the great machine\u2014and I fancied that the machine would have a short\nway with little bits of grit.",
    "Once Harry Rayburn had saved me once I had saved myself\u2014\nbut I felt suddenly that the odds were heavily against me.",
    "My enemies were all around me in\nevery direction and they were closing in.",
    "If I continued to play a lone hand I was doomed.",
    "I rallied myself with an effort.",
    "After all what could they do I was in a civilized city\u2014\nwith policemen every few yards.",
    "I would be wary in future.",
    "They should not trap me again\nas they had done in Muizenberg.",
    "As I reached this point in my meditations the tram arrived at Adderley Street.",
    "I got out.",
    "Undecided what to do I walked slowly up the lefthand side of the street.",
    "I did not trouble\nto look if my watcher was behind me.",
    "I knew he was.",
    "I walked into Cartwright\u2019s and\nordered two coffee ice cream sodas\u2014to steady my nerves.",
    "A man I suppose would have\nhad a stiff peg but girls derive a lot of comfort from ice cream sodas.",
    "I applied myself to\nthe end of the straw with gusto.",
    "The cool liquid went trickling down my throat in the most\nagreeable manner.",
    "I pushed the first glass aside empty.",
    "I was sitting on one of the little high stools in front of the counter.",
    "Out of the tail of my\n\n\feye I saw my tracker come in and sit down unostentatiously at a little table near the door.",
    "I\nfinished the second coffee soda and demanded a maple one.",
    "I can drink practically an\nunlimited amount of ice cream sodas.",
    "Suddenly the man by the door got up and went out.",
    "That surprised me.",
    "If he was going to\nwait ouside why not wait outside from the beginning I slipped down from my stool and\nwent cautiously to the door.",
    "I drew back quickly into the shadow.",
    "The man was talking to\nGuy Pagett.",
    "If I had ever had any doubts that would have settled it.",
    "Pagett had his watch out and was\nlooking at it.",
    "They exchanged a few brief words and then the secretary swung on down the\nstreet towards the station.",
    "Evidently he had given his orders.",
    "But what were they\nSuddenly my heart leapt into my mouth.",
    "The man who had followed me crossed to the\nmiddle of the road and spoke to a policeman.",
    "He spoke at some length gesticulating\ntowards Cartwright\u2019s and evidently explaining something.",
    "I saw the plan at once.",
    "I was to\nbe arrested on some charge or other\u2014pocketpicking perhaps.",
    "It would be easy enough for\nthe gang to put through a simple little matter like that.",
    "Of what good to protest my\ninnocence They would have seen to every detail.",
    "Long ago they had brought a charge of\nrobbing De Beers against Harry Rayburn and he had not been able to disprove it though I\nhad little doubt but that he had been absolutely blameless.",
    "What chance had I against such a\n\u201cframe up\u201d as the \u201cColonel\u201d could devise\nI glanced up at the clock almost mechanically and immediately another aspect of the case\nstruck me.",
    "I saw the point of Guy Pagett\u2019s looking at his watch.",
    "It was just on eleven and at\neleven the mail train left for Rhodesia bearing with it the influential friends who might\notherwise come to my rescue.",
    "That was the reason of my immunity up to now.",
    "From last\nnight till eleven this morning I had been safe but now the net was closing in upon me.",
    "I hurriedly opened my bag and paid for my drinks and as I did so my heart seemed to\nstand still for inside it was a man\u2019s wallet stuffed with notes It must have been deftly\nintroduced into my handbag as I left the tram.",
    "Promptly I lost my head.",
    "I hurried out of Cartwright\u2019s.",
    "The little man with the big nose\nand the policeman were just crossing the road.",
    "They saw me and the little man designated\nme excitedly to the policeman.",
    "I took to my heels and ran.",
    "I judged him to be a slow\npoliceman.",
    "I should get a start.",
    "But I had no plan even then.",
    "I just ran for my life down\nAdderley Street.",
    "People began to stare.",
    "I felt that in another minute someone would stop me.",
    "An idea flashed into my head.",
    "\u201cThe station\u201d I asked in a breathless gasp.",
    "\u201cJust down on the right.\u201d\nI sped on.",
    "It is permissible to run for a train.",
    "I turned into the station but as I did so I\n\n\fheard footsteps close behind me.",
    "The little man with the big nose was a champion sprinter.",
    "I\nforesaw that I should be stopped before I got to the platform I was in search of.",
    "I looked up\nto the clock\u2014one minute to eleven.",
    "I might just do it if my plan succeeded.",
    "I had entered the station by the main entrance in Adderley Street.",
    "I now darted out again\nthrough the side exit.",
    "Directly opposite me was the side entrance to the post office the main\nentrance to which is in Adderley Street.",
    "As I expected my pursuer instead of following me in ran down the street to cut me off\nwhen I emerged by the main entrance or to warn the policeman to do so.",
    "In an instant I slipped across the street again and back into the station.",
    "I ran like a lunatic.",
    "It was just eleven.",
    "The long train was moving as I appeared on the platform.",
    "A porter tried\nto stop me but I wriggled myself out of his grasp and sprang upon the footboard.",
    "I mounted\nthe two steps and opened the gate.",
    "I was safe The train was gathering way.",
    "We passed a man standing by himself at the end of the platform.",
    "I waved to him.",
    "\u201cGoodbye Mr. Pagett\u201d I shouted.",
    "Never have I seen a man more taken aback.",
    "He looked as though he had seen a ghost.",
    "In a minute or two I was having trouble with the conductor.",
    "But I took a lofty tone.",
    "\u201cI am Sir Eustace Pedler\u2019s secretary\u201d I said haughtily.",
    "\u201cPlease take me to his private\ncar.\u201d\nSuzanne and Colonel Race were standing on the rear observation platform.",
    "They both\nuttered an exclamation of utter surprise at seeing me.",
    "\u201cHullo Miss Anne\u201d cried Colonel Race \u201cwhere have you turned up from I thought\nyou\u2019d gone to Durban.",
    "What an unexpected person you are\u201d\nSuzanne said nothing but her eyes asked a hundred questions.",
    "\u201cI must report myself to my chief\u201d I said demurely.",
    "\u201cWhere is he\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s in the office\u2014middle compartment\u2014dictating at an incredible rate to the\nunfortunate Miss Pettigrew.\u201d\n\u201cThis enthusiasm for work is something new\u201d I commented.",
    "\u201cH\u2019m\u201d said Colonel Race.",
    "\u201cHis idea is I think to give her sufficient work to chain her\nto her typewriter in her own compartment for the rest of the day.\u201d\nI laughed.",
    "Then followed by the other two I sought out Sir Eustace.",
    "He was striding up\nand down the circumscribed space hurling a flood of words at the unfortunate secretary\nwhom I now saw for the first time.",
    "A tall square woman in drab clothing with pincenez\nand an efficient air.",
    "I judged that she was finding it difficult to keep pace with Sir Eustace\nfor her pencil was flying along and she was frowning horribly.",
    "I stepped into the compartment.",
    "\u201cCome aboard sir\u201d I said saucily.",
    "Sir Eustace paused dead in the middle of a complicated sentence on the labour situation\nand stared at me.",
    "Miss Pettigrew must be a nervous creature in spite of her efficient air for\nshe jumped as though she had been shot.",
    "\u201cGod bless my soul\u201d ejaculated Sir Eustace.",
    "\u201cWhat about the young man in Durban\u201d\n\u201cI prefer you\u201d I said softly.",
    "\u201cDarling\u201d said Sir Eustace.",
    "\u201cYou can start holding my hand at once.\u201d\nMiss Pettigrew coughed and Sir Eustace hastily withdrew his hand.",
    "\u201cAh yes\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cLet me see where were we Yes.",
    "Tylman Roos in his speech at\u2014\nWhat\u2019s the matter Why aren\u2019t you taking it down\u201d\n\u201cI think\u201d said Colonel Race gently \u201cthat Miss Pettigrew has broken her pencil.\u201d\nHe took it from her and sharpened it.",
    "Sir Eustace stared and so did I.",
    "There was\nsomething in Colonel Race\u2019s tone that I did not quite understand.",
    "Twentytwo\nExtract from the diary of Sir Eustace Pedler\n\nI am inclined to abandon my Reminiscences.",
    "Instead I shall write a short article entitled\n\u201cSecretaries I have had.\u201d As regards secretaries I seem to have fallen under a blight.",
    "At\none minute I have no secretaries at another I have too many.",
    "At the present minute I am\njourneying to Rhodesia with a pack of women.",
    "Race goes off with the two bestlooking of\ncourse and leaves me with the dud.",
    "That is what always happens to me\u2014and after all\nthis is my private car not Race\u2019s.",
    "Also Anne Beddingfeld is accompanying me to Rhodesia on the pretext of being my\ntemporary secretary.",
    "But all this afternoon she has been out on the observation platform\nwith Race exclaiming at the beauty of the Hex River Pass.",
    "It is true that I told her her\nprincipal duty would be to hold my hand.",
    "But she isn\u2019t even doing that.",
    "Perhaps she is\nafraid of Miss Pettigrew.",
    "I don\u2019t blame her if so.",
    "There is nothing attractive about Miss\nPettigrew\u2014she is a repellent female with large feet more like a man than a woman.",
    "There is something very mysterious about Anne Beddingfeld.",
    "She jumped onboard the\ntrain at the last minute puffing like a steam engine for all the world as though she\u2019s\nbeen running a race\u2014and yet Pagett told me that he\u2019d seen her off to Durban last night\nEither Pagett has been drinking again or else the girl must have an astral body.",
    "And she never explains.",

    "No.",

    "I shouldn\u2019t wonder if the world found some day that it had been grossly\ndeceived by Pagett.",
    "On the whole I think Rayburn was the best of the bunch.",
    "He never\nworried me or got in my way.",
    "Guy Pagett has had the impertinence to have the stationery\ntrunk put in here.",
    "None of us can move without falling over it.",
    "I went out on the observation platform just now expecting my appearance to be\ngreeted with hails of delight.",
    "Both the women were listening spellbound to one of Race\u2019s\ntraveller\u2019s tales.",
    "I shall label this car\u2014not \u201cSir Eustace Pedler and Party\u201d but\n\u201cColonel Race and Harem.\u201d\nThen Mrs. Blair must needs begin taking silly photographs.",
    "Every time we went round\na particularly appalling curve as we climbed higher and higher she snapped at the\nengine.",
    "\u201cYou see the point\u201d she cried delightedly.",
    "\u201cIt must be some curve if you can\n\n\fphotograph the front part of the train from the back and with the mountain background\nit will look awfully dangerous.\u201d\nI pointed out to her that no one could possibly tell it had been taken from the back of\nthe train.",
    "She looked at me pityingly.",

    "\u2018Taken from the train.",
    "Engine going round a curve.\u2019 \u201d\n\u201cYou could write that under any snapshot of a train\u201d I said.",

    "\u201cI think your fears are exaggerated Sir Eustace.",
    "There will be no great danger in\nJo\u2019burg.\u201d\nThe women immediately looked at him in the \u201cWhat a brave hero you are\u201d manner.",

    "Why are women so excited by anything to do with diamonds\nAt last Anne Beddingfeld has shed her veil of mystery.",
    "It seems that she\u2019s a newspaper\ncorrespondent.",
    "She sent an immense cable from De Aar this morning.",
    "To judge by the\njabbering that went on nearly all night in Mrs. Blair\u2019s cabin she must have been reading\naloud all her special articles for years to come.",
    "It seems that all along she\u2019s been on the track of \u201cThe Man in the Brown Suit.\u201d\nApparently she didn\u2019t spot him on the Kilmorden\u2014in fact she hardly had the chance but\nshe\u2019s now very busy cabling home \u201cHow I journeyed out with the Murderer\u201d and\ninventing highly fictitious stories of \u201cWhat he said to me\u201d etc.",
    "I know how these things\nare done.",
    "I do them myself in my Reminiscences when Pagett will let me.",
    "And of course\none of Nasby\u2019s efficient staff will brighten up the details still more so that when it\nappears in the Daily Budget Rayburn won\u2019t recognize himself.",
    "The girl\u2019s clever though.",
    "All on her own apparently she\u2019s ferreted out the identity of\nthe woman who was killed in my house.",
    "She was a Russian dancer called Nadina.",
    "I asked\nAnne Beddingfeld if she was sure of this.",
    "She replied that it was merely a deduction\u2014\nquite in the Sherlock Holmes manner.",
    "However I gather that she had cabled it home to\nNasby as a proved fact.",
    "Women have these intuitions\u2014I\u2019ve no doubt that Anne\nBeddingfeld is perfectly right in her guess\u2014but to call it a deduction is absurd.",
    "How she ever got on the staff of the Daily Budget is more than I can imagine.",
    "But she is\nthe kind of young woman who does these things.",
    "Impossible to withstand her.",
    "She is full\nof coaxing ways that mask an invincible determination.",
    "Look how she has got into my\nprivate car\nI am beginning to have an inkling why.",
    "Race said something about the police\n\n\fsuspecting that Rayburn would make for Rhodesia.",
    "He might just have got off by\nMonday\u2019s train.",
    "They telegraphed all along the line I presume and no one of his\ndescription was found but that says little.",
    "He\u2019s an astute young man and he knows\nAfrica.",
    "He\u2019s probably exquisitely disguised as an old Kafir woman\u2014and the simple\npolice continue to look for a handsome young man with a scar dressed in the height of\nEuropean fashion.",
    "I never did quite swallow that scar.",
    "Anyway Anne Beddingfeld is on his track.",
    "She wants the glory of discovering him for\nherself and the Daily Budget.",
    "Young women are very coldblooded nowadays.",
    "I hinted to\nher that it was an unwomanly action.",
    "She laughed at me.",
    "She assured me that did she run\nhim to earth her fortune was made.",
    "Race doesn\u2019t like it either I can see.",
    "Perhaps\nRayburn is on this train.",
    "If so we may all be murdered in our beds.",
    "I said so to Mrs.\nBlair\u2014but she seemed quite to welcome the idea and remarked that if I were murdered it\nwould be really a terrific scoop for Anne A scoop for Anne indeed\nTomorrow we shall be going through Bechuanaland.",
    "The dust will be atrocious.",
    "Also\nat every station little Kafir children come and sell you quaint wooden animals that they\ncarve themselves.",
    "Also mealie bowls and baskets.",
    "I am rather afraid that Mrs. Blair may\nrun amok.",
    "There is a primitive charm about these toys that I feel will appeal to her.",
    "Friday evening.",
    "As I feared.",
    "Mrs. Blair and Anne have bought fortynine wooden animals\n\n\fTwentythree\nAnne\u2019s Narrative Resumed\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed the journey up to Rhodesia.",
    "There was something new and exciting to\nsee every day.",
    "First the wonderful scenery of the Hex River valley then the desolate\ngrandeur of the Karoo and finally that wonderful straight stretch of line in Bechaunaland\nand the perfectly adorable toys the natives brought to sell.",
    "Suzanne and I were nearly left\nbehind at each station\u2014if you could call them stations.",
    "It seemed to me that the train just\nstopped whenever it felt like it and no sooner had it done so than a horde of natives\nmaterialized out of the empty landscape holding up mealie bowls and sugar canes and fur\nkarosses and adorable carved wooden animals.",
    "Suzanne began at once to make a collection\nof the latter.",
    "I imitated her example\u2014most of them cost a \u201ctiki\u201d threepence and each was\ndifferent.",
    "There were giraffes and tigers and snakes and a melancholylooking eland and\nabsurd little black warriors.",
    "We enjoyed ourselves enormously.",
    "Sir Eustace tried to restrain us\u2014but in vain.",
    "I still think it was a miracle we were not left\nbehind at some oasis of the line.",
    "South African trains don\u2019t hoot or get excited when they are\ngoing to start off again.",
    "They just glide quietly away and you look up from your bargaining\nand run for your life.",
    "Suzanne\u2019s amazement at seeing me climb upon the train at Cape Town can be imagined.",
    "We held an exhaustive survey of the situation on the first evening out.",
    "We talked half the\nnight.",
    "It had become clear to me that defensive tactics must be adopted as well as aggressive\nones.",
    "Travelling with Sir Eustace Pedler and his party I was fairly safe.",
    "Both he and\nColonel Race were powerful protectors and I judged that my enemies would not wish to\nstir up a hornet\u2019s nest about my ears.",
    "Also as long as I was near Sir Eustace I was more or\nless in touch with Guy Pagett\u2014and Guy Pagett was the heart of the mystery.",
    "I asked Suzanne\nwhether in her opinion it was possible that Pagett himself was the mysterious \u201cColonel.\u201d\nHis subordinate position was of course against the assumption but it had struck me once or\ntwice that for all his autocratic ways Sir Eustace was really very much influenced by his\nsecretary.",
    "He was an easygoing man and one whom an adroit secretary might be able to\ntwist round his little finger.",
    "The comparative obscurity of his position might in reality be\nuseful to him since he would be anxious to be well out of the limelight.",
    "Suzanne however negatived these ideas very strongly.",
    "She refused to believe that Guy\nPagett was the ruling spirit.",
    "The real head\u2014the \u201cColonel\u201d\u2014was somewhere in the\nbackground and had probably been already in Africa at the time of our arrival.",
    "I agreed that there was much to be said for her view but I was not entirely satisfied.",
    "For\nin each suspicious instance Pagett had been shown as the directing genius.",
    "It was true that\nhis personality seemed to lack the assurance and decision that one would expect from a\nmaster criminal\u2014but after all according to Colonel Race it was brain work only that this\nmysterious leader supplied and creative genius is often allied to a weak and timorous\nphysical constitution.",
    "\u201cThere speaks the Professor\u2019s daughter\u201d interrupted Suzanne when I had got to this point\nin my argument.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s true all the same.",
    "On the other hand Pagett may be the Grand Vizier so to speak of\nthe All Highest.\u201d I was silent for a minute or two and then went on musingly \u201cI wish I\nknew how Sir Eustace made his money\u201d\n\u201cSuspecting him again\u201d\n\u201cSuzanne I\u2019ve got into that state that I can\u2019t help suspecting somebody I don\u2019t really\nsuspect him\u2014but after all he is Pagett\u2019s employer and he did own the Mill House.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve always heard that he made his money in some way he isn\u2019t anxious to talk about\u201d\nsaid Suzanne thoughtfully.",
    "\u201cBut that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean crime\u2014it might be tintacks or\nhair restorer\u201d\nI agreed ruefully.",
    "\u201cI suppose\u201d said Suzanne doubtfully \u201cthat we\u2019re not barking up the wrong tree Being\nled completely astray I mean by assuming Pagett\u2019s complicity Supposing that after all he\nis a perfectly honest man\u201d\nI considered that for a minute or two then I shook my head.",
    "\u201cI can\u2019t believe that.\u201d\n\u201cAfter all he has his explanations for everything.\u201d\n\u201cY\u2014es but they\u2019re not very convincing.",
    "For instance the night he tried to throw me\noverboard on the Kilmorden he says he followed Rayburn up on deck and Rayburn turned\nand knocked him down.",
    "Now we know that\u2019s not true.\u201d\n\u201cNo\u201d said Suzanne unwillingly.",
    "\u201cBut we only heard the story at second hand from Sir\nEustace.",
    "If we\u2019d heard it direct from Pagett himself it might have been different.",
    "You know\nhow people always get a story a little wrong when they repeat it.\u201d\nI turned the thing over in my mind.",
    "\u201cNo\u201d I said at last \u201cI don\u2019t see any way out.",
    "Pagett\u2019s guilty.",
    "You can\u2019t get away from the\nfact that he tried to throw me overboard and everything else fits in.",
    "Why are you so\npersistent in this new idea of yours\u201d\n\n\f\u201cBecause of his face.\u201d\n\u201cHis face But\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYes I know what you\u2019re going to say.",
    "It\u2019s a sinister face.",
    "That\u2019s just it.",
    "No man with a\nface like that could be really sinister.",
    "It must be a colossal joke on the part of Nature.\u201d\nI did not believe much in Suzanne\u2019s argument.",
    "I know a lot about Nature in past ages.",
    "If\nshe\u2019s got a sense of humour she doesn\u2019t show it much.",
    "Suzanne is just the sort of person\nwho would clothe Nature with all her own attributes.",
    "We passed on to discuss our immediate plans.",
    "It was clear to me that I must have some\nkind of standing.",
    "I couldn\u2019t go on avoiding explanations forever.",
    "The solution of all my\ndifficulties lay ready to my hand though I didn\u2019t think of it for some time.",
    "The Daily\nBudget My silence or my speech could no longer affect Harry Rayburn.",
    "He was marked\ndown as \u201cThe Man in the Brown Suit\u201d through no fault of mine.",
    "I could help him best by\nseeming to be against him.",
    "The \u201cColonel\u201d and his gang must have no suspicion that there\nexisted any friendly feeling between me and the man they had elected to be the scapegoat of\nthe murder at Marlow.",
    "As far as I knew the woman killed was still unidentified.",
    "I would\ncable to Lord Nasby suggesting that she was no other than the famous Russian dancer\n\u201cNadina\u201d who had been delighting Paris for so long.",
    "It seemed incredible to me that she had\nnot been identified already\u2014but when I learnt more of the case long afterwards I saw how\nnatural it really was.",
    "Nadina had never been to England during her successful career in Paris.",
    "She was\nunknown to London audiences.",
    "The pictures in the papers of the Marlow victim were so\nblurred and unrecognizable that it is small wonder no one identified them.",
    "And on the other\nhand Nadina had kept her intention of visiting England a profound secret from everyone.",
    "The day after the murder a letter had been received by her manager purporting to be from\nthe dancer in which she said that she was returning to Russia on urgent private affairs and\nthat he must deal with her broken contract as best he could.",
    "All this of course I only learned afterwards.",
    "With Suzanne\u2019s full approval I sent a long\ncable from De Aar.",
    "It arrived at a psychological moment this again of course I learnt\nafterwards.",
    "The Daily Budget was hard up for a sensation.",
    "My guess was verified and\nproved to be correct and the Daily Budget had the scoop of its lifetime.",
    "\u201cVictim of the Mill\nHouse Murder identified by our special reporter.\u201d And so on.",
    "\u201cOur reporter makes voyage\nwith the murderer.",
    "The Man in the Brown Suit.",
    "What he is really like.\u201d\nThe main facts were of course cabled to the South African papers but I only read my\nown lengthy articles at a much later date I received approval and full instructions by cable\nat Bulawayo.",
    "I was on the staff of the Daily Budget and I had a private word of\ncongratulation from Lord Nasby himself.",
    "I was definitely accredited to hunt down the\nmurderer and I and only I knew that the murderer was not Harry Rayburn But let the\nworld think that it was he\u2014best so for the present.",
    "Twentyfour\n\nWe arrived at Bulawayo early on Saturday morning.",
    "I was disappointed in the place.",
    "It\nwas very hot and I hated the hotel.",
    "Also Sir Eustace was what I can only describe as\nthoroughly sulky.",
    "I think it was all our wooden animals that annoyed him\u2014especially the\nbig giraffe.",
    "It was a colossal giraffe with an impossible neck a mild eye and a dejected tail.",
    "It had character.",
    "It had charm.",
    "A controversy was already arising as to whom it belonged to\n\u2014me or Suzanne.",
    "We had each contributed a tiki to its purchase.",
    "Suzanne advanced the\nclaims of seniority and the married state I stuck to the position that I had been the first to\nbehold its beauty.",
    "In the meantime I must admit it occupied a good deal of this threedimensional space of\nours.",
    "To carry fortynine wooden animals all of awkward shape and all of extremely\nbrittle wood is somewhat of a problem.",
    "Two porters were laden with a bunch of animals\neach\u2014and one promptly dropped a ravishing group of ostriches and broke their heads off.",
    "Warned by this Suzanne and I carried all we could Colonel Race helped and I pressed the\nbig giraffe into Sir Eustace\u2019s arms.",
    "Even the correct Miss Pettigrew did not escape a large\nhippopotamus and two black warriors fell to her share.",
    "I had a feeling Miss Pettigrew\ndidn\u2019t like me.",
    "Perhaps she fancied I was a bold hussy.",
    "Anyway she avoided me as much as\nshe could.",
    "And the funny thing was her face seemed vaguely familiar to me though I\ncouldn\u2019t quite place it.",
    "We reposed ourselves most of the morning and in the afternoon we drove out to the\nMatopos to see Rhodes\u2019s grave.",
    "That is to say we were to have done so but at the last\nmoment Sir Eustace backed out.",
    "He was very nearly in as bad a temper as the morning we\narrived at Cape Town\u2014when he bounced the peaches on the floor and they squashed\nEvidently arriving early in the morning at places is bad for his temperament.",
    "He cursed the\nporters he cursed the waiter at breakfast he cursed the whole hotel management he would\ndoubtless have liked to curse Miss Pettigrew who hovered around with her pencil and pad\nbut I don\u2019t think even Sir Eustace would have dared to curse Miss Pettigrew.",
    "She\u2019s just like\nthe efficient secretary in a book.",
    "I only rescued our dear giraffe just in time.",
    "I feel Sir\nEustace would have liked to dash him to the ground.",
    "To return to our expedition after Sir Eustace had backed out Miss Pettigrew said she\nwould remain at home in case he might want her.",
    "And at the very last minute Suzanne sent\ndown a message to say she had a headache.",
    "So Colonel Race and I drove off alone.",
    "He is a strange man.",
    "One doesn\u2019t notice it so much in a crowd.",
    "But when one is alone\nwith him the sense of his personality seems really almost overpowering.",
    "He becomes more\n\n\ftaciturn and yet his silence seems to say more than speech might do.",
    "It was so that day that we drove to the Matopos through the soft yellowbrown scrub.",
    "Everything seemed strangely silent\u2014except our car which I should think was the first Ford\never made by man The upholstery of it was torn to ribbons and though I know nothing\nabout engines even I could guess that all was not as it should be in its interior.",
    "By and by the character of the country changed.",
    "Great boulders appeared piled up into\nfantastic shapes.",
    "I felt suddenly that I had got into a primitive era.",
    "Just for a moment\nNeanderthal men seemed quite as real to me as they had to Papa.",
    "I turned to Colonel Race.",
    "\u201cThere must have been giants once\u201d I said dreamily.",
    "\u201cAnd their children were just like\nchildren are today\u2014they played with handfuls of pebbles piling them up and knocking them\ndown and the more cleverly they balanced them the better pleased they were.",
    "If I were to\ngive a name to this place I should call it The Country of Giant Children.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps you\u2019re nearer the mark than you know\u201d said Colonel Race gravely.",
    "\u201cSimple\nprimitive big\u2014that is Africa.\u201d\nI nodded appreciatively.",
    "\u201cYou love it don\u2019t you\u201d I asked.",
    "\u201cYes.",
    "But to live in it long\u2014well it makes one what you would call cruel.",
    "One comes to\nhold life and death very lightly.\u201d\n\u201cYes\u201d I said thinking of Harry Rayburn.",
    "He had been like that too.",
    "\u201cBut not cruel to\nweak things\u201d\n\u201cOpinions differ as to what are and are not \u2018weak things\u2019 Miss Anne.\u201d\nThere was a note of seriousness in his voice which almost startled me.",
    "I felt that I knew\nvery little really of this man at my side.",
    "\u201cI meant children and dogs I think.\u201d\n\u201cI can truthfully say I\u2019ve never been cruel to children or dogs.",
    "So you don\u2019t class women\nas \u2018weak things\u2019 \u201d\nI considered.",
    "\u201cNo I don\u2019t think I do\u2014though they are I suppose.",
    "That is they are nowadays.",
    "But Papa\nalways said that in the beginning men and women roamed the world together equal in\nstrength\u2014like lions and tigers\u2014\u201d\n\u201cAnd giraffes\u201d interpolated Colonel Race slyly.",
    "I laughed.",
    "Everyone makes fun of that giraffe.",
    "\u201cAnd giraffes.",
    "They were nomadic you see.",
    "It wasn\u2019t till they settled down in\ncommunities and women did one kind of thing and men another that women got weak.",
    "And\n\n\fof course underneath one is still the same\u2014one feels the same I mean\u2014and that is why\nwomen worship physical strength in men it\u2019s what they once had and have lost.\u201d\n\u201cAlmost ancestor worship in fact\u201d\n\u201cSomething of the kind.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you really think that\u2019s true That women worship strength I mean\u201d\n\u201cI think it\u2019s quite true\u2014if one\u2019s honest.",
    "You think you admire moral qualities but when\nyou fall in love you revert to the primitive where the physical is all that counts.",
    "But I don\u2019t\nthink that\u2019s the end if you lived in primitive conditions it would be all right but you don\u2019t\n\u2014and so in the end the other thing wins after all.",
    "It\u2019s the things that are apparently\nconquered that always do win isn\u2019t it They win in the only way that counts.",
    "Like what the\nBible says about losing your life and finding it.\u201d\n\u201cIn the end\u201d said Colonel Race thoughtfully \u201cyou fall in love\u2014and you fall out of it is\nthat what you mean\u201d\n\u201cNot exactly but you can put it that way if you like.\u201d\n\u201cBut I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve ever fallen out of love Miss Anne\u201d\n\u201cNo I haven\u2019t\u201d I admitted frankly.",
    "\u201cOr fallen in love either\u201d\nI did not answer.",
    "The car drew up at our destination and brought the conversation to a close.",
    "We got out\nand began the slow ascent to the World\u2019s View.",
    "Not for the first time I felt a slight\ndiscomfort in Colonel Race\u2019s company.",
    "He veiled his thoughts so well behind those\nimpenetrable black eyes.",
    "He frightened me a little.",
    "He had always frightened me.",
    "I never\nknew where I stood with him.",
    "We climbed in silence till we reached the spot where Rhodes lies guarded by giant\nboulders.",
    "A strange eerie place far from the haunts of men that sings a ceaseless paean of\nrugged beauty.",
    "We sat there for time in silence.",
    "Then descended once more but diverging slightly from\nthe path.",
    "Sometimes it was a rough scramble and once we came to a sharp slope or rock that\nwas almost sheer.",
    "Colonel Race went first then turned to help me.",
    "\u201cBetter lift you\u201d he said suddenly and swung me off my feet with a quick gesture.",
    "I felt the strength of him as he set me down and released his clasp.",
    "A man of iron with\nmuscles like taut steel.",
    "And again I felt afraid especially as he did not move aside but\nstood directly in front of me staring into my face.",
    "\u201cWhat are you really doing here Anne Beddingfeld\u201d he said abruptly.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m a gipsy seeing the world.\u201d\n\u201cYes that\u2019s true enough.",
    "The newspaper correspondent is only a pretext.",
    "You\u2019ve not the\nsoul of a journalist.",
    "You\u2019re out for your own hand\u2014snatching at life.",
    "But that\u2019s not all.\u201d\nWhat was he going to make me tell him I was afraid\u2014afraid.",
    "I looked him full in the\nface.",
    "My eyes can\u2019t keep secrets like his but they can carry the war into the enemy\u2019s\ncountry.",
    "\u201cWhat are you really doing here Colonel Race\u201d I asked deliberately.",
    "For a moment I thought he wasn\u2019t going to answer.",
    "He was clearly taken aback though.",
    "At last he spoke and his words seemed to afford him a grim amusement.",
    "\u201cPursuing ambition\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cJust that\u2014pursuing ambition.",
    "You will remember Miss\nBeddingfeld that \u2018by that sin fell the angels\u2019 etc.\u201d\n\u201cThey say\u201d I said slowly \u201cthat you are really connected with the Government\u2014that you\nare in the Secret Service.",
    "Is that true\u201d\nWas it my fancy or did he hesitate for a fraction of a second before he answered\n\u201cI can assure you Miss Beddingfeld that I am out here strictly as a private individual\ntravelling for my own pleasure.\u201d\nThinking the answer over later it struck me as slightly ambiguous.",
    "Perhaps he meant it to\nbe so.",
    "We rejoined the car in silence.",
    "Halfway back to Bulawayo we stopped for tea at a\nsomewhat primitive structure at the side of the road.",
    "The proprietor was digging in the\ngarden and seemed annoyed at being disturbed.",
    "But he graciously promised to see what he\ncould do.",
    "After an interminable wait he brought us some stale cakes and some lukewarm\ntea.",
    "Then disappeared to his garden again.",
    "No sooner had he departed than we were surrounded by cats six of them all miaowing\npiteously at once.",
    "The racket was deafening.",
    "I offered them some pieces of cake.",
    "They\ndevoured them ravenously.",
    "I poured all the milk there was into a saucer and they fought each\nother to get it.",
    "\u201cOh\u201d I cried indignantly \u201cthey\u2019re starved It\u2019s wicked.",
    "Please please order some more\nmilk and another plate of cake.\u201d\nColonel Race departed silently to do my bidding.",
    "The cats had begun miaowing again.",
    "He\nreturned with a big jug of milk and the cats finished it all.",

    "These cats are alive.",
    "I shall take them back with me.\u201d\n\u201cYou will do nothing of the kind.\u201d I looked at him resentfully but he went on \u201cYou think\nme cruel\u2014but one can\u2019t go through life sentimentalizing over these things.",
    "It\u2019s no good\nstanding out\u2014I shan\u2019t allow you to take them.",
    "It\u2019s a primitive country you know and I\u2019m\nstronger than you.\u201d\nI always know when I am beaten.",
    "I went down to the car with tears in my eyes.",

    "And he\nwas the man I feared most Still I could waste no more time.",
    "I slipped quickly out of the\n\n\fhotel and took the path to the bridge.",
    "I crossed it and stood there waiting in the shadow.",
    "If anyone had followed me I should\nsee them crossing the bridge.",
    "But the minutes passed and no one came.",
    "I had not been\nfollowed.",
    "I turned and took the path to the clearing.",
    "I took six paces or so and then stopped.",
    "Something had rustled behind me.",
    "It could not be anyone who had followed me from the\nhotel.",
    "It was someone who was already here waiting.",
    "And immediately without rhyme or reason but with the sureness of instinct I knew that it\nwas I myself who was threatened.",
    "It was the same feeling as I had had on the Kilmorden that\nnight\u2014a sure instinct warning me of danger.",
    "I looked sharply over my shoulder.",
    "Silence.",

    "I heard him pounding behind.",
    "I ran\nquicker keeping my eyes fixed on the white stones that showed me where to step for there\nwas no moon that night.",
    "And suddenly my foot felt nothingness.",
    "I heard the man behind me laugh an evil sinister\nlaugh.",
    "It rang in my ears as I fell headlong\u2014down\u2014down\u2014down to destruction far\nbeneath.",
    "Twentyfive\n\nI came to myself slowly and painfully.",

    "Nightmare visions floated before me.",
    "I felt myself falling\u2014falling again.",
    "Once Harry\nRayburn\u2019s face seemed to come to me out of the mist.",
    "Almost I imagined it real.",
    "Then it\nfloated away again mocking me.",
    "Once I remember someone put a cup to my lips and I\ndrank.",
    "A black face grinned into mine\u2014a devil\u2019s face I thought it and screamed out.",
    "Then\ndreams again\u2014long troubled dreams in which I vainly sought Harry Rayburn to warn him\u2014\nwarn him\u2014what of I did not know myself.",
    "But there was some danger\u2014some great danger\n\u2014and I alone could save him.",
    "Then darkness again merciful darkness and real sleep.",
    "I woke at last myself again.",
    "The long nightmare was over.",
    "I remembered perfectly\neverything that had happened my hurried flight from the hotel to meet Harry the man in the\nshadows and the last terrible moment of falling. . . .\nBy some miracle or other I had not been killed.",
    "I was bruised and aching and very weak\nbut I was alive.",
    "But where was I Moving my head with difficulty I looked round me.",
    "I was\nin a small room with rough wooden walls.",
    "On them were huge skins of animals and various\ntusks of ivory.",
    "I was lying on a kind of rough couch also covered with skins and my left\narm was bandaged up and felt stiff and uncomfortable.",
    "At first I thought I was alone and\nthen I saw a man\u2019s figure sitting between me and the light his head turned towards the\nwindow.",
    "He was so still that he might have been carved out of wood.",
    "Something in the\nclosecropped black head was familiar to me but I did not dare to let my imagination run\nastray.",
    "Suddenly he turned and I caught my breath.",
    "It was Harry Rayburn.",
    "Harry Rayburn in\nthe flesh.",
    "He rose and came over to me.",
    "\u201cFeeling better\u201d he said a trifle awkwardly.",
    "I could not answer.",
    "The tears were running down my face.",
    "I was weak still but I held his\nhand in both of mine.",
    "If only I could die like this whilst he stood there looking down on me\nwith that new look in his eyes.",

    "Please don\u2019t cry.",
    "You\u2019re safe now.",
    "No one shall hurt you.\u201d\nHe went and fetched a cup and brought it to me.",
    "\u201cDrink some of this milk.\u201d\nI drank obediently.",
    "He went on talking in a low coaxing tone such as he might have used\nto a child.",
    "\u201cDon\u2019t ask any more questions now.",
    "Go to sleep again.",
    "You\u2019ll be stronger by and by.",

    "\u201cNo no.\u201d\n\u201cThen I\u2019ll stay.\u201d\nHe brought a small stool over beside me and sat there.",
    "He laid his hand over mine and\nsoothed and comforted I dropped off to sleep once more.",
    "It must have been evening then but when I woke again the sun was high in the heavens.",
    "I\nwas alone in the hut but as I stirred an old native woman came running in.",
    "She was hideous\nas sin but she grinned at me encouragingly.",
    "She brought me water in a basin and helped me\nwash my face and hands.",
    "Then she brought me a large bowl of soup and I finished it every\ndrop I asked her several questions but she only grinned and nodded and chattered away in\na guttural language so I gathered she knew no English.",
    "Suddenly she stood up and drew back respectfully as Harry Rayburn entered.",
    "He gave her\na nod of dismissal and she went out leaving us alone.",
    "He smiled at me.",

    "But for your clothes catching on the branches you would\ncertainly have been dashed to pieces.\u201d\nI shuddered.",

    "What about the note then\u201d\n\u201cWhat note\u201d\n\u201cThe note you sent me asking me to meet you in the clearing.\u201d\nHe stared at me.",
    "\u201cI sent no note.\u201d\nI felt myself flushing up to the roots of my hair.",
    "Fortunately he did not seem to notice.",
    "\u201cHow did you come to be on the spot in such a marvellous manner\u201d I asked in as\nnonchalant a manner as I could assume.",
    "\u201cAnd what are you doing in this part of the world\nanyway\u201d\n\u201cI live here\u201d he said simply.",
    "\u201cOn this island\u201d\n\u201cYes I came here after the War.",
    "Sometimes I take parties from the hotel out in my boat\nbut it costs me very little to live and mostly I do as I please.\u201d\n\u201cYou live here all alone\u201d\n\u201cI am not pining for society I assure you\u201d he replied coldly.",
    "\u201cI am sorry to have inflicted mine upon you\u201d I retorted \u201cbut I seem to have had very\nlittle to say in the matter.\u201d\nTo my surprise his eyes twinkled a little.",
    "\u201cNone whatever.",
    "I slung you across my shoulders like a sack of coal and carried you to\nmy boat.",
    "Quite like a primitive man of the Stone Age.\u201d\n\u201cBut for a different reason\u201d I put in.",
    "He flushed this time a deep burning blush.",
    "The tan of his face was suffused.",

    "In the end I took the boat and came ashore and tramped down towards the Falls.",
    "I\n\n\fwas just at the head of the palm gully when I heard you scream.\u201d\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you get help from the hotel instead of carting me all the way here\u201d I asked.",
    "He flushed again.",
    "\u201cI suppose it seems an unpardonable liberty to you\u2014but I don\u2019t think that even now you\nrealize your danger You think I should have informed your friends Pretty friends who\nallowed you to be decoyed out to death.",
    "No I swore to myself that I\u2019d take better care of\nyou than anyone else could.",
    "Not a soul comes to this island.",

    "\u201cGod help me so you are\u201d he muttered and went abruptly out.",
    "My recovery was rapid.",
    "The two injuries I had sustained were a knock on the head and a\nbadly wrenched arm.",
    "The latter was the most serious and to begin with my rescuer had\nbelieved it to be actually broken.",
    "A careful examination however convinced him that it\nwas not so and although it was very painful I was recovering the use of it quite quickly.",
    "It was a strange time.",

    "His father as you know was one of South Africa\u2019s most\nprominent men.",
    "We drifted together at once my friend and I.",
    "We had our love of South\nAfrica in common and we both had a taste for the untrodden places of the world.",
    "After he\nleft Cambridge Eardsley had a final quarrel with his father.",
    "The old man had paid his debts\ntwice he refused to do so again.",
    "There was a bitter scene between them.",
    "Sir Laurence\ndeclared himself at the end of his patience\u2014he would do no more for his son.",
    "He must stand\non his own legs for a while.",
    "The result was as you know that those two young men went off\nto South America together prospecting for diamonds.",
    "I\u2019m not going into that now but we\nhad a wonderful time out there.",
    "Hardships in plenty you understand but it was a good life\n\u2014a handtomouth scramble for existence far from the beaten track\u2014and my God that\u2019s the\nplace to know a friend.",
    "There was a bond forged between us two out there that only death\ncould have broken.",
    "Well as Colonel Race told you our efforts were crowned with success.",
    "We found a second Kimberley in the heart of the British Guiana jungles.",
    "I can\u2019t tell you our\nelation.",
    "It wasn\u2019t so much the actual value in money of the find\u2014you see Eardsley was\nused to money and he knew that when his father died he would be a millionaire and Lucas\nhad always been poor and was used to it.",
    "No it was the sheer delight of discovery.\u201d\nHe paused and then added almost apologetically.",
    "\u201cYou don\u2019t mind my telling it this way do you As though I wasn\u2019t in it at all.",
    "It seems\nlike that now when I look back and see those two boys.",
    "I almost forget that one of them was\n\u2014Harry Rayburn.\u201d\n\u201cTell it any way you like\u201d I said and he went on\n\n\f\u201cWe came to Kimberley\u2014very cockahoop over our find.",
    "We brought a magnificent\nselection of diamonds with us to submit to the experts.",
    "And then\u2014in the hotel at Kimberley\n\u2014we met her\u2014\u201d\nI stiffened a little and the hand that rested on the doorpost clenched itself involuntarily.",
    "\u201cAnita Gr\u00fcnberg\u2014that was her name.",
    "She was an actress.",
    "Quite young and very\nbeautiful.",
    "She was South African born but her mother was a Hungarian I believe.",
    "There\nwas some sort of mystery about her and that of course heightened her attraction for two\nboys home from the wilds.",
    "She must have had an easy task.",
    "We both fell for her right away\nand we both took it hard.",
    "It was the first shadow that had ever come between us\u2014but even\nthen it didn\u2019t weaken our friendship.",
    "Each of us I honestly believe was willing to stand\naside for the other to go in and win.",
    "But that wasn\u2019t her game.",
    "Sometimes afterwards I\nwondered why it hadn\u2019t been for Sir Laurence Eardsley\u2019s only son was quite a parti.",
    "But\nthe truth of it was that she was married\u2014to a sorter in De Beers\u2014though nobody knew of it.",
    "She pretended enormous interest in our discovery and we told her all about it and even\nshowed her the diamonds.",
    "Delilah\u2014that\u2019s what she should have been called\u2014and she\nplayed her part well\n\u201cThe De Beers robbery was discovered and like a thunderclap the police came down\nupon us.",
    "They seized our diamonds.",
    "We only laughed at first\u2014the whole thing was so\nabsurd.",
    "And then the diamonds were produced in court\u2014and without question they were the\nstones stolen from De Beers.",
    "Anita Gr\u00fcnberg had disappeared.",
    "She had effected the\nsubstitution neatly enough and our story that these were not the stones originally in our\npossession was laughed to scorn.",
    "\u201cSir Laurence Eardsley had enormous influence.",
    "He succeeded in getting the case\ndismissed\u2014but it left two young men ruined and disgraced to face the world with the stigma\nof thief attached to their name and it pretty well broke the old fellow\u2019s heart.",
    "He had one\nbitter interview with his son in which he heaped upon him every reproach imaginable.",
    "He\nhad done what he could to save the family name but from that day on his son was his son no\nlonger.",
    "He cast him off utterly.",
    "And the boy like the proud young fool that he was remained\nsilent disdaining to protest his innocence in the face of his father\u2019s disbelief.",
    "He came out\nfurious from the interview\u2014his friend was waiting for him.",
    "A week later war was\ndeclared.",
    "The two friends enlisted together.",
    "You know what happened.",
    "The best pal a man\never had was killed partly through his own mad recklessness in rushing into unnecessary\ndanger.",
    "He died with his name tarnished. . . .\n\u201cI swear to you Anne that it was mainly on his account that I was so bitter against that\nwoman.",
    "It had gone deeper with him than with me.",
    "I had been madly in love with her for the\nmoment\u2014I even think that I frightened her sometimes\u2014but with him it was a quieter and\ndeeper feeling.",
    "She had been the very centre of his universe\u2014and her betrayal of him tore\nup the very roots of life.",
    "The blow stunned him and left him paralysed.\u201d\n\n\fHarry paused.",
    "After a minute or two he went on\n\u201cAs you know I was reported \u2018Missing presumed killed.\u2019 I never troubled to correct the\nmistake.",
    "I took the name of Parker and came to this island which I knew of old.",
    "At the\nbeginning of the War I had had ambitious hopes of proving my innocence but now all that\nspirit seemed dead.",
    "All I felt was \u2018What\u2019s the good\u2019 My pal was dead neither he nor I\nhad any living relations who would care.",
    "I was supposed to be dead too let it remain at\nthat.",
    "I led a peaceful existence here neither happy nor unhappy\u2014numbed of all feeling.",
    "I\nsee now though I did not realize it at the time that that was partly the effect of the War.",
    "\u201cAnd then one day something occurred to wake me right up again.",
    "I was taking a party of\npeople in my boat on a trip up the river and I was standing at the landing stage helping\nthem in when one of the men uttered a startled exclamation.",
    "It focused my attention on him.",
    "He was a small thin man with a beard and he was staring at me for all he was worth as\nthough I was a ghost.",
    "So powerful was his emotion that it awakened my curiosity.",
    "I made\ninquiries about him at the hotel and learned that his name was Carton that he came from\nKimberley and that he was a diamondsorter employed by De Beers.",
    "In a minute all the old\nsense of wrong surged over me again.",
    "I left the island and went to Kimberley.",
    "\u201cI could find out little more about him however.",
    "In the end I decided that I must force an\ninterview.",
    "I took my revolver with me.",
    "In the brief glimpse I had had of him I had realized\nthat he was a physical coward.",
    "No sooner were we face to face than I recognized that he\nwas afraid of me.",
    "I soon forced him to tell me all he knew.",
    "He had engineered part of the\nrobbery and Anita Gr\u00fcnberg was his wife.",
    "He had once caught sight of both of us when we\nwere dining with her at the hotel and having read that I was killed my appearance in the\nflesh at the Falls had startled him badly.",
    "He and Anita had married quite young but she had\nsoon drifted away from him.",
    "She had got in with a bad lot he told me\u2014and it was then for\nthe first time that I heard of the \u2018Colonel.\u2019 Carton himself had never been mixed up in\nanything except this one affair\u2014so he solemnly assured me and I was inclined to believe\nhim.",
    "He was emphatically not of the stuff of which successful criminals are made.",
    "\u201cI still had the feeling that he was keeping back something.",
    "As a test I threatened to shoot\nhim there and then declaring that I cared very little what became of me now.",
    "In a frenzy of\nterror he poured out a further story.",
    "It seems that Anita Gr\u00fcnberg did not quite trust the\n\u2018Colonel.\u2019 Whilst pretending to hand over to him the stones she had taken from the hotel she\nkept back some in her own possession.",
    "Carton advised her with his technical knowledge\nwhich to keep.",
    "If at any time these stones were produced they were of such colour and\nquality as to be readily identifiable and the experts at De Beers would admit at once that\nthese stones had never passed through their hands.",
    "In this way my story of a substitution\nwould be supported my name would be cleared and suspicion would be diverted to the\nproper quarter.",
    "I gathered that contrary to his usual practice the \u2018Colonel\u2019 himself had been\nconcerned in this affair therefore Anita felt satisfied that she had a real hold over him\nshould she need it.",
    "Carton now proposed that I should make a bargain with Anita Gr\u00fcnberg\n\n\for Nadina as she now called herself.",
    "For a sufficient sum of money he thought that she\nwould be willing to give up the diamonds and betray her former employer.",
    "He would cable\nto her immediately.",
    "\u201cI was still suspicious of Carton.",
    "He was a man whom it was easy enough to frighten but\nwho in his fright would tell so many lies that to sift the truth out from them would be no\neasy job.",
    "I went back to the hotel and waited.",
    "By the following evening I judged that he\nwould have received the reply to his cable.",
    "I called round to his house and was told that Mr.\nCarton was away but would be returning on the morrow.",
    "Instantly I became suspicious.",
    "In\nthe nick of time I found out that he was in reality sailing for England on the Kilmorden\nCastle which left Cape Town in two days\u2019 time.",
    "I had just time to journey down and catch\nthe same boat.",
    "\u201cI had no intention of alarming Carton by revealing my presence on board.",
    "I had done a\ngood deal of acting in my time at Cambridge and it was comparatively easy for me to\ntransform myself into a grave bearded gentleman of middle age.",
    "I avoided Carton carefully\non board the boat keeping to my own cabin as far as possible under the pretence of illness.",
    "\u201cI had no difficulty in trailing him when we got to London.",
    "He went straight to an hotel\nand did not go out until the following day.",
    "He left the hotel shortly before one o\u2019clock.",
    "I was\nbehind him.",
    "He went straight to a house agent in Knightsbridge.",
    "There he asked for\nparticulars of houses to let on the river.",
    "\u201cI was at the next table also inquiring about houses.",
    "Then suddenly in walked Anita\nGr\u00fcnberg Nadina\u2014whatever you like to call her.",
    "Superb insolent and almost as beautiful\nas ever.",
    "God how I hated her.",
    "There she was the woman who had ruined my life\u2014and who\nhad also ruined a better life than mine.",
    "At that minute I could have put my hands round her\nneck and squeezed the life out of her inch by inch Just for a minute or two I saw red.",
    "I\nhardly took in what the agent was saying.",
    "It was her voice that I heard next high and clear\nwith an exaggerated foreign accent \u2018The Mill House Marlow.",
    "The property of Sir Eustace\nPedler.",
    "That sounds as though it might suit me.",
    "At any rate I will go and see it.\u201d\n\u201cThe man wrote her an order and she walked out again in her regal insolent manner.",
    "Not\nby word or a sign had she recognized Carton yet I was sure that their meeting there was a\npreconceived plan.",
    "Then I started to jump to conclusions.",
    "Not knowing that Sir Eustace was\nat Cannes I thought that this househunting business was a mere pretext for meeting him in\nthe Mill House.",
    "I knew that he had been in South Africa at the time of the robbery and never\nhaving seen him I immediately leaped to the conclusion that he himself was the mysterious\n\u2018Colonel\u2019 of whom I had heard so much.",
    "\u201cI followed my two suspects along Knightsbridge.",
    "Nadina went into the Hyde Park Hotel.",
    "I quickened my pace and went in also.",
    "She walked straight into the restaurant and I decided\nthat I would not risk her recognizing me at the moment but would continue to follow Carton.",
    "I was in great hopes that he was going to get the diamonds and that by suddenly appearing\n\n\fand making myself known to him when he least expected it I might startle the truth out of\nhim.",
    "I followed him down into the Tube station at Hyde Park Corner.",
    "He was standing by\nhimself at the end of the platform.",
    "There was some girl standing near but no one else.",
    "I\ndecided that I would accost him then and there.",
    "You know what happened.",
    "In the sudden\nshock of seeing a man whom he imagined far away in South Africa he lost his head and\nstepped back upon the line.",
    "He was always a coward.",
    "Under the pretext of being a doctor I\nmanaged to search his pockets.",
    "There was a wallet with some notes in it and one or two\nunimportant letters there was a roll of films\u2014which I must have dropped somewhere later\n\u2014and there was a piece of paper with an appointment made on it for the 22nd on the\nKilmorden Castle.",
    "In my haste to get away before anyone detained me I dropped that also\nbut fortunately I remembered the figures.",
    "\u201cI hurried to the nearest cloak room and hastily removed my makeup.",
    "I did not want to be\nlaid by the heels for picking a dead man\u2019s pocket.",
    "Then I retraced my steps to the Hyde Park\nHotel.",
    "Nadina was still having lunch.",
    "I needn\u2019t describe in detail how I followed her down\nto Marlow.",
    "She went into the house and I spoke to the woman at the lodge pretending that I\nwas with her.",
    "Then I too went in.",
    "He stopped.",
    "There was a tense silence.",
    "\u201cYou will believe me Anne won\u2019t you I swear before God that what I am going to say\nis true.",
    "I went into the house after her with something very like murder in my heart\u2014and she\nwas dead I found her in that firstfloor room\u2014God It was horrible.",
    "Dead\u2014and I was not\nmore than three minutes behind her.",
    "And there was no sign of anyone else in the house Of\ncourse I realized at once the terrible position I was in.",
    "By one masterstroke the blackmailed\nhad rid himself of the blackmailer and at the same time had provided a victim to whom the\ncrime would be ascribed.",
    "The hand of the \u2018Colonel\u2019 was very plain.",
    "For the second time I\nwas to be his victim.",
    "Fool that I had been to walk into the trap so easily\n\u201cI hardly know what I did next.",
    "I managed to go out of the place looking fairly normal but\nI knew that it could not be long before the crime was discovered and a description of my\nappearance telegraphed all over the country.",
    "\u201cI lay low for some days not daring to make a move.",
    "In the end chance came to my aid.",
    "I\noverheard a conversation between two middleaged gentlemen in the street one of whom\nproved to be Sir Eustace Pedler.",

    "The fragment of conversation I had overheard gave me my clue.",
    "I was now no\nlonger so sure that Sir Eustace Pedler was the \u2018Colonel.\u2019 His house might have been\nappointed as a rendezvous by accident or for some obscure motive that I had not fathomed.\u201d\n\u201cDo you know\u201d I interrupted \u201cthat Guy Pagett was in Marlow at the date of the murder\u201d\n\u201cThat settles it then.",
    "I thought he was at Cannes with Sir Eustace.\u201d\n\u201cHe was supposed to be in Florence\u2014but he certainly never went there.",
    "I\u2019m pretty\n\n\fcertain he was really in Marlow but of course I can\u2019t prove it.\u201d\n\u201cAnd to think I never suspected Pagett for a minute until the night he tried to throw you\noverboard.",
    "The man\u2019s a marvellous actor.\u201d\n\u201cYes isn\u2019t he\u201d\n\u201cThat explains why the Mill House was chosen.",
    "Pagett could probably get in and out of it\nunobserved.",
    "Of course he made no objection to my accompanying Sir Eustace across in the\nboat.",
    "He didn\u2019t want me laid by the heels immediately.",
    "You see evidently Nadina didn\u2019t\nbring the jewels with her to the rendezvous as they had counted on her doing.",
    "I fancy that\nCarton really had them and concealed them somewhere on the Kilmorden Castle\u2014that\u2019s\nwhere he came in.",
    "They hoped that I might have some clue as to where they were hidden.",
    "As\nlong as the \u2018Colonel\u2019 did not recover the diamonds he was still in danger\u2014hence his\nanxiety to get them at all costs.",
    "Where the devil Carton hid them\u2014if he did hide them\u2014I\ndon\u2019t know.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s another story\u201d I quoted.",
    "\u201cMy story.",
    "And I\u2019m going to tell it to you now.\u201d\n\n\fTwentyseven\n\nHarry listened attentively whilst I recounted all the events that I have narrated in these\npages.",
    "The thing that bewildered and astonished him most was to find that all along the\ndiamonds had been in my possession\u2014or rather in Suzanne\u2019s.",
    "That was a fact he had never\nsuspected.",
    "Of course after hearing his story I realized the point of Carton\u2019s little\narrangement\u2014or rather Nadina\u2019s since I had no doubt that it was her brain which had\nconceived the plan.",
    "No surprise tactics executed against her or her husband could result in\nthe seizure of the diamonds.",
    "The secret was locked in her own brain and the \u201cColonel\u201d was\nnot likely to guess that they had been entrusted to the keeping of an ocean steward\nHarry\u2019s vindication from the old charge of theft seemed assured.",
    "It was the other graver\ncharge that paralysed all our activities.",
    "For as things stood he could not come out in the\nopen to prove his case.",
    "The one thing we came back to again and again was the identity of the \u201cColonel.\u201d Was\nhe or was he not Guy Pagett\n\u201cI should say he was but for one thing\u201d said Harry.",
    "\u201cIt seems pretty much of a certainty\nthat it was Pagett who murdered Anita Gr\u00fcnberg at Marlow\u2014and that certainly lends colour\nto the supposition that he is actually the \u2018Colonel\u2019 since Anita\u2019s business was not of the\nnature to be discussed with a subordinate.",
    "No\u2014the only thing that militates against that\ntheory is the attempt to put you out of the way the night of your arrival here.",
    "You saw Pagett\nleft behind at Cape Town\u2014by no possible means could he have arrived here before the\nfollowing Wednesday.",
    "He is unlikely to have any emissaries in this part of the world and\nall his plans were laid to deal with you in Cape Town.",
    "He might of course have cabled\ninstructions to some lieutenant of his in Johannesburg who could have joined the Rhodesian\ntrain at Mafeking but his instructions would have had to be particularly definite to allow of\nthat note being written.\u201d\nWe sat silent for a moment then Harry went on slowly\n\u201cYou say that Mrs. Blair was asleep when you left the hotel and that you heard Sir\nEustace dictating to Miss Pettigrew Where was Colonel Race\u201d\n\u201cI could not find him anywhere.\u201d\n\u201cHad he any reason to believe that\u2014you and I might be friendly with each other\u201d\n\u201cHe might have had\u201d I answered thoughtfully remembering our conversation on the way\nback from the Matopos.",
    "\u201cHe\u2019s a very powerful personality\u201d I continued \u201cbut not at all my\nidea of the \u2018Colonel.\u2019 And anyway such an idea would be absurd.",
    "He\u2019s in the Secret\n\n\fService.\u201d\n\u201cHow do we know that he is It\u2019s the easiest thing in the world to throw out a hint of that\nkind.",
    "No one contradicts it and the rumour spreads until everyone believes it as gospel\ntruth.",
    "It provides an excuse for all sorts of doubtful doings.",
    "Anne do you like Race\u201d\n\u201cI do\u2014and I don\u2019t.",
    "He repels me and at the same time fascinates me but I know one\nthing I\u2019m always a little afraid of him.\u201d\n\u201cHe was in South Africa you know at the time of the Kimberley robbery\u201d said Harry\nslowly.",
    "\u201cBut it was he who told Suzanne all about the \u2018Colonel\u2019 and how he had been in Paris\ntrying to get on his track.\u201d\n\u201cCamouflage\u2014of a particularly clever kind.\u201d\n\u201cBut where does Pagett come in Is he in Race\u2019s pay\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps\u201d said Harry slowly \u201che doesn\u2019t come in at all.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u201d\n\u201cThink back Anne.",
    "Did you ever hear Pagett\u2019s own account of that night on the\nKilmorden\u201d\n\u201cYes\u2014through Sir Eustace.\u201d\nI repeated it.",
    "Harry listened closely.",
    "\u201cHe saw a man coming from the direction of Sir Eustace\u2019s cabin and followed him up on\ndeck.",
    "Is that what he says Now who had the cabin opposite to Sir Eustace Colonel Race.",
    "Supposing Colonel Race crept up on deck and foiled in his attack on you fled round the\ndeck and met Pagett just coming through the saloon door.",
    "He knocks him down and springs\ninside closing the door.",
    "We dash round and find Pagett lying there.",
    "How\u2019s that\u201d\n\u201cYou forget that he declares positively it was you who knocked him down.\u201d\n\u201cWell suppose that just as he regains consciousness he sees me disappearing in the\ndistance Wouldn\u2019t he take it for granted that I was his assailant Especially as he thought\nall along it was I he was following\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s possible yes\u201d I said slowly.",
    "\u201cBut it alters all our ideas.",
    "And there are other things.\u201d\n\u201cMost of them are open to explanation.",
    "The man who followed you in Cape Town spoke\nto Pagett and Pagett looked at his watch.",
    "The man might have merely asked him the time.\u201d\n\u201cIt was just a coincidence you mean\u201d\n\u201cNot exactly.",
    "There\u2019s a method in all this connecting Pagett with the affair.",
    "Why was the\nMill House chosen for the murder Was it because Pagett had been in Kimberley when the\n\n\fdiamonds were stolen Would he have been made the scapegoat if I had not appeared so\nprovidentially upon the scene\u201d\n\u201cThen you think he may be entirely innocent\u201d\n\u201cIt looks like it but if so we\u2019ve got to find out what he was doing in Marlow.",
    "If he\u2019s got\na reasonable explanation of that we\u2019re on the right track.\u201d\nHe got up.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s past midnight.",
    "Turn in Anne and get some sleep.",
    "Just before dawn I\u2019ll take you over\nin the boat.",

    "\u201cYes Anne it\u2019s Beira for you.",
    "This is man\u2019s work.",
    "Leave it to me.\u201d\nWe had had a momentary respite from emotion whilst we talked the situation out but it\nwas on us again now.",
    "We did not even look at each other.",
    "\u201cVery well\u201d I said and passed into the hut.",
    "I lay down on the skincovered couch but I didn\u2019t sleep and outside I could hear Harry\nRayburn pacing up and down up and down through the long dark hours.",
    "At last he called\nme\n\u201cCome Anne it\u2019s time to go.\u201d\nI got up and came out obediently.",

    "Presently I heard it too\u2014the faint splash of\npaddles in the water coming from the direction of the right bank of the river and rapidly\napproaching our little landing stage.",
    "We strained our eyes in the darkness and could make out a dark blur on the surface of the\nwater.",
    "It was a boat.",
    "Then there was a momentary spurt of flame.",
    "Someone had struck a\nmatch.",
    "By its light I recognized one figure the redbearded Dutchman of the villa at\nMuizenberg.",
    "The others were natives.",

    "One just grazed Harry\u2019s cheek.",

    "I had the rifle reloaded when he turned for it.",
    "He caught me close with his left arm\nand kissed me once savagely before he turned to the window again.",
    "Suddenly he uttered a\nshout.",
    "\u201cThey\u2019re going\u2014had enough of it.",
    "They\u2019re a good mark out there on the water and they\ncan\u2019t see how many of us there are.",
    "They\u2019re routed for the moment\u2014but they\u2019ll come back.",
    "We\u2019ll have to get ready for them.\u201d He flung down the rifle and turned to me.",

    "Come\nAnne we\u2019ve got to try desperate means.\u201d\nHand in hand we raced across the island.",
    "Only a narrow channel of water divided it\nfrom the shore on that side.",
    "\u201cWe\u2019ve got to swim for it.",
    "Can you swim at all Anne Not that it matters.",
    "I can get you\nacross.",
    "It\u2019s the wrong side for a boat\u2014too many rocks but the right side for swimming and\nthe right side for Livingstone.\u201d\n\u201cI can swim a little\u2014further than that.",

    "My prayers must have been efficacious for we reached the shore without\nadventure and drew ourselves up wet and dripping on the bank.",
    "\u201cNow for Livingstone.",
    "It\u2019s rough going I\u2019m afraid and wet clothes won\u2019t make it any\nbetter.",
    "But it\u2019s got to be done.\u201d\nThat walk was a nightmare.",

    "Harry\u2019s friend was a young man of twenty years old who kept a store of native curios.",
    "His\nname was Ned\u2014perhaps he had another but I never heard it.",
    "He didn\u2019t seem in the least\nsurprised to see Harry walk in dripping wet holding an equally dripping female by the\nhand.",
    "Men are very wonderful.",
    "He gave us food to eat and hot coffee and got our clothes dried for us whilst we rolled\nourselves in Manchester blankets of gaudy hue.",
    "In the tiny back room of the hut we were\nsafe from observation whilst he departed to make judicious inquiries as to what had become\n\n\fof Sir Eustace\u2019s party and whether any of them were still at the hotel.",
    "It was then that I informed Harry that nothing would induce me to go to Beira.",
    "I never\nmeant to anyway but now all reason for such proceedings had vanished.",
    "The point of the\nplan had been that my enemies believed me dead.",

    "\u201cAnd how are you Mr. Pagett\u201d\n\u201cVery well thank you\u2014looking forward to taking up my work again with Sir Eustace.\u201d\n\u201cMr.",
    "Pagett\u201d I said \u201cthere is something I want to ask you.",
    "I hope that you won\u2019t be\noffended but a lot hangs on it more than you can possibly guess.",
    "I want to know what you\nwere doing at Marlow on the 8th of January last\u201d\nHe started violently.",
    "\u201cReally Miss Beddingfeld\u2014I\u2014indeed\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou were there weren\u2019t you\u201d\n\u201cI\u2014for reasons of my own I was in the neighbourhood yes.\u201d\n\u201cWon\u2019t you tell me what those reasons were\u201d\n\u201cSir Eustace has not already told you\u201d\n\u201cSir Eustace Does he know\u201d\n\u201cI am almost sure that he does.",
    "I hoped he had not recognized me but from the hints he\n\n\fhas let drop and his remarks I fear it is only too certain.",
    "In any case I meant to make a\nclean breast of the matter and offer my resignation.",
    "He is a peculiar man Miss Beddingfeld\nwith an abnormal sense of humour.",
    "It seems to amuse him to keep me on tenterhooks.",
    "All the\ntime I dare say he was perfectly well aware of the true facts.",
    "Possibly he has known them\nfor years.\u201d\nI hoped that sooner or later I should be able to understand what Pagett was talking about.",
    "He went on fluently\n\u201cIt is difficult for a man of Sir Eustace\u2019s standing to put himself in my position.",
    "I know\nthat I was in the wrong but it seemed a harmless deception.",
    "I would have thought it better\ntaste on his part to have tackled me outright\u2014instead of indulging in covert jokes at my\nexpense.\u201d\nA whistle blew and the people began to surge back into the train.",
    "\u201cYes Mr. Pagett\u201d I broke in \u201cI\u2019m sure I quite agree with all you\u2019re saying about Sir\nEustace.",
    "But why did you go to Marlow\u201d\n\u201cIt was wrong of me but natural under the circumstances\u2014yes I still feel natural under\nthe circumstances.\u201d\n\u201cWhat circumstances\u201d I cried desperately.",
    "For the first time Pagett seemed to recognize that I was asking him a question.",
    "His mind\ndetached itself from the peculiarities of Sir Eustace and his own justification and came to\nrest on me.",
    "\u201cI beg your pardon Miss Beddingfeld\u201d he said stiffly \u201cbut I fail to see your concern in\nthe matter.\u201d\nHe was back in the train now leaning down to speak to me.",
    "I felt desperate.",
    "What could\none do with a man like that\n\u201cOf course if it\u2019s so dreadful that you\u2019d be ashamed to speak of it to me\u2014\u201d I began\nspitefully.",
    "At last I had found the right stop.",
    "Pagett stiffened and flushed.",
    "\u201cDreadful Ashamed I don\u2019t understand you.\u201d\n\u201cThen tell me.\u201d\nIn three short sentences he told me.",
    "At last I knew Pagett\u2019s secret It was not in the least\nwhat I expected.",
    "I walked slowly back to the hotel.",
    "There a wire was handed to me.",
    "I tore it open.",
    "It\ncontained full and definite instructions for me to proceed forthwith to Johannesburg or\nrather to a station this side of Johannesburg where I should be met by a car.",
    "It was signed\nnot Andy but Harry.",
    "I sat down in a chair to do some very serious thinking.",
    "Thirtyone\nFrom the diary of Sir Eustace Pedler\n\nJohannesburg March 7th.",
    "Pagett has arrived.",
    "He is in a blue funk of course.",
    "Suggested at once that we should go\noff to Pretoria.",
    "Then when I had told him kindly but firmly that we were going to remain\nhere he went to the other extreme wished he had his rifle here and began bucking about\nsome bridge he guarded during the Great War.",
    "A railway bridge at Little Puddecombe\njunction or something of that sort.",
    "I soon cut that short by telling him to unpack the big typewriter.",
    "I thought that that\nwould keep him employed for some time because the typewriter was sure to have gone\nwrong\u2014it always does\u2014and he would have to take it somewhere to be mended.",
    "But I had\nforgotten Pagett\u2019s powers of being in the right.",
    "\u201cI\u2019ve already unpacked all the cases Sir Eustace.",
    "The typewriter is in perfect\ncondition.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean\u2014all the cases\u201d\n\u201cThe two small cases as well.\u201d\n\u201cI wish you wouldn\u2019t be so officious Pagett.",
    "Those small cases were no business of\nyours.",
    "They belong to Mrs. Blair.\u201d\nPagett looked crestfallen.",
    "He hates to make a mistake.",
    "\u201cSo you can just pack them up again neatly\u201d I continued.",
    "\u201cAfter that you can go out\nand look around you.",
    "Jo\u2019burg will probably be a heap of smoking ruins by tomorrow so\nit may be your last chance.\u201d\nI thought that that would get rid of him successfully for the morning at any rate.",
    "\u201cThere is something I want to say to you when you have the leisure Sir Eustace.\u201d\n\u201cI haven\u2019t got it now\u201d I said hastily.",
    "\u201cAt this minute I have absolutely no leisure\nwhatsoever.\u201d\nPagett retired.",
    "\u201cBy the way\u201d I called after him \u201cwhat was there in those cases of Mrs. Blair\u2019s\u201d\n\u201cSome fur rugs and a couple of fur\u2014hats I think.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s right\u201d I assented.",
    "\u201cShe bought them on the train.",
    "They are hats\u2014of a kind\u2014\nthough I hardly wonder at your not recognizing them.",
    "I dare say she\u2019s going to wear one\n\n\fof them at Ascot.",
    "What else was there\u201d\n\u201cSome rolls of films and some baskets\u2014a lot of baskets\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThere would be\u201d I assured him.",
    "\u201cMrs.",
    "Blair is the kind of woman who never buys\nless than a dozen or so of anything.\u201d\n\u201cI think that\u2019s all Sir Eustace except some miscellaneous odds and ends a motor veil\nand some odd gloves\u2014that sort of thing.\u201d\n\u201cIf you hadn\u2019t been a born idiot Pagett you would have seen from the start that those\ncouldn\u2019t possibly be my belongings.\u201d\n\u201cI thought some of them might belong to Miss Pettigrew.\u201d\n\u201cAh that reminds me\u2014what do you mean by picking me out such a doubtful character\nas a secretary\u201d\nAnd I told him about the searching crossexamination I had been put through.",
    "Immediately I was sorry I saw a glint in his eye that I know only too well.",
    "I changed the\nconversation hurriedly.",
    "But it was too late.",
    "Pagett was on the warpath.",
    "He next proceeded to bore me with a long pointless story about the Kilmorden.",
    "It was\nabout a roll of films and a wager.",
    "The roll of films being thrown through a porthole in\nthe middle of the night by some steward who ought to have known better.",
    "I hate\nhorseplay.",
    "I told Pagett so and he began to tell me the story all over again.",
    "He tells a\nstory extremely badly anyway.",
    "It was a long time before I could make head or tail of this\none.",
    "I did not see him again until lunchtime.",
    "Then he came in brimming over with\nexcitement like a bloodhound on the scent.",
    "I never have cared for bloodhounds.",
    "The\nupshot of it all was that he had seen Rayburn.",
    "\u201cWhat\u201d I cried startled.",
    "Yes he had caught sight of someone whom he was sure was Rayburn crossing the\nstreet.",
    "Pagett had followed him.",
    "\u201cAnd who do you think I saw him stop and speak to Miss Pettigrew\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u201d\n\u201cYes Sir Eustace.",
    "And that\u2019s not all.",
    "I\u2019ve been making inquiries about her\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWait a bit.",
    "What happened to Rayburn\u201d\n\u201cHe and Miss Pettigrew went into that corner curioshop\u2014\u201d\nI uttered an involuntary exclamation.",
    "Pagett stopped inquiringly.",
    "\u201cNothing\u201d I said.",
    "\u201cGo on.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cI waited outside for ages\u2014but they didn\u2019t come out.",
    "At last I went in.",
    "Sir Eustace\nthere was no one in the shop There must be another way out.\u201d\nI stared at him.",
    "\u201cAs I was saying I came back to the hotel and made some inquiries about Miss\nPettigrew.\u201d Pagett lowered his voice and breathed hard as he always does when he\nwants to be confidential.",
    "\u201cSir Eustace a man was seen coming out of her room last\nnight.\u201d\nI raised my eyebrows.",
    "\u201cAnd I always regarded her as a lady of such eminent respectability\u201d I murmured.",
    "Pagett went on without heeding.",
    "\u201cI went straight up and searched her room.",
    "What do you think I found\u201d\nI shook my head.",
    "\u201cThis\u201d\nPagett held up a safety razor and a stick of shaving soap.",
    "\u201cWhat should a woman want with these\u201d\nI don\u2019t suppose Pagett ever reads the advertisements in the highclass ladies\u2019 papers.",
    "I do.",
    "Whilst not proposing to argue with him on the subject I refused to accept the\npresence of the razor as proof positive of Miss Pettigrew\u2019s sex.",
    "Pagett is so hopelessly\nbehind the times.",
    "I should not have been at all surprised if he had produced a cigarette\ncase to support his theory.",
    "However even Pagett has his limits.",
    "\u201cYou\u2019re not convinced Sir Eustace.",
    "What do you say to this\u201d\nI inspected the article which he dangled aloft triumphantly.",
    "\u201cIt looks like hair\u201d I remarked distastefully.",
    "\u201cIt is hair.",
    "I think it\u2019s what they call a toupee.\u201d\n\u201cIndeed\u201d I commented.",
    "\u201cNow are you convinced that that Pettigrew woman is a man in disguise\u201d\n\u201cReally my dear Pagett I think I am.",
    "I might have known it by her feet.\u201d\n\u201cThen that\u2019s that.",
    "And now Sir Eustace I want to speak to you about my private\naffairs.",
    "I cannot doubt from your hints and your continual allusions to the time I was in\nFlorence that you have found me out.\u201d\nAt last the mystery of what Pagett did in Florence is going to be revealed\n\u201cMake a clean breast of it my dear fellow\u201d I said kindly.",
    "\u201cMuch the best way.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cThank you Sir Eustace.\u201d\n\u201cIs it her husband Annoying fellows husbands.",
    "Always turning up when they\u2019re least\nexpected.\u201d\n\u201cI fail to follow you Sir Eustace.",
    "Whose husband\u201d\n\u201cThe lady\u2019s husband.\u201d\n\u201cWhat lady\u201d\n\u201cGod bless my soul Pagett the lady you met in Florence.",
    "There must have been a\nlady.",
    "Don\u2019t tell me that you merely robbed a church or stabbed an Italian in the back\nbecause you didn\u2019t like his face.\u201d\n\u201cI am quite at a loss to understand you Sir Eustace.",
    "I suppose you are joking.\u201d\n\u201cI am an amusing fellow sometimes when I take the trouble but I can assure you that\nI am not trying to be funny this minute.\u201d\n\u201cI hoped that as I was a good way off you had not recognized me Sir Eustace.\u201d\n\u201cRecognized you where\u201d\n\u201cAt Marlow Sir Eustace\u201d\n\u201cAt Marlow What the devil were you doing at Marlow\u201d\n\u201cI thought you understood that\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m beginning to understand less and less.",
    "Go back to the beginning of the story and\nstart again.",
    "You went to Florence\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThen you don\u2019t know after all\u2014and you didn\u2019t recognize me\u201d\n\u201cAs far as I can judge you seem to have given yourself away needlessly\u2014made a\ncoward of by your conscience.",
    "But I shall be able to tell better when I\u2019ve heard the whole\nstory.",
    "Now then take a deep breath and start again.",
    "You went to Florence\u2014\u201d\n\u201cBut I didn\u2019t go to Florence.",
    "That is just it.\u201d\n\u201cWell where did you go then\u201d\n\u201cI went home\u2014to Marlow.\u201d\n\u201cWhat the devil did you want to go to Marlow for\u201d\n\u201cI wanted to see my wife.",
    "She was in delicate health and expecting\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYour wife But I didn\u2019t know you were married\u201d\n\u201cNo Sir Eustace that is just what I am telling you.",
    "I deceived you in this matter.\u201d\n\u201cHow long have you been married\u201d\n\n\f\u201cJust over eight years.",
    "I had been married just six months when I became your\nsecretary.",
    "I did not want to lose the post.",
    "A resident secretary is not supposed to have a\nwife so I suppressed the fact.\u201d\n\u201cYou take my breath away\u201d I remarked.",
    "\u201cWhere has she been all these years\u201d\n\u201cWe have had a small bungalow on the river at Marlow quite close to the Mill House\nfor over five years.\u201d\n\u201cGod bless my soul\u201d I muttered.",
    "\u201cAny children\u201d\n\u201cFour children Sir Eustace.\u201d\nI gazed at him in a kind of stupor.",
    "I might have known all along that a man like\nPagett couldn\u2019t have a guilty secret.",
    "The respectability of Pagett has always been my\nbane.",
    "That\u2019s just the kind of secret he would have\u2014a wife and four children.",
    "\u201cHave you told this to anyone else\u201d I demanded at last when I had gazed at him in\nfascinated interest for quite a long while.",
    "\u201cOnly Miss Beddingfeld.",
    "She came to the station at Kimberley.\u201d\nI continued to stare at him.",
    "He fidgeted under my glance.",
    "\u201cI hope Sir Eustace that you are not seriously annoyed\u201d\n\u201cMy dear fellow\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t mind telling you here and now that you\u2019ve blinking\nwell torn it\u201d\nI went out seriously ruffled.",
    "As I passed the corner curioshop I was assailed by a\nsudden irresistible temptation and went in.",
    "The proprietor came forward obsequiously\nrubbing his hands.",
    "\u201cCan I show you something Furs curios\u201d\n\u201cI want something quite out of the ordinary\u201d I said.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s for a special occasion.",
    "Will\nyou show me what you\u2019ve got\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps you will come into my back room We have many specialities there.\u201d\nThat is where I made a mistake.",

    "She argued she pleaded she even wept before she would\nlet me carry out my plan.",
    "But in the end I got my own way.",
    "She promised to carry out my\ninstructions to the letter and came down to the station to bid me a tearful farewell.",
    "I arrived at my destination the following morning early.",
    "I was met by a short blackbearded Dutchman whom I had never seen before.",
    "He had a car waiting and we drove off.",
    "There was a queer booming in the distance and I asked him what it was.",
    "\u201cGuns\u201d he\nanswered laconically.",
    "So there was fighting going on in Jo\u2019burg\nI gathered that our objective was a spot somewhere in the suburbs of the city.",
    "We turned\nand twisted and made several detours to get there and every minute the guns were nearer.",
    "It\nwas an exciting time.",
    "At last we stopped before a somewhat ramshackle building.",
    "The door\nwas opened by a Kafir boy.",
    "My guide signed to me to enter.",
    "I stood irresolute in the dingy\nsquare hall.",
    "The man passed me and threw open a door.",

    "\u201cIs it Mr. Chichester or is it Miss Pettigrew\nThere is an extraordinary resemblance to both of them.\u201d\n\u201cBoth characters are in abeyance for the moment.",

    "\u201cIt would seem\u201d I remarked \u201cthat I have come to the wrong address.\u201d\n\u201cFrom your point of view I am afraid you have.",
    "Really Miss Beddingfeld to fall into the\ntrap a second time\u201d\n\u201cIt was not very bright of me\u201d I admitted meekly.",
    "Something about my manner seemed to puzzle him.",
    "\u201cYou hardly seem upset by the occurrence\u201d he remarked dryly.",
    "\u201cWould my going into heroics have any effect upon you\u201d I asked.",
    "\u201cIt certainly would not.\u201d\n\u201cMy Greataunt Jane always used to say that a true lady was neither shocked nor\nsurprised at anything that might happen\u201d I murmured dreamily.",
    "\u201cI endeavour to live up to\nher precepts.\u201d\nI read Mr. ChichesterPettigrew\u2019s opinion so plainly written on his face that I hastened\ninto speech once more.",
    "\u201cYou really are positively marvellous at makeup\u201d I said generously.",
    "\u201cAll the time you\nwere Miss Pettigrew I never recognized you\u2014even when you broke your pencil in the\nshock of seeing me climb upon the train at Cape Town.\u201d\nHe tapped upon the desk with the pencil he was holding in his hand at the minute.",
    "\u201cAll this is very well in its way but we must get to business.",
    "Perhaps Miss Beddingfeld\nyou can guess why we required your presence here\u201d\n\u201cYou will excuse me\u201d I said \u201cbut I never do business with anyone but principals.\u201d\nI had read the phrase or something like it in a moneylender\u2019s circular and I was rather\npleased with it.",

    "I interrupted him.",
    "\u201cI can assure you it\u2019s no good shouting at me.",
    "We are only wasting time here.",

    "\u201cSir Eustace Pedler.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2014I\u2014excuse me\u2014\u201d\nHe bolted from the room like a rabbit.",
    "I took advantage of the respite to open my bag and\npowder my nose thoroughly.",
    "Also I settled my hat at a more becoming angle.",

    "He reappeared in a subtly chastened mood.",

    "How long have you\nknown that I was the \u2018Colonel\u2019 \u201d\n\u201cEver since Mr. Pagett told me that he had seen you in Marlow when you were supposed\nto be in Cannes.\u201d\nSir Eustace nodded ruefully.",
    "\u201cYes I told the fool he\u2019d blinking well torn it.",
    "He didn\u2019t understand of course.",
    "His\nwhole mind was set on whether I\u2019d recognized him.",
    "It never occurred to him to wonder\nwhat I was doing down there.",
    "A piece of sheer bad luck that was.",
    "I arranged it all so\ncarefully too sending him off to Florence telling the hotel I was going over to Nice for one\nnight or possibly two.",
    "Then by the time the murder was discovered I was back again in\nCannes with nobody dreaming that I\u2019d ever left the Riviera.\u201d\nHe still spoke quite naturally and unaffectedly.",

    "She met Pagett in the doorway of the Trade Commissioner\u2019s\noffice or the Chamber of Mines or wherever it was he went\u2014told him I had phoned down\nin a hurry and that she had been selected by the Government department in question.",

    "I could not even feel frightened of him\u2014and yet I\nknew he was capable of having me murdered in cold blood if it struck him as necessary.",

    "But no romancing mind\u2014I want the truth.\u201d\nI was not going to make any mistake over that.",

    "You\u2019re the kind of girl who would start off like that\n\u2014at a moment\u2019s notice on the slenderest of motives.",
    "You\u2019ve had amazing luck of course\nbut sooner or later the amateur runs up against the professional and then the result is a\nforegone conclusion.",

    "Of course if\nyou\u2019re in an heroic mood and prefer annihilation that\u2019s another matter.\u201d\n\n\fThis was what I had been playing for.",
    "I was careful not to jump at the bait.",

    "Be sure and bring the diamonds\nwith you.",
    "Not a word to anyone.\u201d\nSir Eustace stopped.",

    "\u201cBut be careful to\nmake no mistakes.\u201d\n\u201c \u2018Yours for ever and ever Anne\u2019 will be sufficient\u201d I remarked.",
    "I wrote in the words.",
    "Sir Eustace stretched out his hand for the letter and read it through.",
    "\u201cThat seems all right.",
    "Now the address.\u201d\nI gave it him.",
    "It was that of a small shop which received letters and telegrams for a\nconsideration.",
    "He struck the bell upon the table with his hand.",
    "ChichesterPettigrew alias Minks\nanswered the summons.",
    "\u201cThis letter is to go immediately\u2014the usual route.\u201d\n\u201cVery well Colonel.\u201d\nHe looked at the name on the envelope.",

    "I\ngave him misleading information.\u201d\n\u201cExcellent my dear fellow excellent\u201d said Sir Eustace genially.",
    "\u201cMy mistake.\u201d\nI chanced to look at ChichesterPettigrew as he left the room.",
    "He was white to the lips as\nthough in deadly terror.",
    "No sooner was he outside than Sir Eustace picked up a speaking\ntube that rested by his elbow and spoke down it.",
    "\u201cThat you Schwart Watch Minks.",
    "He\u2019s\nnot to leave the house without orders.\u201d\nHe put the speaking tube down again and frowned slightly tapping the table with his\n\n\fhand.",
    "\u201cMay I ask you a few questions Sir Eustace\u201d I said after a minute or two of silence.",
    "\u201cCertainly.",
    "What excellent nerves you have Anne You are capable of taking an\nintelligent interest in things when most girls would be sniffling and wringing their hands.\u201d\n\u201cWhy did you take Harry as your secretary instead of giving him up to the police\u201d\n\u201cI wanted those cursed diamonds.",
    "Nadina the little devil was playing off your Harry\nagainst me.",
    "Unless I gave her the price she wanted she threatened to sell them back to him.",
    "That was another mistake I made\u2014I thought she\u2019d have them with her that day.",
    "But she was\ntoo clever for that.",
    "Carton her husband was dead too\u2014I\u2019d no clue whatsoever as to where\nthe diamonds were hidden.",
    "Then I managed to get a copy of a wireless message sent to\nNadina by someone on board the Kilmorden\u2014either Carton or Rayburn I didn\u2019t know\nwhich.",
    "It was a duplicate of that piece of paper you picked up.",
    "\u2018Seventeen one twenty two\u2019\nit ran.",
    "I took it to be an appointment with Rayburn and when he was so desperate to get\naboard the Kilmorden I was convinced that I was right.",
    "So I pretended to swallow his\nstatements and let him come.",
    "I kept a pretty sharp watch upon him and hoped that I should\nlearn more.",
    "Then I found Minks trying to play a lone hand and interfering with me.",
    "I soon\nstopped that.",
    "He came to heel all right.",
    "It was annoying not getting Cabin 17 and it worried\nme not being able to place you.",
    "Were you the innocent young girl you seemed or were you\nnot When Rayburn set out to keep the appointment that night Minks was told off to\nintercept him.",
    "Minks muffed it of course.\u201d\n\u201cBut why did the wireless message say \u2018seventeen\u2019 instead of \u2018seventyone\u2019 \u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve thought that out.",
    "Carton must have given that wireless operator his own\nmemorandum to copy off on to a form and he never read the copy through.",
    "The operator\nmade the same mistake we all did and read it as 17.1.22 instead of 1.71.22.",
    "The thing I\ndon\u2019t know is how Minks got on to Cabin 17.",
    "It must have been sheer instinct.\u201d\n\u201cAnd the dispatch to General Smuts Who tampered with that\u201d\n\u201cMy dear Anne you don\u2019t suppose I was going to have a lot of my plans given away\nwithout making an effort to save them With an escaped murderer as a secretary I had no\nhesitation whatever in substituting blanks.",
    "Nobody would think of suspecting poor old\nPedler.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about Colonel Race\u201d\n\u201cYes that was a nasty jar.",
    "When Pagett told me he was a Secret Service fellow I had an\nunpleasant feeling down the spine.",
    "I remembered that he\u2019d been nosing around Nadina in\nParis during the War\u2014and I had a horrible suspicion that he was out after me I don\u2019t like\nthe way he\u2019s stuck to me ever since.",
    "He\u2019s one of those strong silent men who have always\ngot something up their sleeve.\u201d\n\n\fA whistle sounded.",
    "Sir Eustace picked up the tube listened for a minute or two then\nanswered\n\u201cVery well I\u2019ll see him now.\u201d\n\u201cBusiness\u201d he remarked.",
    "\u201cMiss Anne let me show you your room.\u201d\nHe ushered me into a small shabby apartment a Kafir boy brought up my small suitcase\nand Sir Eustace urging me to ask for anything I wanted withdrew the picture of a courteous\nhost.",
    "A can of hot water was on the washstand and I proceeded to unpack a few\nnecessaries.",
    "Something hard and unfamiliar in my spongebag puzzled me greatly.",
    "I untied the\nstring and looked inside.",
    "To my utter amazement I drew out a small pearlhandled revolver.",
    "It hadn\u2019t been there\nwhen I started from Kimberley.",
    "I examined the thing gingerly.",
    "It appeared to be loaded.",
    "I handled it with a comfortable feeling.",
    "It was a useful thing to have in a house such as\nthis.",
    "But modern clothes are quite unsuited to the carrying of firearms.",
    "In the end I pushed it\ngingerly into the top of my stocking.",
    "It made a terrible bulge and I expected every minute\nthat it would go off and shoot me in the leg but it really seemed the only place.",
    "Thirtythree\n\nI was not summoned to Sir Eustace\u2019s presence until late in the afternoon.",
    "Eleveno\u2019clock\ntea and a substantial lunch had been served to me in my own apartment and I felt fortified\nfor further conflict.",
    "Sir Eustace was alone.",
    "He was walking up and down the room there was a gleam in his\neye and a restlessness in his manner which did not escape me.",
    "He was exultant about\nsomething.",
    "There was a subtle change in his manner towards me.",
    "\u201cI have news for you.",
    "Your young man is on his way.",
    "He will be here in a few minutes.",
    "Moderate your transports\u2014I have something more to say.",
    "You attempted to deceive me this\nmorning.",
    "I warned you that you would be wise to stick to the truth and up to a certain point\nyou obeyed me.",
    "Then you ran off the rails.",
    "You attempted to make me believe that the\ndiamonds were in Harry Rayburn\u2019s possession.",
    "At the time I accepted your statement\nbecause it facilitated my task\u2014the task of inducing you to decoy Harry Rayburn here.",
    "But\nmy dear Anne the diamonds have been in my possession ever since I left the Falls\u2014though\nI only discovered the fact yesterday.\u201d\n\u201cYou know\u201d I gasped.",
    "\u201cIt may interest you to hear that it was Pagett who gave the show away.",
    "He insisted on\nboring me with a long pointless story about a wager and a tin of films.",
    "It didn\u2019t take me long\nto put two and two together\u2014Mrs.",

    "The excellent Pagett had already\nunfastened the cases through an excess of zeal.",
    "Before leaving the hotel I simply transferred\nall the rolls of films to my own pocket.",
    "They are in the corner there.",
    "I admit that I haven\u2019t\nhad time to examine them yet but I notice that one is of a totally different weight to the\nothers rattles in a peculiar fashion and has evidently been stuck down with seccotine\nwhich will necessitate the use of a tin opener.",
    "The case seems clear does it not And now\nyou see I have you both nicely in the trap .",
    ". . It\u2019s a pity that you didn\u2019t take kindly to the\nidea of becoming Lady Pedler.\u201d\nI did not answer.",
    "I stood looking at him.",
    "There was the sound of feet on the stairs the door was flung open and Harry Rayburn\nwas hustled into the room between two men.",
    "Sir Eustace flung me a look of triumph.",
    "\u201cAccording to plan\u201d he said softly.",
    "\u201cYou amateurs will pit yourselves against\nprofessionals.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the meaning of this\u201d cried Harry hoarsely.",
    "\u201cIt means that you have walked into my parlour\u2014said the spider to the fly\u201d remarked Sir\nEustace facetiously.",
    "\u201cMy dear Rayburn you are extraordinarily unlucky.\u201d\n\u201cYou said I could come safely Anne.\u201d\n\u201cDo not reproach her my dear fellow.",

    "Well my young\nfriend as you say now we can talk.",
    "I\u2019m willing to admit that you stole a march upon me.",

    "You didn\u2019t know did you Sir Eustace that Anne had an\narrangement with me by which we should know whether communications from one to the\nother were genuine Telegrams were to be signed \u2018Andy\u2019 letters were to have the word\n\u2018and\u2019 crossed out somewhere in them.",
    "Anne knew that your telegram was a fake.",
    "She came\nhere of her own free will walked deliberately into the snare in the hope that she might\ncatch you in your own trap.",
    "Before leaving Kimberley she wired both to me and to Race.",
    "Mrs. Blair has been in communication with us ever since.",
    "I received the letter written at\nyour dictation which was just what I expected.",
    "I had already discussed the probabilities of\na secret passage leading out of the curioshop with Race and he had discovered the place\nwhere the exit was situated.\u201d\nThere was a screaming tearing sound and a heavy explosion which shook the room.",

    "I must get you out of here Anne.\u201d\nA bright light flared up.",
    "The house opposite was on fire.",

    "Harry kept him covered with the revolver.",
    "\u201cSo you see Sir Eustace the game is up.",
    "It was you yourself who very kindly provided\nus with the clue of your whereabouts.",
    "Race\u2019s men were watching the exit of the secret\npassage.",
    "In spite of the precautions you took they were successful in following me here.\u201d\n\n\fSir Eustace turned suddenly.",
    "\u201cVery clever.",
    "Very creditable.",
    "But I\u2019ve still a word to say.",
    "If I\u2019ve lost the trick so have\nyou.",
    "You\u2019ll never be able to bring the murder of Nadina home to me.",
    "I was in Marlow on\nthat day that\u2019s all you\u2019ve got against me.",
    "No one can prove that I even knew the woman.",
    "But\nyou knew her you had a motive for killing her\u2014and your record\u2019s against you.",
    "You\u2019re a\nthief remember a thief.",

    "There was\na tinkle of breaking glass as the object went through the window and disappeared into the\nblazing mass opposite.",

    "A couple of minutes\u2019 start\nand I shall be all right.",
    "I\u2019ve got one or two little arrangements all ready made.",
    "You let me\nout of the way and give me a start\u2014and I leave you a signed confession that I killed\nNadina.\u201d\n\u201cYes Harry\u201d I cried.",
    "\u201cYes yes yes\u201d\nHe turned a stern face on me.",
    "\u201cNo Anne a thousand times no.",

    "It\u2019s no good Anne.",
    "I won\u2019t do it.\u201d\nSir Eustace chuckled.",

    "\u201cWell well\u201d he remarked.",
    "\u201cYou seem to have met your master Anne.",
    "But I can assure\nyou both that moral rectitude does not always pay.\u201d\nThere was a crash of rending wood and footsteps surged up the stairs.",

    "It means that when your tool Madame Nadina turned\n\n\fagainst you you planned to do away with her\u2014and at last we shall be able to bring the\ncrime home to you.\u201d\n\u201cIndeed And from whom did you get all this interesting information From the man who\nis even now being looked for by the police His evidence will be very valuable.\u201d\n\u201cWe have other evidence.",
    "There is someone else who knew that Nadina was going to\nmeet you at the Mill House.\u201d\nSir Eustace looked surprised.",
    "Colonel Race made a gesture with his hand.",
    "Arthur Minks\nalias the Rev.",

    "In\nJohannesburg Mr. Rayburn accosted me.",
    "He persuaded me to come over to his side.\u201d\nSir Eustace looked at him.",
    "He said nothing but Minks seemed visibly to wilt.",
    "\u201cRats always leave a sinking ship\u201d observed Sir Eustace.",
    "\u201cI don\u2019t care for rats.",
    "Sooner\nor later I destroy vermin.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s just one thing I\u2019d like to tell you Sir Eustace\u201d I remarked.",
    "\u201cThat tin you threw\nout of the window didn\u2019t contain the diamonds.",
    "It had common pebbles in it.",
    "The diamonds\nare in a perfectly safe place.",
    "As a matter of fact they\u2019re in the big giraffe\u2019s stomach.",
    "Suzanne\nhollowed it out put the diamonds in with cotton wool so that they wouldn\u2019t rattle and\nplugged it up again.\u201d\nSir Eustace looked at me for some time.",
    "His reply was characteristic\n\u201cI always did hate that blinking giraffe\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cIt must have been instinct.\u201d\n\n\fThirtyfour\n\nWe were not able to return to Johannesburg that night.",
    "The shells were coming over pretty\nfast and I gathered that we were now more or less cut off owing to the rebels having\nobtained possession of a new part of the suburbs.",
    "Our place of refuge was a farm some twenty miles or so from Johannesburg\u2014right out on\nthe veld.",
    "I was dropping with fatigue.",
    "All the excitement and anxiety of the last two days\nhad left me little better than a limp rag.",
    "I kept repeating to myself without being able to believe it that our troubles were really\nover.",
    "Harry and I were together and we should never be separated again.",
    "Yet all through I\nwas conscious of some barrier between us\u2014a constraint on his part the reason of which I\ncould not fathom.",
    "Sir Eustace had been driven off in an opposite direction accompanied by a strong guard.",
    "He waved his hand airily to us on departing.",
    "I came out on to the stoep early on the following morning and looked across the veld in\nthe direction of Johannesburg.",
    "I could see the great dumps glistening in the pale morning\nsunshine and I could hear the low rumbling mutter of the guns.",
    "The Revolution was not over\nyet.",
    "The farmer\u2019s wife came out and called me in to breakfast.",
    "She was a kind motherly soul\nand I was already very fond of her.",
    "Harry had gone out at dawn and had not yet returned so\nshe informed me.",
    "Again I felt a stir of uneasiness pass over me.",
    "What was this shadow of\nwhich I was so conscious between us\nAfter breakfast I sat out on the stoep a book in my hand which I did not read.",
    "I was so\nlost in my own thoughts that I never saw Colonel Race ride up and dismount from his horse.",
    "It was not until he said \u201cGood morning Anne\u201d that I became aware of his presence.",
    "\u201cOh\u201d I said with a flush \u201cit\u2019s you.\u201d\n\u201cYes.",
    "May I sit down\u201d\nHe drew a chair up beside me.",
    "It was the first time we had been alone together since that\nday at the Matopos.",
    "As always I felt that curious mixture of fascination and fear that he\nnever failed to inspire in me.",
    "\u201cWhat is the news\u201d I asked.",
    "\u201cSmuts will be in Johannesburg tomorrow.",
    "I give this outbreak three days more before it\ncollapses utterly.",
    "In the meantime the fighting goes on.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cI wish\u201d I said \u201cthat one could be sure that the right people were the ones to get killed.",
    "I\nmean the ones who wanted to fight\u2014not just all the poor people who happen to live in the\nparts where the fighting is going on.\u201d\nHe nodded.",
    "\u201cI know what you mean Anne.",
    "That\u2019s the unfairness of war.",
    "But I\u2019ve other news for you.\u201d\n\u201cYes\u201d\n\u201cA confession of incompetency on my part.",
    "Pedler has managed to escape.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u201d\n\u201cYes.",
    "No one knows how he managed it.",
    "He was securely locked up for the night\u2014in an\nupperstory room of one of the farms roundabouts which the Military have taken over but\nthis morning the room was empty and the bird had flown.\u201d\nSecretly I was rather pleased.",
    "Never to this day have I been able to rid myself of a\nsneaking fondness for Sir Eustace.",
    "I daresay it\u2019s reprehensible but there it is.",
    "I admired\nhim.",
    "He was a thoroughgoing villain I daresay\u2014but he was a pleasant one.",
    "I\u2019ve never met\nanyone half so amusing since.",
    "I concealed my feelings of course.",
    "Naturally Colonel Race would feel quite differently\nabout it.",
    "He wanted Sir Eustace brought to justice.",
    "There was nothing very surprising in his\nescape when one came to think of it.",
    "All round Jo\u2019burg he must have innumerable spies and\nagents.",
    "And whatever Colonel Race might think I was exceedingly doubtful that they would\never catch him.",
    "He probably had a wellplanned line of retreat.",
    "Indeed he had said as much\nto us.",
    "I expressed myself suitably though in a rather lukewarm manner and the conversation\nlanguished.",
    "Then Colonel Race asked suddenly for Harry.",
    "I told him that he had gone off at\ndawn and that I hadn\u2019t seen him this morning.",
    "\u201cYou understand don\u2019t you Anne that apart from formalities he is completely cleared\nThere are technicalities of course but Sir Eustace\u2019s guilt is wellassured.",
    "There is nothing\nnow to keep you apart.\u201d\nHe said this without looking at me in a slow jerky voice.",
    "\u201cI understand\u201d I said gratefully.",
    "\u201cAnd there is no reason why he should not at once resume his real name.\u201d\n\u201cNo of course not.\u201d\n\u201cYou know his real name\u201d\nThe question surprised me.",
    "\u201cOf course I do.",
    "Harry Lucas.\u201d\n\n\fHe did not answer and something in the quality of his silence struck me as peculiar.",
    "\u201cAnne do you remember that as we drove home from the Matopos that day I told you\nthat I knew what I had to do\u201d\n\u201cOf course I remember.\u201d\n\u201cI think that I may fairly say I have done it.",
    "The man you love is cleared of suspicion.\u201d\n\u201cWas that what you meant\u201d\n\u201cOf course.\u201d\nI hung my head ashamed of the baseless suspicion I had entertained.",
    "He spoke again in a\nthoughtful voice\n\u201cWhen I was a mere youngster I was in love with a girl who jilted me.",
    "After that I\nthought only of my work.",
    "My career meant everything to me.",
    "Then I met you Anne\u2014and all\nthat seemed worth nothing.",
    "But youth calls to youth .",
    ". . I\u2019ve still got my work.\u201d\nI was silent.",
    "I suppose one can\u2019t really love two men at once\u2014but you can feel like it.",
    "The magnetism of this man was very great.",
    "I looked up at him suddenly.",
    "\u201cI think that you\u2019ll go very far\u201d I said dreamily.",
    "\u201cI think that you\u2019ve got a great career\nahead of you.",
    "You\u2019ll be one of the world\u2019s big men.\u201d\nI felt as though I was uttering a prophecy.",
    "\u201cI shall be alone though.\u201d\n\u201cAll the people who do really big things are.\u201d\n\u201cYou think so\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure of it.\u201d\nHe took my hand and said in a low voice\n\u201cI\u2019d rather have had\u2014the other.\u201d\nThen Harry came striding round the corner of the house.",
    "Colonel Race rose.",
    "\u201cGood morning\u2014Lucas\u201d he said.",
    "For some reason Harry flushed up to the roots of his hair.",
    "\u201cYes\u201d I said gaily \u201cyou must be known by your real name now.\u201d\nBut Harry was still staring at Colonel Race.",
    "\u201cSo you know sir\u201d he said at last.",
    "\u201cI never forget a face.",
    "I saw you once as a boy.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s all this about\u201d I asked puzzled looking from one to the other.",
    "It seemed a conflict of wills between them.",
    "Race won.",
    "Harry turned slightly away.",
    "\u201cI suppose you\u2019re right sir.",
    "Tell her my real name.\u201d\n\u201cAnne this isn\u2019t Harry Lucas.",
    "Harry Lucas was killed in the War.",
    "This is John Harold\nEardsley.\u201d\n\n\fThirtyfive\n\nWith his last words Colonel Race had swung away and left us.",
    "I stood staring after him.",
    "Harry\u2019s voice recalled me to myself.",
    "\u201cAnne forgive me say you forgive me.\u201d\nHe took my hand in his and almost mechanically I drew it away.",
    "\u201cWhy did you deceive me\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know that I can make you understand.",
    "I was afraid of all that sort of thing\u2014the\npower and fascination of wealth.",
    "I wanted you to care for me just for myself\u2014for the man I\nwas\u2014without ornaments and trappings.\u201d\n\u201cYou mean you didn\u2019t trust me\u201d\n\u201cYou can put it that way if you like but it isn\u2019t quite true.",
    "I\u2019d become embittered\nsuspicious\u2014always prone to look for ulterior motives\u2014and it was so wonderful to be\ncared for in the way you cared for me.\u201d\n\u201cI see\u201d I said slowly.",
    "I was going over in my own mind the story he had told me.",
    "For the\nfirst time I noted discrepancies in it which I had disregarded\u2014an assurance of money the\npower to buy back the diamonds of Nadina the way in which he had preferred to speak of\nboth men from the point of view of an outsider.",
    "And when he had said \u201cmy friend\u201d he had\nmeant not Eardsley but Lucas.",
    "It was Lucas the quiet fellow who had loved Nadina so\ndeeply.",
    "\u201cHow did it come about\u201d I asked.",
    "\u201cWe were both reckless\u2014anxious to get killed.",
    "One night we exchanged identification\ndiscs\u2014for luck Lucas was killed the next day\u2014blown to pieces.\u201d\nI shuddered.",
    "\u201cBut why didn\u2019t you tell me now This morning You couldn\u2019t have doubted my caring\nfor you by this time\u201d\n\u201cAnne I didn\u2019t want to spoil it all.",

    "He was right.",
    "I owed you the truth.\u201d\nHe paused then said suddenly\n\u201cYou know Anne I\u2019m jealous of Race.",

    "There we made our plans.",

    "It was the night before we were to sail.",
    "I couldn\u2019t sleep.",
    "I was miserable and I didn\u2019t\nknow why.",
    "I hated leaving Africa.",
    "When I came back to it would it be the same thing\nWould it ever be the same thing again\nAnd then I was startled by an authoritative rap on the shutter.",
    "I sprang up.",
    "Harry was on\nthe stoep outside.",
    "\u201cPut some clothes on Anne and come out.",
    "I want to speak to you.\u201d\n\n\fI huddled on a few garments and stepped out into the cool night air\u2014still and scented\nwith its velvety feel.",

    "\u201cDamn your French frocks.",
    "Do you think I want to put frocks on you I\u2019m a damned sight\nmore likely to want to tear them off you.",
