    "Agatha Christie\nSPARKLING CYANIDE 1945\n\nSix people were thinking of Rosemary Barton who had died nearly a year ago...\n\nBook I  ROSEMARY\nWhat can I do to drive away remembrances from mine eyes\n\nChapter 1\nIRIS MARLE\nIris Marle was thinking about her sister Rosemary.",
    "For nearly a year she had deliberately tried to put the thought of Rosemary away from her.",
    "She hadnt wanted to remember.",
    "The blue cyanosed face the convulsed clutching fingers...",
    "The contrast between that and the gay lovely Rosemary of the day before... Well perhaps\nnot exactly gay.",
    "She had had flu  she had been depressed run down... All that had been\nbrought out at the inquest.",
    "Iris herself had laid stress on it.",
    "It accounted didnt it for\nRosemarys suicide\nOnce the inquest was over Iris had deliberately tried to put the whole thing out of her\nmind.",
    "Of what good was remembrance Forget it all Forget the whole horrible business.",
    "But now she realised she had got to remember.",
    "She had got to think back into the past...\nTo remember carefully every slight unimportant seeming incident...\nThat extraordinary interview with George last night necessitated remembrance.",
    "It had\nbeen so unexpected so frightening.",
    "Wait  Had it been so unexpected Hadnt there been\nindications beforehand Georges growing absorption his absentmindedness his\nunaccountable actions  his  well queerness was the only word for it All leading up to that\nmoment last night when he had called her into the study and taken the letters from the\ndrawer of the desk.",
    "So now there was no help for it.",
    "She had got to think about Rosemary  to remember.",
    "Rosemary  her sister...\nWith a shock Iris realised suddenly that it was the first time in her life she had ever thought\nabout Rosemary.",
    "Thought about her that is objectively as a person.",
    "She had always accepted Rosemary without thinking about her.",
    "You didnt think about\nyour mother or your father or your sister or your aunt.",
    "They just existed unquestioned in\nthose relationships.",
    "You didnt think about them as people.",
    "You didnt ask yourself even\nwhat they were like.",
    "What had Rosemary been like That might be very important now.",
    "A lot might depend\nupon it.",
    "Iris cast her mind back.",
    "Herself and Rosemary as children... Rosemary had been\nthe elder by six years.",
    "Glimpses of the past came back  brief flashes  short scenes.",
    "Herself as a small child eating\nbread and milk and Rosemary important in pig tails doing lessons at a table.",
    "The seaside one summer  Iris envying Rosemary who was a big girl and could swim\nRosemary going to boarding school  coming home for the holidays.",
    "Then she herself at\nschool and Rosemary being finished in Paris.",
    "Schoolgirl Rosemary clumsy all arms\nand legs.",
    "Finished Rosemary coming back from Paris with a strange new frightening\nelegance soft voiced graceful with a swaying undulating figure with red gold chestnut\nhair and big black fringed dark blue eyes.",
    "A disturbing beautiful creature  grown up  in a\ndifferent world\nFrom then on they had seen very little of each other the sixyear gap had been at its widest.",
    "Iris had been still at school.",
    "Rosemary in the full swing of a season.",
    "Even when Iris came\nhome the gap remained.",
    "Rosemarys life was one of late mornings in bed fork luncheons\nwith other debutantes dances most evenings of the week.",
    "Iris had been in the schoolroom\nwith Mademoiselle had gone for walks in the Park had had supper at nine oclock and\ngone to bed at ten.",
    "The intercourse between the sisters had been limited to such brief\ninterchanges as\nHello Iris telephone for a taxi for me theres a lamb Im going to be devastatingly late\nor I dont like that new frock Rosemary.",
    "It doesnt suit you.",
    "Its all bunch and fuss.",
    "Then had come Rosemarys engagement to George Barton.",
    "Excitement shopping streams\nof parcels bridesmaids dresses.",
    "The wedding.",
    "Walking up the aisles behind Rosemary\nhearing whispers\nWhat a beautiful bride she makes...\nWhy had Rosemary married George Even at the time Iris had been vaguely surprised.",
    "There had been so many exciting young men ringing Rosemary up taking her out.",
    "Why\nchoose George fifteen years older than herself kindly pleasant but definitely dull\nGeorge was well off but it wasnt money.",
    "Rosemary had her own money a great deal of it.",
    "Uncle Pauls money...\nIris searched her mind carefully seeking to differentiate between what she knew now and\nwhat she had known then Uncle Paul for instance\nHe wasnt really an uncle she had always known that.",
    "Without ever having been definitely\ntold them she knew certain facts.",
    "Paul Bennett had been in love with their mother.",
    "She had\npreferred another and a poorer man.",
    "Paul Bennett had taken his defeat in a romantic\nspirit.",
    "He had remained the family friend adopted an attitude of romantic platonic\ndevotion.",
    "He had become Uncle Paul had stood godfather to the firstborn child\nRosemary.",
    "When he died it was found that he had left his entire fortune to his little\ngoddaughter then a child of thirteen.",
    "Rosemary besides her beauty had been an heiress.",
    "And she had married nice dull George Barton.",
    "Why Iris had wondered then.",
    "She wondered now.",
    "Iris didnt believe that Rosemary had\never been in love with him.",
    "But she had seemed very happy with him and she had been fond of him  yes definitely\nfond of him.",
    "Iris had good opportunities for knowing for a year after the marriage their\nmother lovely delicate Viola Marle had died and Iris a girl of seventeen had gone to live\nwith Rosemary Barton and her husband.",
    "A girl of seventeen.",
    "Iris pondered over the picture of herself.",
    "What had she been like\nWhat had she felt thought seen\nShe came to the conclusion that that young Iris Marle had been slow of development \n\n\funthinking acquiescing in things as they were.",
    "Had she resented for instance her mothers\nearlier absorption in Rosemary On the whole she thought not.",
    "She had accepted\nunhesitatingly the fact that Rosemary was the very important one.",
    "Rosemary was out naturally her mother was occupied as far as her health permitted with her elder daughter.",
    "That had been natural enough.",
    "Her own turn would come some day.",
    "Viola Marle had\nalways been a somewhat remote mother preoccupied mainly with her own health\nrelegating her children to nurses governesses schools but invariably charming to them in\nthose brief moments when she came across them.",
    "Hector Marle had died when Iris was five\nyears old.",
    "The knowledge that he drank more than was good for him had permeated so\nsubtly that she had not the least idea how it had actually come to her.",
    "Seventeenyearold Iris Marle had accepted life as it came had duly mourned for her\nmother had worn black clothes had gone to live with her sister and her sisters husband at\ntheir house in Elvaston Square.",
    "Sometimes it had been rather dull in that house.",
    "Iris wasnt to come out officially until the\nfollowing year.",
    "In the meantime she took French and German lessons three times a week\nand also attended domestic science classes.",
    "There were times when she had nothing much\nto do and nobody to talk to.",
    "George was kind invariably affectionate and brotherly.",
    "His attitude had never varied.",
    "He\nwas the same now.",
    "And Rosemary Iris had seen very little of Rosemary.",
    "Rosemary had been out a good deal.",
    "Dressmakers cocktail parties bridge...\nWhat did she really know about Rosemary when she came to think of it Of her tastes of\nher hopes of her fears Frightening really how little you might know of a person after\nliving in the same house with them There had been little intimacy between the sisters.",
    "But shed got to think now.",
    "Shed got to remember.",
    "It might be important.",
    "Certainly Rosemary had seemed happy enough...\nUntil that day  a week before it happened.",
    "She Iris would never forget that day.",
    "It stood\nout crystal clear  each detail each word.",
    "The shining mahogany table the pushed back\nchair the hurried characteristic writing...\nIris closed her eyes and let the scene come back...",
    "Her own entry into Rosemarys sittingroom her sudden stop.",
    "It had startled her so what she saw Rosemary sitting at the writing table her head laid\ndown on her outstretched arms.",
    "Rosemary weeping with a deep abandoned sobbing.",
    "Shed\nnever seen Rosemary cry before  and this bitter violent weeping frightened her.",
    "True Rosemary had had a bad go of flu.",
    "Shed only been up a day or two.",
    "And everyone\nknew that flu did leave you depressed.",
    "Still Iris had cried out her voice childish startled\nOh Rosemary what is it\nRosemary sat up swept the hair back from her disfigured face.",
    "She struggled very hard to\nregain command of herself.",
    "She said quickly\nIts nothing  nothing  dont stare at me like that\nShe got up and passing her sister she ran out of the room.",
    "Puzzled upset Iris went farther into the room.",
    "Her eyes drawn wonderingly to the writing\ntable caught sight of her own name in her sisters handwriting.",
    "Had Rosemary been\nwriting to her then\nShe drew nearer looked down on the sheet of blue notepaper with the big characteristic\n\n\fsprawling writing even more sprawling than usual owing to the haste and agitation behind\nthe hand that held the pen.",
    "Darling Iris\nThere isnt any point in my making a will because my money goes to you anyway but Id\nlike certain of my things to be given to certain people.",
    "To George the jewellery hes given me and the little enamel casket we bought together\nwhen we were engaged.",
    "To Gloria King my platinum cigarette case.",
    "To Maisie my Chinese Pottery horse that\nshes always admirIt stopped there with a frantic scrawl of the pen as Rosemary had dashed it down and\ngiven way to uncontrollable weeping.",
    "Iris stood as though turned to stone.",
    "What did it mean Rosemary wasnt going to die was she Shed been very ill with\ninfluenza but she was all right now.",
    "And anyway people didnt die of flu  at least\nsometimes they did but Rosemary hadnt.",
    "She was quite well now only weak and run\ndown.",
    "Iriss eyes went over the words again and this time a phrase stood out with startling effect\n... my money goes to you anyway...",
    "It was the first intimation she had had of the terms of Paul Bennetts will.",
    "She had known\nsince she was a child that Rosemary had inherited Uncle Pauls money that Rosemary was\nrich whilst she herself was comparatively poor.",
    "But until this moment she had never\nquestioned what would happen to that money on Rosemarys death.",
    "If she had been asked she would have replied that she supposed it would go to George as\nRosemarys husband but would have added that it seemed absurd to think of Rosemary\ndying before George\nBut here it was set down in black and white in Rosemarys own hand.",
    "At Rosemarys\ndeath the money came to her Iris.",
    "But surely that wasnt legal A husband or wife got any\nmoney not a sister.",
    "Unless of course Paul Bennett had left it that way in his will.",
    "Yes that\nmust be it.",
    "Uncle Paul had said the money was to go to her if Rosemary died.",
    "That did\nmake it rather less unfair  Unfair She was startled as the word leapt to her thoughts.",
    "Had\nshe been thinking that it was unfair for Rosemary to get all Uncle Pauls money She\nsupposed that deep down she must have been feeling just that.",
    "It was unfair.",
    "They were\nsisters she and Rosemary.",
    "They were both her mothers children.",
    "Why should Uncle Paul\ngive it all to Rosemary\nRosemary always had everything Parties and frocks and young men in love with her and\nan adoring husband.",
    "The only unpleasant thing that ever happened to Rosemary was having an attack of flu\nAnd even that hadnt lasted longer than a week\nIris hesitated standing by the desk.",
    "That sheet of paper  would Rosemary want it left\nabout for the servants to see\nAfter a minutes hesitation she picked it up folded it in two and slipped it into one of the\ndrawers of the desk.",
    "It was found there after the fatal birthday party and provided an additional proof if proof\nwas necessary that Rosemary had been in a depressed and unhappy state of mind after her\n\n\fillness and had possibly been thinking of suicide even then.",
    "Depression after influenza.",
    "That was the motive brought forward at the inquest the motive\nthat Iriss evidence helped to establish.",
    "An inadequate motive perhaps but the only one\navailable and consequently accepted.",
    "It had been a bad type of influenza that year.",
    "Neither Iris nor George Barton could have suggested any other motive  then.",
    "Now thinking back over the incident in the attic Iris wondered that she could have been so\nblind.",
    "The whole thing must have been going on under her eyes And she had seen nothing Her\nmind took a quick leap over the tragedy of the birthday party.",
    "No need to think of that\nThat was over  done with.",
    "Put away the horror of that and the inquest and Georges\ntwitching face and bloodshot eyes.",
    "Go straight on to the incident of the trunk in the attic.",
    "II\nThat had been about six months after Rosemarys death.",
    "Iris had continued to live at the house in Elvaston Square.",
    "After the funeral the Marle\nfamily solicitor a courtly old gentleman with a shining bald head and unexpectedly shrewd\neyes had had an interview with Iris.",
    "He had explained with admirable clarity that under\nthe will of Paul Bennett Rosemary had inherited his estate in trust to pass at her death to\nany children she might have.",
    "If Rosemary died childless the estate was to go to Iris\nabsolutely.",
    "It was the solicitor explained a very large fortune which would belong to her\nabsolutely upon attaining the age of twentyone or on her marriage.",
    "In the meantime the first thing to settle was her place of residence.",
    "Mr George Barton had\nshown himself anxious for her to continue living with him and had suggested that her\nfathers sister Mrs Drake who was in impoverished circumstances owing to the financial\nclaims of a son the black sheep of the Marle family should make her home with them and\nchaperon Iris in society.",
    "Did Iris approve of this plan\nIris had been quite willing thankful not to have to make new plans.",
    "Aunt Lucilla she\nremembered as an amiable elderly sheep with little will of her own.",
    "So the matter had been settled.",
    "George Barton had been touchingly pleased to have his\nwifes sister still with him and treated her affectionately as a younger sister.",
    "Mrs Drake if\nnot a stimulating companion was completely subservient to Iriss wishes.",
    "The household\nsettled down amicably.",
    "It was nearly six months later that Iris made her discovery in the attic.",
    "The attics of the Elvaston Square house were used as storage rooms for odds and ends of\nfurniture and a number of trunks and suitcases.",
    "Iris had gone up there one day after an unsuccessful hunt for an old red pullover for which\nshe had an affection.",
    "George had begged her not to wear mourning for Rosemary\nRosemary had always been opposed to the idea he said.",
    "This Iris knew was true so she\nacquiesced and continued to wear ordinary clothes somewhat to the disapproval of Lucilla\nDrake who was oldfashioned and liked what she called the decencies to be observed.",
    "Mrs Drake herself was still inclined to wear cr\u00eape for a husband deceased some twentyodd\nyears ago.",
    "Various unwanted clothes Iris knew had been packed away in a trunk upstairs.",
    "She\nstarted hunting through it for her pullover coming across as she did so various forgotten\nbelongings a grey coat and skirt a pile of stockings her skiing kit and one or two old\n\n\fbathing dresses.",
    "It was then that she came across an old dressinggown that had belonged to Rosemary and\nwhich had somehow or other escaped being given away with the rest of Rosemarys things.",
    "It was a mannish affair of spotted silk with big pockets.",
    "Iris shook it out noting that it was in perfectly good condition.",
    "Then she folded it carefully\nand returned it to the trunk.",
    "As she did so her hand felt something crackle in one of the\npockets.",
    "She thrust in her hand and drew out a crumpledup piece of paper.",
    "It was in\nRosemarys handwriting and she smoothed it out and read it.",
    "Leopard darling you cant mean it... You cant  you cant... We love each other We\nbelong together You must know that just as I know it We cant just say goodbye and go\non coolly with our own lives.",
    "You know thats impossible darling  quite impossible.",
    "You\nand I belong together  for ever and ever.",
    "Im not a conventional woman  I dont mind\nabout what people say.",
    "Love matters more to me than anything else.",
    "Well go away\ntogether  and be happy  Ill make you happy.",
    "You said to me once that life without me\nwas dust and ashes to you  do you remember Leopard darling And now you write calmly\nthat all this had better end  that its only fair to me.",
    "Fair to me But I cant live without\nyou Im sorry about George  hes always been sweet to me  but hell understand.",
    "Hell\nwant to give me my freedom.",
    "It isnt right to live together if you dont love each other any\nmore.",
    "God meant us for each other darling  I know He did.",
    "Were going to be wonderfully\nhappy  but we must be brave.",
    "I shall tell George myself  I want to be quite straight about\nthe whole thing  but not until after my birthday.",
    "I know Im doing whats right Leopard darling  and I cant live without you  cant cant cant.",
    "How stupid it is of me to write all this.",
    "Two lines would have done.",
    "Just I love you.",
    "Im never going to let you go.",
    "Oh darling \nThe letter broke off.",
    "Iris stood motionless staring down it.",
    "How little one knew of ones own sister So Rosemary\nhad had a lover  had written him passionate love letters  had planned to go away with\nhim\nWhat had happened Rosemary had never sent the letter after all.",
    "What letter had she\nsent What had been finally decided between Rosemary and this unknown man\nLeopard What extraordinary fancies people had when they were in love.",
    "So silly.",
    "Leopard indeed\nWho was this man Did he love Rosemary as much as she loved him Surely he must have\ndone.",
    "Rosemary was so unbelievably lovely.",
    "And yet according to Rosemarys letter he\nhad suggested ending it all.",
    "That suggested  what Caution He had evidently said that\nthe break was for Rosemarys sake.",
    "That it was only fair to her.",
    "Yes but didnt men say that sort of thing to save their faces\nDidnt it really mean that the man whoever he was was tired of it all Perhaps it had been\nto him a mere passing distraction.",
    "Perhaps he had never really cared.",
    "Somehow Iris got the\nimpression that that unknown man had been very determined to break with Rosemary\nfinally...",
    "But Rosemary had thought differently.",
    "Rosemary wasnt going to count the cost.",
    "Rosemary\nhad been determined too...\nIris shivered.",
    "And she Iris hadnt known a thing about it Hadnt even guessed Had taken it for\ngranted that Rosemary was happy and contented and that she and George were quite\n\n\fsatisfied with one another.",
    "Blind She must have been blind not to know a thing like that\nabout her own sister.",
    "But who was that man\nShe cast her mind back thinking remembering.",
    "There had been so many men about\nadmiring Rosemary taking her out ringing her up.",
    "There had been no one special.",
    "But\nthere must have been  the rest of the bunch were mere camouflage for the one the only\none that mattered.",
    "Iris frowned perplexedly sorting her remembrances carefully.",
    "Two names stood out.",
    "It must yes positively it must be one or the other.",
    "Stephen Farraday It must be Stephen Farraday.",
    "What could Rosemary have seen in him\nA stiff pompous young man  and not so very young either.",
    "Of course people did say he was\nbrilliant.",
    "A rising politician an undersecretaryship prophesied in the near future and all\nthe weight of the influential Kidderminster connection behind him.",
    "A possible future Prime\nMinister Was that what had given him glamour in Rosemarys eyes Surely she couldnt\ncare so desperately for the man himself  such a cold selfcontained creature But they said\nthat his own wife was passionately in love with him that she had gone against all the wishes\nof her powerful family in marrying him  a mere nobody with political ambitions If one\nwoman felt like that about him another woman might also.",
    "Yes it must be Stephen Farraday.",
    "Because if it wasnt Stephen Farraday it must be Anthony Browne.",
    "And Iris didnt want it to be Anthony Browne.",
    "True hed been very much Rosemarys slave constantly at her beck and call his dark\ngoodlooking face expressing a kind of humorous desperation.",
    "But surely that devotion had\nbeen too open too freely declared to go really deep\nOdd the way he had disappeared after Rosemarys death.",
    "They had none of them seen him\nsince.",
    "Still not so odd really  he was a man who travelled a lot.",
    "He had talked about the\nArgentine and Canada and Uganda and the U.S.A. She had an idea that he was actually an\nAmerican or a Canadian though he had hardly any accent.",
    "No it wasnt really strange\nthat they shouldnt have seen anything of him since.",
    "It was Rosemary who had been his friend.",
    "There was no reason why he should go on\ncoming to see the rest of them.",
    "He had been Rosemarys friend.",
    "But not Rosemarys lover\nShe didnt want him to have been Rosemarys lover.",
    "That would hurt  that would hurt\nterribly...\nShe looked down at the letter in her hand.",
    "She crumpled it up.",
    "Shed throw it away burn\nit...",
    "It was sheer instinct that stopped her.",
    "Some day it might be important to produce that\nletter...\nShe smoothed it out took it down with her and locked it away in her jewel case.",
    "It might be\nimportant some day to show why Rosemary took her own life.",
    "III\nAnd the next thing please\nThe ridiculous phrase came unbidden into Iriss mind and twisted her lips in a wry smile.",
    "The glib shopkeepers question seemed to represent so exactly her own carefully directed\nmental processes.",
    "Was not that exactly what she was trying to do in her survey of the past She had dealt\nwith the surprising discovery in the attic.",
    "And now  on to the next thing please What\nwas the next thing\nSurely the increasingly odd behaviour of George.",
    "That dated back for a long time.",
    "Little\nthings that had puzzled her became clear now in the light of the surprising interview last\nnight.",
    "Disconnected remarks and actions took their proper place in the course of events.",
    "And there was the reappearance of Anthony Browne.",
    "Yes perhaps that ought to come next\nin sequence since it had followed the finding of the letter by just one week.",
    "Iris couldnt\nrecall her sensations exactly...\nRosemary had died in November.",
    "In the following May Iris under the wing of Lucilla\nDrake had started her social young girls life.",
    "She had gone to luncheons and teas and\ndances without however enjoying them very much.",
    "She had felt listless and unsatisfied.",
    "It\nwas at a somewhat dull dance towards the end of June that she heard a voice say behind\nher\nIt is Iris Marle isnt it\nShe had turned flushing to look into Anthonys  Tonys  dark quizzical face.",
    "He said I dont expect you remember me but \nShe interrupted.",
    "Oh but I do remember you.",
    "Of course I do\nSplendid.",
    "I was afraid youd have forgotten me.",
    "Its such a long time since I saw you.",
    "I know.",
    "Not since Rosemarys birthday par\nShe stopped.",
    "The words had come gaily unthinkingly to her lips.",
    "Now the colour rushed\naway from her cheeks leaving them white and drained of blood.",
    "Her lips quivered.",
    "Her\neyes were suddenly wide and dismayed.",
    "Anthony Browne said quickly Im terribly sorry.",
    "Im a brute to have reminded you.",
    "Iris swallowed.",
    "She said Its all right.",
    "Not since the night of Rosemarys birthday party.",
    "Not since the night of Rosemarys\nsuicide.",
    "She wouldnt think of it.",
    "She would not think of it\nAnthony Browne said again Im terribly sorry.",
    "Please forgive me.",
    "Shall we dance\nShe nodded.",
    "Although already engaged for the dance that was just beginning she had\nfloated on to the floor in his arms.",
    "She saw her partner a blushing immature young man\nwhose collar seemed too big for him peering about for her.",
    "The sort of partner she\nthought scornfully that debs have to put up with.",
    "Not like this man  Rosemarys friend.",
    "A sharp pang went through her.",
    "Rosemarys friend.",
    "That letter.",
    "Had it been written to this\nman she was dancing with now Something in the easy feline grace with which he danced\nlent substance to the nickname Leopard.",
    "Had he and Rosemary She said sharply Where have you been all this time\nHe held her a little away from him looking down into her face.",
    "He was unsmiling now his\nvoice held coldness.",
    "Ive been travelling  on business.",
    "I see.",
    "She went on uncontrollably Why have you come back\nHe smiled then.",
    "He said lightly Perhaps  to see you Iris Marle.",
    "And suddenly gathering her up a little closer he executed a long daring glide through the\ndancers a miracle of timing and steering.",
    "Iris wondered why with a sensation that was\nalmost wholly pleasure she should feel afraid.",
    "Since then Anthony had definitely become part of her life.",
    "She saw him at least once a\n\n\fweek.",
    "She met him in the Park at various dances found him put next to her at dinner.",
    "The only place he never came to was the house in Elvaston Square.",
    "It was some time before\nshe noticed this so adroitly did he manage to evade or refuse invitations there.",
    "When she did realise it she began to wonder why.",
    "Was it because he and Rosemary  Then\nto her astonishment George easygoing noninterfering George spoke to her about him.",
    "Whos this fellow Anthony Browne youre going about with What do you know about\nhim\nShe stared at him.",
    "Know about him Why he was a friend of Rosemarys\nGeorges face twitched.",
    "He blinked.",
    "He said in a dull heavy voice Yes of course so he\nwas.",
    "Iris cried remorsefully Im sorry.",
    "I shouldnt have reminded you.",
    "George Barton shook his head.",
    "He said gently No no I dont want her forgotten.",
    "Never\nthat.",
    "After all he spoke awkwardly his eyes averted thats what her name means.",
    "Rosemary  remembrance.",
    "He looked full at her.",
    "I dont want you to forget your sister Iris.",
    "She caught her breath.",
    "I never shall.",
    "George went on But about this young fellow Anthony Browne.",
    "Rosemary may have liked\nhim but I dont believe she knew much about him.",
    "You know youve got to be careful Iris.",
    "Youre a very rich young woman.",
    "A kind of burning anger swept over her.",
    "Tony  Anthony  has plenty of money himself.",
    "Why he stays at Claridges when hes in\nLondon.",
    "George Barton smiled a little.",
    "He murmured Eminently respectable  as well as costly.",
    "All\nthe same my dear nobody seems to know much about this fellow.",
    "Hes an American.",
    "Perhaps.",
    "If so its odd he isnt sponsored more by his own Embassy.",
    "He doesnt come\nmuch to this house does he\nNo.",
    "And I can see why if youre so horrid about him\nGeorge shook his head.",
    "Seem to have put my foot in it.",
    "Oh well.",
    "Only wanted to give you a timely warning.",
    "Ill\nhave a word with Lucilla.",
    "Lucilla said Iris scornfully.",
    "George said anxiously Is everything all right I mean does Lucilla see to it that you get\nthe sort of time you ought to have Parties  all that sort of thing\nYes indeed she works like a beaver...\nBecause if not youve only got to say you know child.",
    "We could get hold of someone else.",
    "Someone younger and more up to date.",
    "I want you to enjoy yourself.",
    "I do George.",
    "Oh George I do.",
    "He said rather heavily Then thats all right.",
    "Im not much hand at these shows myself never was.",
    "But see to it you get everything you want.",
    "Theres no need to stint expense.",
    "That was George all over  kind awkward blundering.",
    "True to his promise or threat he had a word with Mrs Drake on the subject of Anthony\nBrowne but as Fate would have it the moment was unpropitious for gaining Lucillas full\n\n\fattention.",
    "She had just had a cable from that neerdowell son who was the apple of her eye and who\nknew only too well how to wring the maternal heartstrings to his own financial advantage.",
    "Can you send me two hundred pounds.",
    "Desperate.",
    "Life or death.",
    "Victor.",
    "Lucilla was crying.",
    "Victor is so honourable.",
    "He knows how straitened my circumstances are and hed never\napply to me except in the last resource.",
    "He never has.",
    "Im always so afraid hell shoot\nhimself.",
    "Not he said George Barton unfeelingly.",
    "You dont know him.",
    "Im his mother and naturally I know what my own son is like.",
    "I\nshould never forgive myself if I didnt do what he asked.",
    "I could manage by selling out\nthose shares.",
    "George sighed.",
    "Look here Lucilla.",
    "Ill get full information by cable from one of my correspondents out\nthere.",
    "Well find out just exactly what sort of jam Victors in.",
    "But my advice to you is to let\nhim stew in his own juice.",
    "Hell never make good until you do.",
    "Youre so hard George.",
    "The poor boy has always been unlucky \nGeorge repressed his opinions on that point.",
    "Never any good arguing with women.",
    "He merely said Ill get Ruth on to it at once.",
    "We should hear by tomorrow.",
    "Lucilla was partially appeased.",
    "The two hundred was eventually cut down to fifty but that\namount Lucilla firmly insisted on sending.",
    "George Iris knew provided the amount himself though pretending to Lucilla that he was\nselling her shares.",
    "Iris admired George very much for his generosity and said so.",
    "His\nanswer was simple.",
    "Way I look at it  always some black sheep in the family.",
    "Always someone whos got to be\nkept.",
    "Someone or other will have to fork out for Victor until he dies.",
    "But it neednt be you.",
    "Hes not your family.",
    "Rosemarys familys mine.",
    "Youre a darling George.",
    "But couldnt I do it Youre always telling me Im rolling.",
    "He grinned at her.",
    "Cant do anything of that kind until youre twentyone young woman.",
    "And if youre wise\nyou wont do it then.",
    "But Ill give you one tip.",
    "When a fellow wires that hell end everything\nunless he gets a couple of hundred by return youll usually find that twenty pounds will be\nample...",
    "I daresay a tenner would do You cant stop a mother coughing up but you can\nreduce the amount  remember that.",
    "Of course Victor Drake would never do away with\nhimself not he These people who threaten suicide never do it.",
    "Never Iris thought of Rosemary.",
    "Then she pushed the thought away.",
    "George wasnt\nthinking of Rosemary.",
    "He was thinking of an unscrupulous plausible young man in Rio de\nJaneiro.",
    "The net gain from Iriss point of view was that Lucillas maternal preoccupations kept her\nfrom paying full attention to Iriss friendship with Anthony Browne.",
    "So  on to the next thing.",
    "Madam.",
    "The change in George Iris couldnt put it off any\nlonger.",
    "When had that begun What was the cause of it\nEven now thinking back Iris could not put her finger definitely on the moment when it\nbegan.",
    "Ever since Rosemarys death George had been abstracted had had fits of\ninattention and brooding.",
    "He had seemed older heavier.",
    "That was all natural enough.",
    "But\n\n\fwhen exactly had his abstraction become something more than natural\nIt was she thought after their clash over Anthony Browne that she had first noticed him\nstaring at her in a bemused perplexed manner.",
    "Then he formed a new habit of coming\nhome early from business and shutting himself up in his study.",
    "He didnt seem to be doing\nanything there.",
    "She had gone in once and found him sitting at his desk staring straight\nahead of him.",
    "He looked at her when she came in with dull lacklustre eyes.",
    "He behaved\nlike a man who has had a shock but to her question as to what was the matter he replied\nbriefly Nothing.",
    "As the days went on he went about with the careworn look of a man who has some definite\nworry upon his mind.",
    "Nobody had paid very much attention.",
    "Iris certainly hadnt.",
    "Worries were always\nconveniently business.",
    "Then at odd intervals and with no seeming reason he began to ask questions.",
    "It was then\nthat she began to put his manner down as definitely queer.",
    "Look here Iris did Rosemary ever talk to you much\nIris stared at him.",
    "Why of course George.",
    "At least  well about what\nOh herself  her friends  how things were going with her.",
    "Whether she was happy or\nunhappy.",
    "That sort of thing.",
    "She thought she saw what was in his mind.",
    "He must have got wind of Rosemarys unhappy\nlove affair.",
    "She said slowly She never said much.",
    "I mean  she was always busy  doing things.",
    "And you were only a kid of course.",
    "Yes I know.",
    "All the same I thought she might have\nsaid something.",
    "He looked at her inquiringly  rather like a hopeful dog.",
    "She didnt want George to be hurt.",
    "And anyway Rosemary never had said anything.",
    "She shook her head.",
    "George sighed.",
    "He said heavily Oh well it doesnt matter.",
    "Another day he asked her suddenly who Rosemarys best women friends had been.",
    "Iris reflected.",
    "Gloria King.",
    "Mrs Atwell  Maisie Atwell.",
    "Jean Raymond.",
    "How intimate was she with them\nWell I dont know exactly.",
    "I mean do you think she might have confided in any of them\nI dont really know...",
    "I dont think its awfully likely... What sort of confidence do you\nmean\nImmediately she wished she hadnt asked that last question but Georges response to it\nsurprised her.",
    "Did Rosemary ever say she was afraid of anybody\nAfraid Iris stared.",
    "What Im trying to get at is did Rosemary have any enemies\nAmongst other women\nNo no not that kind of thing.",
    "Real enemies.",
    "There wasnt anyone  that you knew of who  who might have had it in for her\nIriss frank stare seemed to upset him.",
    "He reddened muttered Sounds silly I know.",
    "Melodramatic but I just wondered.",
    "It was a day or two after that that he started asking about the Farradays.",
    "How much had Rosemary seen of the Farradays\nIris was doubtful.",
    "I really dont know George.",
    "Did she ever talk about them\nNo I dont think so.",
    "Were they intimate at all\nRosemary was very interested in politics.",
    "Yes.",
    "After she met the Farradays in Switzerland.",
    "Never cared a button about politics\nbefore that.",
    "No.",
    "I think Stephen Farraday interested her in them.",
    "He used to lend her pamphlets and\nthings.",
    "George said What did Sandra Farraday think about it\nAbout what\nAbout her husband lending Rosemary pamphlets.",
    "Iris said uncomfortably I dont know.",
    "George said Shes a very reserved woman.",
    "Looks cold as ice.",
    "But they say shes crazy\nabout Farraday.",
    "Sort of woman who might resent his having a friendship with another\nwoman.",
    "Perhaps.",
    "How did Rosemary and Farradays wife get on\nIris said slowly I dont think they did.",
    "Rosemary laughed at Sandra.",
    "Said she was one of\nthose stuffed political women like a rocking horse.",
    "She is rather like a horse you know.",
    "Rosemary used to say that if you pricked her sawdust would ooze out.",
    "George grunted.",
    "Then he said Still seeing a good deal of Anthony Browne\nA fair amount.",
    "Iriss voice was cold but George did not repeat his warnings.",
    "Instead he\nseemed interested.",
    "Knocked about a good deal hasnt he Must have had an interesting life.",
    "Does he ever\ntalk to you about it\nNot much.",
    "Hes travelled a lot of course.",
    "Business I suppose.",
    "I suppose so.",
    "What is his business\nI dont know.",
    "Something to do with armament firms isnt it\nHes never said.",
    "Well neednt mention I asked.",
    "I just wondered.",
    "He was about a lot last Autumn with\nDewsbury whos chairman of the United Arms Ltd... Rosemary saw rather a lot of\nAnthony Browne didnt she\nYes  yes she did.",
    "But she hadnt known him very long  he was more or less of a casual acquaintance Used\nto take her dancing didnt he\nYes.",
    "I was rather surprised you know that she wanted him at her birthday party.",
    "Didnt\nrealise she knew him so well.",
    "Iris said quietly He dances very well...",
    "Yes  yes of course...",
    "Without wishing to Iris unwillingly let a picture of that evening flit across her mind.",
    "The\nround table at the Luxembourg the shaded lights the flowers.",
    "The dance band with its\ninsistent rhythm.",
    "The seven people round the table herself Anthony Browne Rosemary\nStephen Farraday Ruth Lessing George and on Georges right Stephen Farradays wife\nLady Alexandra Farraday with her pale straight hair and those slightly arched nostrils and\nher clear arrogant voice.",
    "Such a gay party it had been or hadnt it\nAnd in the middle of it Rosemary  No no better not think about that.",
    "Better only to\nremember herself sitting next to Tony  that was the first time she had really met him.",
    "Before that he had been only a name a shadow in the hall a back accompanying Rosemary\ndown the steps in front of the house to a waiting taxi.",
    "Tony She came back with a start.",
    "George was repeating a question.",
    "Funny he cleared off so soon after.",
    "Where did he go do you know\nShe said vaguely Oh Ceylon I think or India.",
    "Never mentioned it that night.",
    "Iris said sharply Why should he And have we got to talk about  that night\nHis face crimsoned over.",
    "No no of course not.",
    "Sorry old thing.",
    "By the way ask Browne to dinner one night.",
    "Id\nlike to meet him again.",
    "Iris was delighted.",
    "George was coming round.",
    "The invitation was duly given and accepted\nbut at the last minute Anthony had to go North on business and couldnt come.",
    "One day at the end of July George startled both Lucilla and Iris by announcing that he\nhad bought a house in the country.",
    "Bought a house.",
    "Iris was incredulous.",
    "But I thought we were going to rent that house at\nGoring for two months\nNicer to have a place of ones own  eh Can go down for weekends all through the year.",
    "Where is it On the river\nNot exactly.",
    "In fact not at all.",
    "Sussex.",
    "Marlingham.",
    "Little Priors its called.",
    "Twelve acres\n small Georgian house.",
    "Do you mean youve bought it without us even seeing it\nRather a chance.",
    "Just came into the market.",
    "Snapped it up.",
    "Mrs Drake said I suppose it will need a lot of doing up and redecorating.",
    "George said in an offhand way Oh thats all right.",
    "Ruth has seen to all that.",
    "They received the mention of Ruth Lessing Georges capable secretary in respectful\nsilence.",
    "Ruth was an institution  practically one of the family.",
    "Good looking in a severe\nblackandwhite kind of way she was the essence of efficiency combined with tact...\nDuring Rosemarys lifetime it had been usual for Rosemary to say Lets get Ruth to see\nto it.",
    "Shes marvellous.",
    "Oh leave it to Ruth.",
    "Every difficulty could always be smoothed out by Miss Lessings capable fingers.",
    "Smiling pleasant aloof she surmounted all obstacles.",
    "She ran Georges office and it was\nsuspected ran George as well.",
    "He was devoted to her and leaned upon her judgement in\nevery way.",
    "She seemed to have no needs no desires of her own.",
    "Nevertheless on this occasion Lucilla Drake was annoyed.",
    "My dear George capable as Ruth is well I mean  the women of a family do like to\narrange the colour scheme of their own drawingroom Iris should have been consulted.",
    "I\n\n\fsay nothing about myself.",
    "I do not count.",
    "But it is annoying for Iris.",
    "George looked consciencestricken.",
    "I wanted it to be a surprise\nLucilla had to smile.",
    "What a boy you are George.",
    "Iris said I dont mind about colour schemes.",
    "Im sure Ruth will have made it perfect.",
    "Shes so clever.",
    "What shall we do down there Theres a tennis court I suppose.",
    "Yes and golf links six miles away and its only about fourteen miles to the sea.",
    "Whats\nmore we shall have neighbours.",
    "Always wise to go to a part of the world where you know\nsomebody I think.",
    "What neighbours asked Iris sharply.",
    "George did not meet her eyes.",
    "The Farradays he said.",
    "They live about a mile and a half away just across the park.",
    "Iris stared at him.",
    "In a minute she leapt to the conviction that the whole of this elaborate\nbusiness the purchasing and equipping of a country house had been undertaken with one\nobject only  to bring George into close relationship with Stephen and Sandra Farraday.",
    "Near neighbours in the country with adjoining estates the two families were bound to be\non intimate terms.",
    "Either that or a deliberate coolness\nBut why Why this persistent harping on the Farradays Why this costly method of\nachieving an incomprehensible aim\nDid George suspect that Rosemary and Stephen Farraday had been something more than\nfriends Was this a strange manifestation of postmortem jealousy Surely that was a\nthought too farfetched for words\nBut what did George want from the Farradays What was the point of all the odd\nquestions he was continually shooting at her Iris Wasnt there something very queer\nabout George lately\nThe odd fuddled look he had in the evenings Lucilla attributed it to a glass or so too much\nof port.",
    "Lucilla would\nNo there was something queer about George lately.",
    "He seemed to be labouring under a\nmixture of excitement interlarded with great spaces of complete apathy when he sunk in a\ncoma.",
    "Most of that August they spent in the country at Little Priors.",
    "Horrible house Iris\nshivered.",
    "She hated it.",
    "A gracious wellbuilt house harmoniously furnished and decorated\nRuth Lessing was never at fault.",
    "And curiously frighteningly vacant.",
    "They didnt live\nthere.",
    "They occupied it.",
    "As soldiers in a war occupied some lookout post.",
    "What made it horrible was the overlay of ordinary normal summer living.",
    "People down for\nweekends tennis parties informal dinners with the Farradays.",
    "Sandra Farraday had been\ncharming to them  the perfect manner to neighbours who were already friends.",
    "She\nintroduced them to the county advised George and Iris about horses was prettily polite\nand deferential to Lucilla as an older woman.",
    "And behind the mask of her pale smiling face no one could know what she was thinking.",
    "A\nwoman like a sphinx.",
    "Of Stephen they had seen less.",
    "He was very busy often absent on political business.",
    "To Iris\nit seemed certain that he deliberately avoided the Little Priors party more than he could\nhelp.",
    "So August had passed and September and it was decided that in October they should go\n\n\fback to the London house.",
    "Iris had drawn a deep breath of relief.",
    "Perhaps once they were back George would return\nto his normal self.",
    "And then last night she had been roused by a low tapping on her door.",
    "She switched on\nthe light and glanced at the time.",
    "Only one oclock.",
    "She had gone to bed at halfpast ten and\nit had seemed to her it was much later.",
    "She threw on a dressinggown and went to the door.",
    "Somehow that seemed more natural\nthan just to shout Come in.",
    "George was standing outside.",
    "He had not been to bed and was still in his evening clothes.",
    "His breath was coming unevenly and his face was a curious blue colour.",
    "He said Come down to the study Iris.",
    "Ive got to talk to you.",
    "Ive got to talk to someone.",
    "Wondering still dazed with sleep she obeyed.",
    "Inside the study he shut the door and motioned her to sit opposite him at the desk.",
    "He\npushed the cigarette box across to her at the same time taking one and lighting it after one\nor two attempts with a shaking hand.",
    "She said Is anything the matter George\nShe was really alarmed now.",
    "He looked ghastly.",
    "George spoke between small gasps like a man who has been running.",
    "I cant go on by myself.",
    "I cant keep it any longer.",
    "Youve got to tell me what you think whether its true  whether its possible \nBut what is it youre talking about George\nYou must have noticed something seen something.",
    "There must have been something she\nsaid.",
    "There must have been a reason.",
    "She stared at him.",
    "He passed his hand over his forehead.",
    "You dont understand what Im talking about.",
    "I can see that.",
    "Dont look so scared little\ngirl.",
    "Youve got to help me.",
    "Youve got to remember every damned thing you can.",
    "Now\nnow I know I sound a bit incoherent but youll understand in a minute  when Ive shown\nyou the letters.",
    "He unlocked one of the drawers at the side of the desk and took out two single sheets of\npaper.",
    "They were of a pale innocuous blue with words printed on them in small prim letters.",
    "Read that said George.",
    "Iris stared down at the paper.",
    "What it said was quite clear and devoid of circumlocution\nYOU THINK YOUR WIFE COMMITTED SUICIDE.",
    "SHE DIDNT.",
    "SHE WAS\nKILLED.",
    "The second ran\nYOUR WIFE ROSEMARY DIDNT KILL HERSELF.",
    "SHE WAS MURDERED.",
    "As Iris stayed staring at the words George went on\nThey came about three months ago.",
    "At first I thought it was a joke  a cruel rotten sort of\njoke.",
    "Then I began to think.",
    "Why should Rosemary have killed herself\nIris said in a mechanical voice Depression after influenza.",
    "Yes but really when you come to think of it thats rather piffle isnt it I mean lots of\npeople have influenza and feel a bit depressed afterwards  what\nIris said with an effort She might  have been unhappy\nYes I suppose she might.",
    "George considered the point quite calmly.",
    "But all the same I\ndont see Rosemary putting an end to herself because she was unhappy.",
    "She might threaten\n\n\fto but I dont think she would really do it when it came to the point.",
    "But she must have done George What other explanation could there be Why they even\nfound the stuff in her handbag.",
    "I know.",
    "It all hangs together.",
    "But ever since these came he tapped the anonymous letters\nwith his fingernail Ive been turning things over in my mind.",
    "And the more Ive thought\nabout it the more I feel sure theres something in it.",
    "Thats why Ive asked you all those\nquestions  about Rosemary ever making any enemies.",
    "About anything shed ever said that\nsounded as though she were afraid of someone.",
    "Whoever killed her must have had a reason\n\nBut George youre crazy \nSometimes I think I am.",
    "Other times I know that Im on the right track.",
    "But Ive got to\nknow.",
    "Ive got to find out.",
    "Youve got to help me Iris.",
    "Youve got to think.",
    "Youve got to\nremember.",
    "Thats it  remember.",
    "Go back over that night again and again.",
    "Because you do\nsee dont you that if she was killed it must have been someone who was at the table that\nnight You do see that dont you\nYes she had seen that.",
    "There was no pushing aside the remembrance of that scene any\nlonger.",
    "She must remember it all.",
    "The music the roll of drums the lowered lights the\ncabaret and the lights going up again and Rosemary sprawled forward on the table her\nface blue and convulsed.",
    "Iris shivered.",
    "She was frightened now  horribly frightened...\nShe must think  go back  remember.",
    "Rosemary thats for remembrance.",
    "There was to be no oblivion.",
    "Chapter 2\nRUTH LESSING\nRuth Lessing during a momentary lull in her busy day was remembering her employers\nwife Rosemary Barton.",
    "She had disliked Rosemary Barton a good deal.",
    "She had never known quite how much until\nthat November morning when she had first talked with Victor Drake.",
    "That interview with Victor had been the beginning of it all had set the whole train in\nmotion.",
    "Before then the things she had felt and thought had been so far below the stream\nof her consciousness that she hadnt really known about them.",
    "She was devoted to George Barton.",
    "She always had been.",
    "When she had first come to him\na cool competent young woman of twentythree she had seen that he needed taking charge\nof.",
    "She had taken charge of him.",
    "She had saved him time money and worry.",
    "She had\nchosen his friends for him and directed him to suitable hobbies.",
    "She had restrained him\nfrom illadvised business adventures and encouraged him to take judicious risks on\noccasions.",
    "Never once in their long association had George suspected her of being anything\nother than subservient attentive and entirely directed by himself.",
    "He took a distinct\npleasure in her appearance the neat shining dark head the smart tailormades and the\ncrisp shirts the small pearls in her wellshaped ears the pale discreetly powdered face and\nthe faint restrained rose shade of her lipstick.",
    "Ruth he felt was absolutely right.",
    "He liked her detached impersonal manner her complete\nabsence of sentiment or familiarity.",
    "In consequence he talked to her a good deal about his\n\n\fprivate affairs and she listened sympathetically and always put in a useful word of advice.",
    "She had nothing to do however with his marriage.",
    "She did not like it.",
    "However she\naccepted it and was invaluable in helping with the wedding arrangements relieving Mrs\nMarle of a great deal of work.",
    "For a time after the marriage Ruth was on slightly less\nconfidential terms with her employer.",
    "She confided herself strictly to the office affairs.",
    "George left a good deal in her hands.",
    "Nevertheless such was her efficiency that Rosemary soon found that Georges Miss Lessing\nwas an invaluable aid in all sorts of ways.",
    "Miss Lessing was always pleasant smiling and\npolite.",
    "George Rosemary and Iris all called her Ruth and she often came to Elvaston Square to\nlunch.",
    "She was now twentynine and looked exactly the same as she had looked at\ntwentythree.",
    "Without an intimate word ever passing between them she was always perfectly aware of\nGeorges slightest emotional reactions.",
    "She knew when the first elation of his married life\npassed into an ecstatic content she was aware when that content gave way to something\nelse that was not so easy to define.",
    "A certain inattention to detail shown by him at this time\nwas corrected by her own forethought.",
    "However distrait George might be Ruth Lessing never seemed to be aware of it.",
    "He was\ngrateful to her for that.",
    "It was on a November morning that he spoke to her of Victor Drake.",
    "I want you to do a rather unpleasant job for me Ruth\nShe looked at him inquiringly.",
    "No need to say that certainly she would do it.",
    "That was\nunderstood.",
    "Every familys got a black sheep said George.",
    "She nodded comprehendingly.",
    "This is a cousin of my wifes  a thorough bad hat Im afraid.",
    "Hes half ruined his mother\n a fatuous sentimental soul who has sold out most of what few shares she has on his behalf.",
    "He started by forging a cheque at Oxford  they got that hushed up and since then hes\nbeen shipped about the world  never making good anywhere.",
    "Ruth listened without much interest.",
    "She was familiar with the type.",

    "She preferred success.",
    "Hes turned up now in London and I find hes been worrying my wife.",
    "She hadnt set eyes\non him since she was a schoolgirl but hes a plausible sort of scoundrel and hes been\nwriting to her for money and Im not going to stand for that.",
    "Ive made an appointment\nwith him for twelve oclock this morning at his hotel.",
    "I want you to deal with it for me.",
    "The\nfact is I dont want to get into contact with the fellow.",
    "Ive never met him and I never want\nto and I dont want Rosemary to meet him.",

    "You dont know how much I rely on you for everything  he repeated everything.",
    "Youre the kindest dearest most helpful girl in the world\nRuth said laughing to hide her pleasure and embarrassment Youll spoil me saying such\nnice things.",

    "He was very much as she had pictured him though perhaps definitely more attractive.",
    "She\nmade no mistake in her estimate of his character.",
    "There was not much good in Victor\nDrake.",
    "As coldhearted and calculating a personality as could exist well masked behind an\nagreeable devilry.",
    "What she had not allowed for was his power of reading other peoples\nsouls and the practised ease with which he could play on the emotions.",

    "And only an hour later  No he\nwouldnt think of that.",
    "Not just now.",
    "His plan.",
    "He would think of The Plan.",
    "Hed speak to Race first.",
    "Hed show Race the letters.",
    "What would Race make of these\nletters Iris had been dumbfounded.",
    "She evidently hadnt had the slightest idea.",
    "Well he\nwas in charge of the situation now.",
    "Hed got it all taped.",
    "The Plan.",
    "All worked out.",
    "The date.",
    "The place.",
    "Nov. 2nd.",
    "All Souls Day.",
    "That was a good touch.",
    "The Luxembourg of course.",
    "Hed try to\nget the same table.",
    "And the same guests.",
    "Anthony Browne Stephen Farraday Sandra Farraday.",
    "Then of\ncourse Ruth and Iris and himself.",
    "And as the odd the seventh guest hed get Race.",
    "Race\nwho was originally to have been at the dinner.",
    "And there would be one empty place.",
    "It\nwould be splendid\nDramatic\nA repetition of the crime.",
    "Well not quite a repetition...\nHis mind went back...\nRosemarys birthday...\nRosemary sprawled forward on that table  dead...\n\nBook II  ALL SAINTS DAY\nHere is the rosemary which brings remembrance\nChapter 1\nLucilla Drake was twittering.",
    "That was the term always used in the family and it was really\na very apt description of the sounds that issued from Lucillas kindly lips.",
    "She was concerned on this particular morning with many things  so many that she found it\nhard to pin her attention down to one at a time.",
    "There was the imminence of the move back\nto town and the household problems involved in that move.",
    "Servants housekeeping winter\nstorage a thousand minor details  all these contended with a concern over Iriss looks.",
    "Really dear I feel quite anxious about you  you look so white and washed out  as though\nyou hadnt slept  did you sleep If not theres that nice sleeping preparation of Dr Wylies\nor was it Dr Gaskells  which reminds me  I shall have to go and speak to the grocer\nmyself  either the maids have been ordering in things on their own or else its deliberate\nswindling on his part.",
    "Packets and packets of soap flakes  and I never allow more than\n\n\fthree a week.",
    "But perhaps a tonic would be better Batons syrup they used to give when I\nwas a girl.",
    "And spinach of course.",
    "Ill tell cook to have spinach for lunch today.",
    "Iris was too languid and too used to Mrs Drakes discursive style to inquire why the\nmention of Dr Gaskell should have reminded her aunt of the local grocer though had she\ndone so she would have received the immediate response Because the grocers name is\nCranford my dear.",
    "Aunt Lucillas reasoning was always crystal clear to herself.",
    "Iris merely said with what energy she could command Im perfectly well Aunt Lucilla.",
    "Black under the eyes said Mrs Drake.",
    "Youve been doing too much.",
    "Ive done nothing at all  for weeks.",
    "So you think dear.",
    "But too much tennis is overtiring for young girls.",
    "And I think the air\ndown here is inclined to be enervating.",
    "This place is in a hollow.",
    "If George had consulted\nme instead of that girl.",
    "Girl\nThat Miss Lessing he thinks so much of.",
    "All very well in the office I daresay  but a great\nmistake to take her out of her place.",
    "Encourage her to think herself one of the family.",
    "Not\nthat she needs much encouragement I should say.",
    "Oh well Aunt Lucilla Ruth is practically one of the family.",
    "Mrs Drake sniffed.",
    "She means to be  thats quite clear.",
    "Poor George  really an infant in\narms where women are concerned.",
    "But it wont do Iris.",
    "George must be protected from\nhimself and if I were you I should make it very clear that nice as Miss Lessing is any idea\nof marriage is out of the question.",
    "Iris was startled for a moment out of her apathy.",
    "I never thought of George marrying Ruth.",
    "You dont see what goes on under your nose child.",
    "Of course you havent had my\nexperience of life.",
    "Iris smiled in spite of herself.",
    "Aunt Lucilla was really very funny\nsometimes.",
    "That young woman is out for matrimony.",
    "Would it matter asked Iris.",
    "Matter Of course it would matter.",
    "Wouldnt it really be rather nice Her aunt stared at her.",
    "Nice for George I mean.",
    "I\nthink youre right about her you know.",
    "I think she is fond of him.",
    "And shed be an awfully\ngood wife to him and look after him.",
    "Mrs Drake snorted and an almost indignant expression appeared on her rather sheeplike\namiable face.",
    "George is well looked after at present.",
    "What more can he want I should like to know\nExcellent meals and his mending seen to.",
    "Very pleasant for him to have an attractive young\ngirl like you about the house and when you marry some day I should hope I was still\ncapable of seeing to his comfort and looking after his health.",
    "Just as well or better than a\nyoung woman out of an office could do  what does she know about housekeeping Figures\nand ledgers and shorthand and typing  what good is that in a mans home\nIris smiled and shook her head but she did not argue the point.",
    "She was thinking of the\nsmooth dark satin of Ruths head of the clear complexion and the figure so well set off by\nthe severe tailormades that Ruth affected.",
    "Poor Aunt Lucilla all her mind on comfort and housekeeping with romance so very far\nbehind her that she had probably forgotten what it meant  if indeed thought Iris\nremembering her uncle by marriage it had ever meant anything to her.",
    "Lucilla Drake was Hector Marles halfsister from the fathers earlier marriage.",
    "When her\n\n\fstepmother died she had performed the part of a mother to Hector who was much\nyounger.",
    "Taking care of her father she went towards spinsterhood and was nearly forty\nwhen she met Reverend Caleb Drake who himself was over fifty.",
    "Her married life had\nbeen short.",
    "Two years later she was a widow with a child...\nMaternity late and unexpected had been the supreme experience in Lucillas life.",
    "Her son\nbecame to her an anxiety a source of suffering and a constant financial drain  but never a\ndisappointment.",
    "Mrs Drake refused to see in Victor anything more serious than a lovable weakness of\ncharacter.",
    "Victor was too trusting easily influenced by bad company due to his trusting\nnature.",
    "Victor had bad luck Victor was cheated on he was only a pawn to bad men who\nexploited his innocence.",
    "When any criticism to him was made Mrs Drakes simple and nice face became hard and\nobstinate.",
    "She knew her son  a good boy with the best intentions and his socalled friends\ntook advantage of him.",
    "Lucilla knew how he hated having to beg her for money.",
    "But what\ncould he do in such a terrible situation He had nobody else to turn to.",
    "Anyway Lucilla had to admit that the invitation to live at Georges house and take care of\nIris was a godsend.",
    "Her life in that house during the last year had been happy and\ncomfortable.",
    "And so she didnt like the idea of the young and efficient Ruth marrying\nGeorge and evicting her from this place.",
    "Miss Lessing was very presentable  but thank goodness there was one person at least who\nsaw what she was up to\nLucilla Drake nodded her head several times causing her soft double chins to quiver\nraised her eyebrows with an air of superb human sapience and abandoned the subject for\none equally interesting and possibly even more pressing.",
    "Its the blankets I cant make up my mind about dear.",
    "You see I cant get it clearly laid\ndown whether we shant be coming down again until next spring or whether George means\nto run down for weekends.",
    "He wont say.",
    "I suppose he doesnt really know.",
    "Iris tried to give her attention to a point that seemed\ncompletely unimportant.",
    "If it was nice weather it might be fun to come down occasionally.",
    "Though I dont think I want to particularly.",
    "Still the house will be here if we do want to\ncome.",
    "Yes dear but one wants to know.",
    "Because you see if we arent coming down until next\nyear then the blankets ought to be put away with moth balls.",
    "But if we are coming down\nthat wouldnt be necessary because the blankets would be used  and the smell of moth\nballs is so unpleasant.",
    "Well dont use them.",
    "Yes but its been such a hot summer there are a lot of moths about.",
    "Everyone says its a\nbad year for moths.",
    "And for wasps of course.",
    "Hawkins told me yesterday hes taken thirty\nwasps nests this summer  thirty  just fancy \nIris thought of Hawkins  stalking out at dusk  cyanide in hand  Cyanide  Rosemary Why did everything lead back to that\nThe thin trickle of sound that was Aunt Lucillas voice was going on  it had reached by\nnow a different point  and whether one ought to send the silver to the bank or not Lady Alexandra was saying\nso many burglaries  though of course we do have good shutters  I dont like the way she\ndoes her hair myself  it makes her face look so hard  but I should think she was a hard\n\n\fwoman.",
    "And nervy too.",
    "Everyone is nervy nowadays.",
    "When I was a girl people didnt\nknow what nerves were.",
    "Which reminds me that I dont like the look of George lately  I\nwonder if he could be going to have flu Ive wondered once or twice whether he was\nfeverish.",
    "But perhaps it is some business worry.",
    "He looks to me you know as though he\nhas got something on his mind.",
    "Iris shivered and Lucilla Drake exclaimed triumphantly There I said you had a chill.",
    "Chapter 2\nHow I wish that we had never ever come here.",
    "Sandra Farraday uttered the words with such unusual bitterness that her husband turned\nto look at her in surprise.",
    "It was as though his own thoughts had been put into words  the\nthoughts that he had been trying so hard to conceal.",
    "So Sandra too felt as he did She too\nhad felt that Fairhaven was spoiled its peace impaired by these new neighbours a mile\naway across the Park.",
    "He said voicing his surprise impulsively I didnt know you felt like that about them\ntoo.",
    "Immediately or so it seemed to him she withdrew into herself.",
    "Neighbours are so very important in the country.",
    "One has either to be rude or friendly\none cant as in London just keep people as amiable acquaintances.",
    "No said Stephen one cant do that.",
    "And now we are committed to this extraordinary party.",
    "They were both silent both running over in their minds the scene at lunch.",
    "George Barton\nhad been friendly even exuberant in manner with a kind of undercurrent of excitement of\nwhich they had both been conscious.",
    "George Barton was really very odd these days.",
    "Stephen had never noticed him much in the time preceding Rosemarys death.",
    "George had\njust been there in the background the kindly dull husband of a young and beautiful wife.",
    "Stephen had never even felt a pang of disquiet over the betrayal of George.",
    "George had\nbeen the kind of husband who was born to be betrayed.",
    "So much older  so devoid of the\nattractions necessary to hold an attractive and capricious woman.",
    "Had George himself\nbeen deceived Stephen did not think so.",
    "George he thought knew Rosemary very well.",
    "He\nloved her and he was the kind of man who was humble about his own powers of holding a\nwifes interest.",
    "All the same George must have suffered...\nStephen began to wonder just what George had felt when Rosemary died.",
    "He and Sandra had seen little of him in the months following the tragedy.",
    "It was not until\nhe had suddenly appeared as a near neighbour at Little Priors that he had reentered their\nlives and at once so Stephen thought he had seemed so very different.",
    "More alive more\npositive.",
    "And  yes decidedly odd.",
    "He had been odd today.",
    "That suddenly blurted out invitation.",
    "To a party for Iriss\neighteenth birthday.",
    "He did so hope Stephen and Sandra would both come.",
    "And Stephen\nand Sandra had been so kind to them down here.",
    "Sandra had said quickly of course it would be delightful.",
    "Naturally Stephen would be\nrather tied when they got back to London and she herself had a great many tiresome\nengagements but she did hope they would be able to manage it.",
    "Then lets settle a day now shall we\nGeorges face  florid smiling insistent.",
    "I thought perhaps one day the week after next \n\n\fWednesday or Thursday Thursday is November 2nd.",
    "Would that be all right But well\narrange any day that suits you both.",
    "It had been the kind of invitation that pinned you down  there was a certain lack of social\nsavoirfaire.",
    "Stephen noticed that Iris Marle had gone red and looked embarrassed.",
    "Sandra had been perfect.",
    "She had smilingly surrendered to the inevitable and said that\nThursday November 2nd would suit them very well.",
    "Suddenly voicing his thoughts Stephen said sharply We neednt go.",
    "Sandra turned her face slightly towards him.",
    "It wore a thoughtful considering air.",
    "You think not\nIts easy to make some excuse.",
    "Hell only insist on us coming some other time  or change the day.",
    "He  he seems very set\non our coming.",
    "I cant think why.",
    "Its Iriss party  and I cant believe she is so particularly anxious for\nour company.",
    "No  no  Sandra sounded thoughtful\nThen she said You know where this party is to be\nNo.",
    "The Luxembourg.",
    "The shock nearly deprived him of speech.",
    "He felt the colour ebbing out of his cheeks.",
    "He\npulled himself together and met her eyes.",
    "Was it his fancy or was there meaning in the level\ngaze\nBut its preposterous he said blustering a little in his attempt to conceal his own\npersonal emotion.",
    "The Luxembourg where  to revive all that.",
    "The man must be mad.",
    "I thought of that said Sandra.",
    "But then we shall certainly refuse to go.",
    "The  the whole thing was unpleasant.",
    "You\nremember all the publicity  and the pictures in the papers.",
    "I remember all the unpleasantness said Sandra.",
    "Doesnt he realise how disagreeable it would be for us\nHe has a reason you know Stephen.",
    "A reason that he gave me.",
    "What was it\nHe felt thankful that she was looking away from him when she spoke.",
    "He took me aside after lunch.",
    "He said he wanted to explain.",
    "He told me that the girl  Iris had never recovered properly from the shock of her sisters death.",
    "She paused and Stephen said unwillingly Well I daresay that may be true enough  she\nlooks far from well.",
    "I thought at lunch how ill she was looking.",
    "Yes I noticed it too  although she has seemed in good health and spirits on the whole\nlately.",
    "But I am telling you what George Barton said.",
    "He told me that Iris has consistently\navoided the Luxembourg ever since as far as she was able.",
    "I dont wonder.",
    "But according to him that is all wrong.",
    "It seems he consulted a nerve specialist on the\nsubject  one of these modern men  and his advice is that after a shock of any kind the\ntrouble must be faced not avoided.",
    "The principle I gather is like that of sending up an\nairman again immediately after a crash.",
    "Does the specialist suggest another suicide\nSandra replied quietly He suggests that the associations of the restaurant must be\novercome.",
    "It is after all just a restaurant.",
    "He proposed an ordinary pleasant party with as\n\n\ffar as possible the same people present.",
    "Delightful for the people\nDo you mind so much Stephen\nA swift pang of alarm shot through him.",
    "He said quickly Of course I dont mind.",
    "I just\nthought it rather a gruesome idea.",
    "Personally I shouldnt mind in the least...",
    "I was really\nthinking of you.",
    "If you dont mind \nShe interrupted him.",
    "I do mind.",
    "Very much.",
    "But the way George Barton put it made it very difficult to refuse.",
    "After all I have frequently been to the Luxembourg since  so have you.",
    "One is constantly\nbeing asked there.",
    "But not under these circumstances.",
    "No.",
    "Stephen said As you say it is difficult to refuse  and if we put it off the invitation will be\nrenewed.",
    "But theres no reason Sandra why you should have to endure it.",
    "Ill go and you\ncan cry off at the last minute  a headache chill  something of that kind.",
    "He saw her chin go up.",
    "That would be cowardly.",
    "No Stephen if you go I go.",
    "After all she laid her hand on his\narm however little our marriage means it should at least mean sharing all our\ndifficulties.",
    "But he was staring at her  rendered dumb by one poignant phrase which had escaped her\nso easily as though it voiced a long familiar and not very important fact.",
    "Recovering himself he said Why do you say that However little our marriage means\nShe looked at him steadily her eyes wide and honest.",
    "Isnt it true\nNo a thousand times no.",
    "Our marriage means everything to me.",
    "She smiled.",
    "I suppose it does  in a way.",
    "Were a good team Stephen.",
    "We pull together with a\nsatisfactory result.",
    "I didnt mean that.",
    "He found his breath was coming unevenly.",
    "He took her hand in both\nof his holding it very closely  Sandra dont you know that you mean all the world to\nme\nAnd suddenly she did know it.",
    "It was incredible  unforeseen but it was so.",
    "She was in his\narms and he was holding her close kissing her stammering out incoherent words.",
    "Sandra  Sandra  darling.",
    "I love you... Ive been so afraid  so afraid Id lose you.",
    "She heard herself saying Because of Rosemary\nYes.",
    "He let go of her stepped back his face was ludicrous in its dismay.",
    "You knew  about Rosemary\nOf course  all the time.",
    "And you understand\nShe shook her head.",
    "No I dont understand.",
    "I dont think I ever should.",
    "You loved her\nNot really.",
    "It was you I loved.",
    "A surge of bitterness swept over her.",
    "She quoted From the first moment you saw me\nacross the room Dont repeat that lie  for it was a lie\nHe was not taken aback by that sudden attack.",
    "He seemed to consider her words\nthoughtfully.",
    "Yes it was a lie  and yet in a queer way it wasnt.",
    "Im beginning to believe that it was\ntrue.",
    "Oh try and understand Sandra.",
    "You know the people who always have a noble and\ngood reason to mask their meaner actions The people who have to be honest when they\nwant to be unkind who thought it their duty to repeat so and so who are such hypocrites\nto themselves that they go through to their lifes end convinced that every mean and beastly\naction was done in a spirit of unselfishness Try and realise also that the opposite of those\npeople can exist too.",
    "People who are so cynical so distrustful of themselves and of life that\nthey can only believe in their bad motives.",
    "You were the woman I needed.",
    "That at least is\ntrue.",
    "And I do honestly believe now looking back on it that if it hadnt been true I should\nnever have gone through with it.",
    "She said bitterly You were not in love with me.",
    "No.",
    "I had never been in love.",
    "I was a starved sexless creature who prided himself  yes I\ndid  on the fastidious coldness of his nature And then I did fall in love across a room  a\nsilly violent puppy love.",
    "A thing like a midsummer thunderstorm brief unreal quickly\nover.",
    "He added bitterly Indeed a tale told by an idiot full of sound and fury signifying\nnothing.",
    "He paused and then went on It was here at Fairhaven that I woke up and realised the\ntruth.",
    "The truth\nThat the only thing in life that mattered to me was you  and keeping your love.",
    "If I had only known...\nWhat did you think\nI thought you were planning to go away with her.",
    "With Rosemary He gave a short laugh.",
    "That would have been penal servitude for\nlife\nDidnt she want you to go away with her\nYes she did.",
    "What happened\nStephen drew a deep breath.",
    "They were back again.",
    "Facing once more that intangible\nmenace.",
    "He said The Luxembourg happened.",
    "They were both silent seeing they both knew the same thing.",
    "The blue cyanosed face of a\nonce lovely woman.",
    "Staring at a dead woman and then looking up to meet each others eyes...\nStephen said Forget it Sandra for Gods sake let us forget it\nIts no use forgetting.",
    "Were not going to be allowed to forget.",
    "There was a pause.",
    "Then Sandra said What are we going to do\nWhat you said to me just now.",
    "Face things  together.",
    "Go to this horrible party whatever\nthe reason for it may be.",
    "You dont believe what George Barton said about Iris\nNo.",
    "Do you\nIt could be true.",
    "But even if it is its not the real reason.",
    "What do you think the real reason is\nI dont know Stephen.",
    "But Im afraid.",
    "Of George Barton\nYes I think he  knows.",
    "Stephen said sharply Knows what\n\n\fShe turned her head slowly until her eyes met his.",
    "She said in a whisper We mustnt be afraid.",
    "We must have courage  all the courage in\nthe world.",
    "Youre going to be a great man Stephen  a man all the world needs  and\nnothing shall interfere with that.",
    "Im your wife and I love you.",
    "What do you think this party is Sandra\nI think its a trap.",
    "He said slowly And we walk into it\nWe cant afford to show we know its a trap.",
    "No thats true.",
    "Suddenly Sandra threw back her head and laughed.",
    "She said Do your worst Rosemary.",
    "You wont win.",
    "He gripped her shoulder.",
    "Be quiet Sandra Rosemarys dead.",
    "Is she Sometimes  she feels very much alive...\nChapter 3\nHalfway across the Park Iris said\nDo you mind if I dont come back with you George I feel like a walk.",
    "I thought Id go up\nover Friars Hill and come down through the wood.",
    "Ive had an awful headache all day.",
    "My poor child.",
    "Do go.",
    "I wont come with you  Im expecting a fellow along sometime this\nafternoon and Im not quite sure when hell turn up.",
    "Right.",
    "Goodbye till teatime.",
    "She turned abruptly and made off at right angles to where a belt of larches showed on the\nhillside.",
    "When she came out on the brow of the hill she drew a deep breath.",
    "It was one of those close\nhumid days common in October.",
    "A dank moisture coated the leaves of the trees and the\ngrey cloud hung very low overhead promising yet more rain shortly.",
    "There was not really\nmuch more air up here on the hill than there had been in the valley but Iris felt\nnevertheless as though she could breathe more freely.",
    "Oh not the hatred  if true.",
    "I meant your use of the word us.",
    "My question referred to you\npersonally.",
    "Oh I see...",
    "I think they like me quite well in a negative sort of way.",
    "I think its us as a\nfamily living next door that they mind about.",
    "We werent particular friends of theirs  they\nwere Rosemarys friends.",
    "Yes said Anthony as you say they were Rosemarys friends  not that I should imagine\nSandra Farraday and Rosemary were ever bosom friends eh\nNo said Iris and she looked faintly apprehensive as Anthony smoked peacefully.",
    "Presently he said Do you know what strikes me most about the Farradays\nWhat\nJust that  that they are the Farradays.",
    "I always think of them like that  not as Stephen\nand Sandra two individuals linked by the State and the Established Church  but as a\ndefinite dual entity  the Farradays.",
    "That is rarer than you would think.",
    "They are two\npeople with a common aim a common way of life identical hopes and fears and beliefs.",
    "And the odd part of it is that they are actually very dissimilar in character.",
    "Stephen I\nshould say is a man of wide intellectual scope extremely sensitive to opinion from outside\nhorribly diffident about himself and somewhat lacking in moral courage.",
    "Sandra on the\n\n\fother hand has a narrow medieval mind is capable of fanatical devotion and is\ncourageous to the point of recklessness.",
    "He always seems to me said Iris rather pompous and stupid.",
    "Hes not at all stupid.",
    "Hes just one of the usual unhappy successes.",
    "Unhappy\nMost successes are unhappy.",
    "Thats why they are successes  they have to reassure\nthemselves about themselves by achieving something that the world will notice.",
    "What very extraordinary ideas you have Anthony.",
    "Youll find theyre quite true if you only examine them.",
    "The happy people are failures\nbecause they are on such good terms with themselves that they dont give a damn.",
    "Like me.",
    "They are also usually agreeable to get on with  again like me.",
    "You have a very good opinion of yourself.",
    "I am just drawing attention to my good points in case you maynt have noticed them.",
    "Iris laughed.",
    "Her spirits had risen.",
    "The dull depression and fear had lifted from her mind.",
    "She glanced down at her watch.",
    "Come home and have tea and give a few more people the benefit of your unusually\nagreeable society.",
    "Anthony shook his head.",
    "Not today.",
    "I must be getting back.",
    "Iris turned sharply on him.",
    "Why will you never come to the house There must be a reason.",
    "Anthony shrugged his shoulders.",
    "Put it that Im rather peculiar in my ideas of accepting hospitality.",
    "Your brotherinlaw\ndoesnt like me  hes made that quite clear.",
    "Oh dont bother about George.",
    "If Aunt Lucilla and I ask you  shes an old dear  youd\nlike her.",
    "Im sure I should  but my objection holds.",
    "You used to come in Rosemarys time.",
    "That said Anthony was different.",
    "A faint cold hand touched Iriss heart.",
    "She said What made you come down today Had\nyou business in this part of the world\nVery important business  with you.",
    "I came here to ask you a question Iris.",
    "The cold hand vanished.",
    "Instead there came a faint flutter that throb of excitement that\nwomen have known from time immemorial.",
    "And with it Iriss face adopted that same look\nof blank inquiry that her greatgrandmother might have worn prior to saying a few\nminutes later Oh Mr X this is so sudden\nYes She turned that impossibly innocent face towards Anthony.",
    "He was looking at her his eyes were grave almost stern.",
    "Answer me truthfully Iris.",
    "This is my question.",
    "Do you trust me\nIt took her aback.",
    "It was not what she had expected.",
    "He saw that.",
    "You didnt think that that was what I was going to say But it is a very important\nquestion Iris.",
    "The most important question in the world to me.",
    "I ask it again.",
    "Do you trust\nme\nShe hesitated a bare second then she answered her eyes falling Yes.",
    "Then Ill go on and ask you something else.",
    "Will you come up to London and marry me\nwithout telling anybody about it\nShe stared.",
    "But I couldnt I simply couldnt.",
    "You couldnt marry me\nNot in that way.",
    "And yet you love me.",
    "You do love me dont you\nShe heard herself saying Yes I love you Anthony.",
    "But you wont come and marry me at the Church of Saint Elfrida Bloomsbury in the\nparish of which I have resided for some weeks and where I can consequently get married\nby licence at any time\nHow can I do a thing like that George would be terribly hurt and Aunt Lucilla would\nnever forgive me.",
    "And anyway Im not of age.",
    "Im only eighteen.",
    "Youd have to lie about your age.",
    "I dont know what penalties Id incur for marrying a\nminor without her guardians consent.",
    "Who is your guardian by the way\nGeorge.",
    "Hes my trustee as well.",
    "As I was saying whatever penalties I incurred they couldnt unmarry us and that is\nreally all I care about.",
    "Iris shook her head.",
    "I couldnt do it.",
    "I couldnt be so unkind.",
    "And in any case why\nWhats the point of it\nAnthony said Thats why I asked you first if you could trust me.",
    "Youd have to take my\nreasons on trust.",
    "Lets say that it is the simplest way.",
    "But never mind.",
    "Iris said timidly If George only got to know you a little better.",
    "Come back now with me.",
    "It will be only he and Aunt Lucilla.",
    "Are you sure I thought  he paused.",
    "As I struck up the hill I saw a man going up your\ndrive  and the funny thing is that I believe I recognised him as a man I  he hesitated\nhad met.",
    "Of course  I forgot  George said he was expecting someone.",
    "The man I thought I saw was a man called Race  Colonel Race.",
    "Very likely.",
    "George knows a Colonel Race.",
    "He was coming to dinner on that night when\nRosemary  She stopped her voice quivering.",
    "Anthony gripped her hand.",
    "Dont go on remembering it darling.",
    "It was beastly I know.",
    "She shook her head.",
    "I cant help it.",
    "Anthony \nYes\nDid it ever occur to you  did you ever think  she found a difficulty in putting her\nmeaning into words.",
    "Did it ever strike you that  that Rosemary might not have committed suicide That she\nmight have been  killed\nGood God Iris what put that idea into your head\nShe did not reply  merely persisted That idea never occurred to you\nCertainly not.",
    "Of course Rosemary committed suicide.",
    "Iris said nothing.",
    "Whos been suggesting these things to you\nFor a moment she was tempted to tell him Georges incredible story but she refrained.",
    "She said slowly It was just an idea.",
    "Forget it darling idiot.",
    "He pulled her to her feet and then kissed her cheek lightly.",
    "Darling morbid idiot.",
    "Forget Rosemary.",
    "Only think of me.",
    "Chapter 4\nPuffing at his pipe Colonel Race looked speculatively at George Barton.",
    "He had known\nGeorge Barton ever since the latters boyhood.",
    "Bartons uncle had been a country\nneighbour of the Races.",
    "There was a difference of nearly twenty years between the two\nmen.",
    "Race was over sixty a tall erect military figure with sunburnt face closely cropped\nirongrey hair and shrewd dark eyes.",
    "There had never been any particular intimacy between the two men  but Barton had\nremained to Race young George  one of the many vague figures associated with earlier\ndays.",
    "He was thinking at this moment that he had really no idea what young George was like.",
    "On the brief occasions when they had met in later years they had found little in common.",
    "Race was an outdoor man essentially of the Empirebuilder type  most of his life had\nbeen spent abroad.",
    "George was emphatically the city gentleman.",
    "Their interests were\ndissimilar and when they met it was to exchange rather lukewarm reminiscences of the\nold days after which an embarrassed silence was apt to occur.",
    "Colonel Race was not good\nat small talk and might indeed have posed as the model of a strong silent man so beloved by\nan earlier generation of novelists.",
    "Silent at this moment he was wondering just why young George had been so very\ninsistent on this meeting.",
    "Thinking too that there was some subtle change in the man since\nhe had last seen him a year ago.",
    "George Barton had always struck him as stodgy  cautious\npractical unimaginative.",
    "There was he thought something very wrong with the fellow.",
    "Jumpy as a cat.",
    "Hed already\nrelit his cigar three times  and that wasnt like Barton at all.",
    "He took his pipe out of his mouth.",
    "Well young George whats the trouble\nYoure right Race it is trouble.",
    "I want your advice badly  and your help.",
    "The colonel nodded and waited.",
    "Nearly a year ago you were coming to dine with us in London  at the Luxembourg.",
    "You\nhad to go abroad at the last minute.",
    "Again Race nodded.",
    "South Africa.",
    "At the dinner party my wife died.",
    "Race stirred uncomfortably in his chair.",
    "I know.",
    "Read about it.",
    "Didnt mention it now or offer you sympathy because I didnt want\nto stir up things again.",
    "But Im sorry old man you know that.",
    "Oh yes yes.",
    "Thats not the point.",
    "My wife was supposed to have committed suicide.",
    "Race fastened on the key word.",
    "His eyebrows rose.",
    "Supposed\nRead these.",
    "He thrust the two letters into the others hand.",
    "Races eyebrows rose still higher.",
    "Anonymous letters\nYes.",
    "And I believe them.",
    "Race shook his head slowly.",
    "Thats a dangerous thing to do.",
    "Youd be surprised how many lying spiteful letters get\nwritten after any event thats been given any sort of publicity in the Press.",
    "I know that.",
    "But these werent written at the time  they werent written until six months\n\n\fafterwards.",
    "Race nodded.",
    "Thats a point.",
    "Who do you think wrote them\nI dont know.",
    "I dont care.",
    "The point is that I believe what they say is true.",
    "My wife was\nmurdered.",
    "Race laid down his pipe.",
    "He sat up a little straighter in his chair.",
    "Now just why do you think that Had you any suspicion at the time.",
    "Had the police\nI was dazed when it happened  completely bowled over.",
    "I just accepted the verdict at the\ninquest.",
    "My wife had had flu was run down.",
    "No suspicion of anything but suicide arose.",
    "The stuff was in her handbag you see.",
    "What was the stuff\nCyanide.",
    "I remember.",
    "She took it in champagne.",
    "Yes.",
    "It seemed at the time all quite straightforward.",
    "Had she ever threatened to commit suicide\nNo never.",
    "Rosemary said George Barton loved life.",
    "Race nodded.",
    "He had only met Georges wife once.",
    "He had thought her a singularly lovely\nnitwit  but certainly not a melancholic type.",
    "What about the medical evidence as to state of mind et cetera\nRosemarys own doctor  an elderly man who has attended the Marle family since they\nwere children  was away on a sea voyage.",
    "His partner a young man attended Rosemary\nwhen she had flu.",
    "All he said I remember was that the type of flu about was inclined to\nleave serious depression.",
    "George paused and went on.",
    "It wasnt until after I got these letters that I then talked with Rosemarys own doctor.",
    "I\nsaid nothing of the letters of course  just discussed what had happened.",
    "He told me then\nthat he was very surprised at what had happened.",
    "He would never have believed it he said\nRosemary was not at all a suicidal type.",
    "It showed he said how even a patient one knew\nvery well might act in a thoroughly uncharacteristic manner.",
    "Again George paused and then went on It was after talking to him I realised how\nabsolutely unconvincing to me Rosemarys suicide was.",
    "After all I knew her very well.",
    "She\nwas a person who was capable of violent fits of unhappiness.",
    "She could get very worked up\nover things and she would on occasions take very rash and unconsidered action but I have\nnever known her in the frame of mind that wanted to get out of it all.",
    "Race murmured in a slightly embarrassed manner\nCould she have had a motive for suicide apart from mere depression Was she I mean\ndefinitely unhappy about anything\nI  no  she was perhaps rather nervy.",
    "Avoiding looking at his friend Race said Was she at all a melodramatic person I only\nsaw her once you know.",
    "But there is a type that  well  might get a kick out of attempted\nsuicide  and usually if they have quarrelled with someone.",
    "The rather childish motive of Ill make them sorry\nRosemary and I hadnt quarrelled.",
    "No.",
    "And I must say that the fact of cyanide having been used rather rules that possibility\nout.",
    "Its not the kind of thing that you can monkey about with safely  and everybody\nknows it.",
    "Thats another point.",
    "If by any chance Rosemary had contemplated doing away with\nherself surely shed never do it that way Painful and  and ugly.",
    "An overdose of some\nsleeping stuff would be far more likely.",
    "I agree.",
    "Was there any evidence as to her purchasing or getting hold of the cyanide\nNo.",
    "But she had been staying with friends in the country and they had taken a wasps nest\none day.",
    "It was suggested that she might have taken a handful of potassium cyanide\ncrystals then.",
    "Yes  its not a difficult thing to get hold of.",
    "Most gardeners keep a stock of it.",
    "He paused and then said Let me summarise the position.",
    "There was no positive evidence\nas to a disposition to suicide or to any preparation for it.",
    "The whole thing was negative.",
    "But there can also have been no positive evidence pointing to murder or the police would\nhave got hold of it.",
    "Theyre quite wide awake you know.",
    "The mere idea of murder would have seemed fantastic.",
    "But it didnt seem fantastic to you six months later\nGeorge said slowly I think I must have been unsatisfied all along.",
    "And I think I must\nhave been subconsciously preparing myself so that when I saw the thing written down in\nblack and white I accepted it without doubt.",
    "Yes.",
    "Race nodded.",
    "Well then lets have it.",
    "Who do you suspect\nGeorge leaned forward  his face twitching.",
    "Thats what is so terrible.",
    "If Rosemary was killed one of those people round the table one\nof our friends must have done it.",
    "No one else came near the table.",
    "Waiters Who poured out the wine\nCharles the head waiter at the Luxembourg.",
    "You know Charles\nRace assented.",
    "Everybody knew Charles.",
    "It seemed quite impossible to imagine that\nCharles could have deliberately poisoned a client.",
    "And the waiter who looked after us was Giuseppe.",
    "We know Giuseppe well.",
    "Ive known\nhim for years.",
    "He always looks after me there.",
    "Hes a delightful cheery little fellow.",
    "So we come to the dinner party.",
    "Who was there\nStephen Farraday the M.P.",
    "His wife Lady Alexandra Farraday.",
    "My secretary Ruth\nLessing.",
    "A fellow called Anthony Browne Rosemarys sister Iris and myself.",
    "Seven in all.",
    "We should have been eight if you had come.",
    "When you dropped out we couldnt think of\nanybody suitable to ask at the last minute.",
    "I see.",
    "Well Barton who do you think did it\nGeorge cried out I dont know  I tell you I dont know.",
    "If I had any idea \nAll right  all right.",
    "I just thought you might have a definite suspicion.",
    "Well it oughtnt to\nbe difficult.",
    "How did you sit  starting with yourself\nI had Sandra Farraday on my right of course.",
    "Next to her Anthony Browne.",
    "Then\nRosemary.",
    "Then Stephen Farraday then Iris then Ruth Lessing who sat on my left.",
    "I see.",
    "And your wife had drunk champagne earlier in the evening\nYes.",
    "The glasses had been filled up several times.",
    "It  it happened while the cabaret show\nwas on.",
    "There was a lot of noise  it was one of those negro shows and we were all watching\nit.",
    "She slumped forward on the table just before the lights went up.",
    "She may have cried out\n or gasped  but nobody heard anything.",
    "The doctor said that death must have been\npractically instantaneous.",
    "Thank God for that.",
    "Yes indeed.",
    "Well Barton  on the face of it it seems fairly obvious.",
    "You mean\n\n\fStephen Farraday of course.",
    "He was on her right hand.",
    "Her champagne glass would be\nclose to his left hand.",
    "Easiest thing in the world to put the stuff in as soon as the lights were\nlowered and general attention went to the raised stage.",
    "I cant see that anybody else had\nanything like as good an opportunity.",
    "I know those Luxembourg tables.",
    "Theres plenty of\nroom round them  I doubt very much if anybody could have leaned across the table for\ninstance without being noticed even if the lights were down.",
    "The same thing applies to the\nfellow on Rosemarys left.",
    "He would have had to lean across her to put anything in her\nglass.",
    "There is one other possibility but well take the obvious person first.",
    "Any reason why\nStephen Farraday M.P.",
    "should want to do away with your wife\nGeorge said in a stifled voice They  they had been rather close friends.",
    "If  if Rosemary\nhad turned him down for instance he might have wanted revenge.",
    "Sounds highly melodramatic.",
    "That is the only motive you can suggest\nYes said George.",
    "His face was very red.",
    "Race gave him the most fleeting of glances.",
    "Then he went on Well examine possibility No.",
    "2.",
    "One of the women.",
    "Why the women\nMy dear George has it escaped your notice that in a party of seven four women and\nthree men there will probably be one or two periods during the evening when three\ncouples are dancing and one woman is sitting alone at the table You did all dance\nOh yes.",
    "Good.",
    "Now before the cabaret can you remember who was sitting alone at any moment\nGeorge thought a minute.",
    "I think  yes.",
    "Iris was odd man out last and Ruth the time before.",
    "You dont remember when your wife drank champagne last\nLet me see she had been dancing with Browne.",
    "I remember her coming back and saying\nthat had been pretty strenuous  hes rather a fancy dancer.",
    "She drank up the wine in her\nglass then.",
    "A few minutes later they played a waltz and she  danced with me.",
    "She knew a\nwaltz is the only dance Im really any good at.",
    "Farraday danced with Ruth and Lady\nAlexandra with Browne.",
    "Iris sat out.",
    "Immediately after that they had the cabaret.",
    "Then lets consider your wifes sister.",
    "Did she come into any money on your wifes death\nGeorge began to splutter.",
    "My dear Race  dont be absurd.",
    "Iris was a mere child a schoolgirl.",
    "Ive known two schoolgirls who committed murder.",
    "But Iris She was devoted to Rosemary.",
    "Never mind Barton.",
    "She also had the opportunity.",
    "I want to know if she had motive.",
    "Your wife I believe was a rich woman.",
    "Where did her money go  to you\nNo it went to Iris  a trust fund.",
    "He explained the position to which Race listened attentively.",
    "Rather a curious position.",
    "The rich sister and the poor sister.",
    "Some girls might have\nresented that.",
    "Im sure Iris never did.",
    "Maybe not  but she had a motive all right.",
    "Well try that tack now.",
    "Who else had a\nmotive\nNobody  nobody at all.",
    "Rosemary hadnt an enemy in the world Im sure.",
    "Ive been\nlooking into all that  asking questions  trying to find out.",
    "Ive even taken this house near\nthe Farradays so as to \nHe stopped.",
    "Race took up his pipe and began to scratch at its interior.",
    "Hadnt you better tell me everything young George\nWhat do you mean\nYoure keeping something back  it sticks out a mile.",
    "You can sit there defending your\nwifes reputation  or you can try and find out if she was murdered or not  but if the latter\nmatters most to you youll have to come clean.",
    "There was a silence.",
    "All right then said George in a stifled voice.",
    "You win.",
    "Youd reason to believe your wife had a lover is that it\nYes.",
    "Stephen Farraday\nI dont know I swear to you I dont know It might have been him or it might have been\nthe other fellow Browne.",
    "I couldnt make up my mind.",
    "It was hell.",
    "Now tell me what you know about this Anthony Browne Funny I seem to have heard the\nname.",
    "I dont know anything about him.",
    "Nobody does.",
    "Hes a goodlooking amusing sort of chap\n but nobody knows the first thing about him.",
    "Hes supposed to be an American but hes\ngot no accent to speak of.",
    "Oh well perhaps the Embassy will know something about him.",
    "Youve no idea  which\nNo  no I havent.",
    "Ill tell you Race.",
    "She was writing a letter  I  I examined the\nblottingpaper afterwards.",
    "It  It was a love letter all right  but there was no name.",
    "Race turned his eyes away carefully.",
    "Well that gives us a bit more to go on.",
    "Lady Alexandra for instance  she comes into it if\nher husband was having an affair with your wife.",
    "Shes the kind of woman you know who\nfeels things rather intensely.",
    "The quiet deep type.",
    "Its a type that will do murder at a pinch.",
    "Were getting on.",
    "Theres Mystery Browne and Farraday and his wife and young Iris\nMarle.",
    "What about this other woman Ruth Lessing\nRuth couldnt have had anything to do with it.",
    "She at least had no earthly motive.",
    "Your secretary you say What sort of a girl is she\nThe dearest girl in the world.",
    "George spoke with enthusiasm.",
    "Shes practically one of\nthe family.",
    "Shes my right hand  I dont know anyone I think more highly of or have more\nabsolute faith in.",
    "Youre fond of her said Race watching him thoughtfully.",
    "Im devoted to her.",
    "That girl Race is an absolute trump.",
    "I depend upon her in every way.",
    "Shes the truest dearest creature in the world.",
    "Race murmured something that sounded like Umhum and left the subject.",
    "There was\nnothing in his manner to indicate to George that he had mentally chalked down a very\ndefinite motive to the unknown Ruth Lessing.",
    "He could imagine that this dearest girl in the\nworld might have a very decided reason for wanting the removal of Mrs George Barton to\nanother world.",
    "It might be a very mercenary motive  she might also have envisaged herself\nas the second Mrs Barton.",
    "It might be that she was genuinely in love with her employer.",
    "But the motive for Rosemarys death was there.",
    "Instead he said gently I suppose it has occurred to you George that you had a pretty\ngood motive yourself.",
    "I George looked flabbergasted.",
    "Well remember Othello and Desdemona.",
    "I see what you mean.",
    "But  but it wasnt like that between me and Rosemary.",
    "I adored\n\n\fher of course but I always knew that there would be things that  that Id have to endure.",
    "Not that she wasnt fond of me  she was.",
    "She was very fond of me and sweet to me always.",
    "But of course Im a dull stick no getting away from it.",
    "Not romantic you know.",
    "Anyway\nId made up my mind when I married her that it wasnt going to be all beer and skittles.",
    "She as good as warned me.",
    "It hurt of course when it happened  but to suggest that Id\nhave touched a hair of her head \nHe stopped and then went on in a different tone\nAnyway if Id done it why on earth should I go raking it all up I mean after a verdict of\nsuicide and everything all settled and over.",
    "It would be madness.",
    "Absolutely.",
    "Thats why I dont seriously suspect you my dear fellow.",
    "If you were a\nsuccessful murderer and got a couple of letters like these youd put them quietly in the fire\nand say nothing at all about it.",
    "And that brings me to what I think is the one really\ninteresting feature of the whole thing.",
    "Who wrote those letters\nEh George looked rather startled.",
    "I havent the least idea.",
    "The point doesnt seem to have interested you.",
    "It interests me.",
    "Its the first question I\nasked you.",
    "We can assume I take it that they werent written by the murderer.",
    "Why\nshould he queer his own pitch when as you say everything had settled down and suicide\nwas universally accepted Then who wrote them Who is it who is interested in stirring the\nwhole thing up again\nServants hazarded George vaguely.",
    "Possibly.",
    "If so what servants and what do they know Did Rosemary have a confidential\nmaid\nGeorge shook his head.",
    "No.",
    "At the time we had a cook  Mrs Pound  weve still got her and a couple of maids.",
    "I\nthink theyve both left.",
    "They werent with us very long.",
    "Well Barton if you want my advice which I gather you do I should think the matter\nover very carefully.",
    "On one side theres the fact that Rosemary is dead.",
    "You cant bring her\nback to life whatever you do.",
    "If the evidence for suicide isnt particularly good neither is\nthe evidence for murder.",
    "Let us say for the sake of argument that Rosemary was\nmurdered.",
    "Do you really wish to rake up the whole thing It may mean a lot of very\nunpleasant publicity a lot of washing of dirty linen in public your wifes love affairs\nbecoming public property \nGeorge Barton winced.",
    "He said violently Do you really advise me to let some swine get\naway with it That stick Farraday with his pompous speeches and his precious career and all the time perhaps a cowardly murderer.",
    "I only want you to be clear about what it involves.",
    "I want to get at the truth.",
    "Very well.",
    "In that case I should go to the police with these letters.",
    "Theyll probably be\nable to find out fairly easily who wrote them and if the writer knows anything.",
    "Only\nremember that once youve started them on the trail you wont be able to call them off.",
    "Im not going to the police.",
    "Thats why I wanted to see you.",
    "Im going to set a trap for the\nmurderer.",
    "What on earth do you mean\nListen Race.",
    "Im going to have a party at the Luxembourg.",
    "I want you to come.",
    "The same\npeople the Farradays Anthony Browne Ruth Iris myself.",
    "Ive got it all worked out.",
    "What are you going to do\n\n\fGeorge gave a faint laugh.",
    "Thats my secret.",
    "It would spoil it if I told anyone beforehand  even you.",
    "I want you to\ncome with an unbiased mind and  see what happens.",
    "Race leant forward.",
    "His voice was suddenly sharp.",
    "I dont like it George.",
    "These melodramatic ideas out of books dont work.",
    "Go to the police\n theres no better body of men.",
    "They know how to deal with these problems.",
    "Theyre\nprofessionals.",
    "Amateur shows in crime arent advisable.",
    "Thats why I want you there.",
    "Youre not an amateur.",
    "My dear fellow.",
    "Because I once did work for M.I.5 And anyway you propose to keep me\nin the dark.",
    "Thats necessary.",
    "Race shook his head.",
    "Im sorry.",
    "I refuse.",
    "I dont like your plan and I wont be a party to it.",
    "Give it up George\ntheres a good fellow.",
    "Im not going to give it up.",
    "Ive got it all worked out.",
    "Dont be so damned obstinate.",
    "I know a bit more about these shows than you do.",
    "I dont\nlike the idea.",
    "It wont work.",
    "It may even be dangerous.",
    "Have you thought of that\nIt will be dangerous for somebody all right.",
    "Race sighed.",
    "You dont know what youre doing.",
    "Oh well dont say I havent warned you.",
    "For the last\ntime I beg you to give up this crackbrained idea of yours.",
    "George Barton only shook his head.",
    "Chapter 5\nThe morning of November 2nd had dawned wet and gloomy.",
    "It was so dark in the\ndiningroom of the house in Elvaston Square that they had to have the lights on for\nbreakfast.",
    "Iris contrary to her habit had come down instead of having her coffee and toast sent up to\nher and sat there white and ghostlike pushing uneaten food about her plate.",
    "George rustled\nhis Times with a nervy hand and at the other end of the table Lucilla Drake wept copiously\ninto a handkerchief.",
    "I know the dear boy will do something dreadful.",
    "Hes so sensitive  and he wouldnt say it\nwas a matter of life and death if it wasnt.",
    "Rustling his paper George said sharply Please dont worry Lucilla.",
    "Ive said Ill see to\nit.",
    "I know dear George you are always so kind.",
    "But I do feel any delay might be fatal.",
    "All\nthese inquiries you speak of making  they will all take time.",
    "No no well hurry them through.",
    "He says without fail by the 3rd and tomorrow is the 3rd.",
    "I should never forgive myself if\nanything happened to the darling boy.",
    "It wont.",
    "George took a long drink of coffee.",
    "And there is still that Conversion Loan of mine \nLook here Lucilla you leave it all to me.",
    "Dont worry Aunt Lucilla put in Iris.",
    "George will be able to arrange it all.",
    "After all\nthis has happened before.",
    "Not for a long time Three months said George not since the poor boy was deceived\nby those dreadful swindling friends of his on that horrid ranch.",
    "George wiped his moustache on his napkin got up patted Mrs Drake kindly on the back as\nhe made his way out of the room.",
    "Now do cheer up my dear.",
    "Ill get Ruth to cable right away.",
    "As he went out in the hall Iris followed him.",
    "George dont you think we ought to put off the party tonight Aunt Lucilla is so upset.",
    "Hadnt we better stay at home with her\nCertainly not Georges pink face went purple.",
    "Why should that damned swindling\nyoung crook upset our whole lives Its blackmail  sheer blackmail thats what it is.",
    "If I\nhad my way he shouldnt get a penny.",
    "Aunt Lucilla would never agree to that.",
    "Lucillas a fool  always has been.",
    "These women who have children when theyre over\nforty never seem to learn any sense.",
    "Spoil the brats from the cradle by giving them every\ndamned thing they want.",
    "If young Victor had once been told to get out of his mess by\nhimself it might have been the making of him.",
    "Now dont argue Iris.",
    "Ill get something\nfixed up before tonight so that Lucilla can go to bed happy.",
    "If necessary well take her\nalong with us.",
    "Oh no she hates restaurants  and gets so sleepy poor darling.",
    "And she dislikes the heat\nand the smoky air gives her asthma.",
    "I know.",
    "I wasnt serious.",
    "Go and cheer her up Iris.",
    "Tell her everything will be all right.",
    "He turned away and out of the front door.",
    "Iris turned slowly back towards the\ndiningroom.",
    "The telephone rang and she went to answer it.",
    "Hallo  who Her face changed its white hopelessness then dissolved into pleasure.",
    "Anthony\nAnthony himself.",
    "I rang you up yesterday but couldnt get you.",
    "Have you been putting in\na spot of work with George\nWhat do you mean\nWell George was so pressing over his invitation to your party tonight.",
    "Quite unlike his\nusual style of hands off my lovely ward Absolutely insistent that I should come.",
    "I thought\nperhaps it was the result of some tactful work on your part.",
    "No  no  its nothing to do with me.",
    "A change of heart all on his own\nNot exactly.",
    "Its \nHallo  have you gone away\nNo Im here.",
    "You were saying something.",
    "Whats the matter darling I can hear you sighing through\nthe telephone.",
    "Is anything the matter\nNo  nothing.",
    "I shall be all right tomorrow.",
    "Everything will be all right tomorrow.",
    "What touching faith.",
    "Dont they say tomorrow never comes\nDont \nIris  something is the matter\nNo nothing.",
    "I cant tell you.",
    "I promised you see.",
    "Tell me my sweet.",
    "No  I cant really.",
    "Anthony will you tell me something\nIf I can.",
    "Were you  ever in love with Rosemary\nA momentary pause and then a laugh.",
    "So thats it.",
    "Yes Iris I was a bit in love with Rosemary.",
    "She was very lovely you know.",
    "And then one day I was talking to her and I saw you coming down the staircase  and in a\nminute it was all over blown away.",
    "There was nobody but you in the world.",
    "Thats the cold\nsober truth.",
    "Dont brood over a thing like that.",
    "Even Romeo you know had his Rosaline\nbefore he was bowled over for good and all by Juliet.",
    "Thank you Anthony.",
    "Im glad.",
    "See you tonight.",
    "Its your birthday isnt it\nActually not for a week  its my birthday party though.",
    "You dont sound very enthusiastic about it.",
    "Im not.",
    "I suppose George knows what hes doing but it seems to me a crazy idea to have it at the\nsame place where \nOh Ive been to the Luxembourg several times since  since Rosemary  I mean one cant\navoid it.",
    "No and its just as well.",
    "Ive got a birthday present for you Iris.",
    "I hope youll like it.",
    "Au\nrevoir.",
    "He rang off.",
    "Iris went back to Lucilla Drake to argue persuade and reassure.",
    "George on his arrival at his office sent at once for Ruth Lessing.",
    "His worried frown relaxed a little as she entered calm and smiling in her neat black coat\nand skirt.",
    "Good morning.",
    "Good morning Ruth.",
    "Trouble again.",
    "Look at this.",
    "She took the cable he held out.",
    "Victor Drake again\nYes curse him.",
    "She was silent a minute holding the cable.",
    "A lean brown face wrinkling up round the nose\nwhen he laughed.",
    "A mocking voice saying the sort of girl who ought to marry the Boss...\nHow vividly it all came back.",
    "She thought It might have been yesterday...\nGeorges voice recalled her.",
    "Wasnt it about a year ago that we shipped him out there\nShe reflected.",
    "I think so yes.",
    "Actually I believe it was October 27th.",
    "What an amazing girl you are.",
    "What a memory\nShe thought to herself that she had a better reason for remembering than he knew.",
    "It was\nfresh from Victor Drakes influence that she had listened to Rosemarys careless voice over\nthe phone and decided that she hated her employers wife.",
    "I suppose were lucky said George that hes lasted as long as he has out there.",
    "Even if\nit did cost us fifty pounds three months ago.",
    "Three hundred pounds now seems a lot.",
    "Oh yes.",
    "He wont get as much as that.",
    "Well have to make the usual investigations.",
    "Id better communicate with Mr Ogilvie.",
    "Alexander Ogilvie was their agent in Buenos Aires  a sober hardheaded Scotsman.",
    "Yes.",
    "Cable at once.",
    "His mother is in a state as usual.",
    "Practically hysterical.",
    "Makes it very\ndifficult with the party tonight.",
    "Would you like me to stay with her\nNo.",
    "He negatived the idea emphatically.",
    "No indeed.",
    "Youre the one person whos got to\nbe there.",
    "I need you Ruth.",
    "He took her hand.",
    "Youre too unselfish.",
    "Im not unselfish at all.",
    "She smiled and suggested Would it be worth trying telephonic communication with Mr\nOgilvie We might get the whole thing cleared up by tonight.",
    "A good idea.",
    "Well worth the expense.",
    "Ill get busy at once.",
    "Very gently she disengaged her hand from his and went out.",
    "George dealt with various matters awaiting his attention.",
    "At halfpast twelve he went out and took a taxi to the Luxembourg.",
    "Charles the notorious and popular head waiter came towards him bending his stately\nhead and smiling in welcome.",
    "Good morning Mr Barton.",
    "Good morning Charles.",
    "Everything all right for tonight\nI think you will be satisfied sir.",
    "The same table\nThe middle one in the alcove that is right is it not\nYes  and you understand about the extra place\nIt is all arranged.",
    "And youve got the  the rosemary\nYes Mr Barton.",
    "I am afraid it wont be very decorative.",
    "You wouldnt like some red\nberries incorporated  or say a few chrysanthemums\nNo no only the rosemary.",
    "Very good sir.",
    "You would like to see the menu.",
    "Giuseppe.",
    "With a flick of the thumb Charles produced a smiling little middleaged Italian.",
    "The menu for Mr Barton.",
    "It was produced.",
    "Oysters Clear Soup Sole Luxembourg Grouse Poires Helene Chicken Livers in Bacon.",
    "George cast an indifferent eye over it.",
    "Yes yes quite all right.",
    "He handed it back.",
    "Charles accompanied him to the door.",
    "Sinking his voice a little he murmured May I just mention how appreciative we are Mr\nBarton that you are  er  coming back to us\nA smile rather a ghastly smile showed on Georges face.",
    "He said\nWeve got to forget the past  cant dwell on the past.",
    "All that is over and done with.",
    "Very true Mr Barton.",
    "You know how shocked and grieved we were at the time.",
    "Im sure I\nhope that Mademoiselle will have a very happy birthday party and that everything will be\nas you like it.",
    "Gracefully bowing Charles withdrew and darted like an angry dragonfly on some very\ninferior grade of waiter who was doing the wrong thing at a table near the window.",
    "George went out with a wry smile on his lips.",
    "He was not an imaginative enough man to feel\na pang of sympathy for the Luxembourg.",
    "It was not after all the fault of the Luxembourg that Rosemary had decided to commit\n\n\fsuicide there or that someone had decided to murder her there.",
    "It had been decidedly hard\non the Luxembourg.",
    "But like most people with an idea George thought only of that idea.",
    "He lunched at his club and went afterwards to a directors meeting.",
    "On his way back to the office he put through a phone call to a Maida Vale number from a\npublic call box.",
    "He came out with a sigh of relief.",
    "Everything was set according to schedule.",
    "He went back to the office.",
    "Ruth came to him at once.",
    "About Victor Drake.",
    "Yes\nIm afraid its rather a bad business.",
    "A possibility of criminal prosecution.",
    "Hes been\nhelping himself to the firms money over a considerable period.",
    "Did Ogilvie say so\nYes.",
    "I got through to him this morning and he got a call through to us this afternoon ten\nminutes ago.",
    "He says Victor was quite brazen about the whole thing.",
    "He would be\nBut he insists that they wont prosecute if the money is refunded.",
    "Mr Ogilvie saw the\nsenior partner and that seems to be correct.",
    "The actual sum in question is one hundred and\nsixtyfive pounds.",
    "So that Master Victor was hoping to pocket a clear hundred and thirtyfive on the\ntransaction\nIm afraid so.",
    "Well weve scotched that at any rate said George with grim satisfaction.",
    "I told Mr Ogilvie to go ahead and settle the business.",
    "Was that right\nPersonally I should be delighted to see that young crook go to prison  but one has to\nthink of his mother.",
    "A fool  but a dear soul.",
    "So Master Victor scores as usual.",
    "How good you are said Ruth.",
    "Me\nI think youre the best man in the world.",
    "He was touched.",
    "He felt pleased and embarrassed at the same time.",
    "On an impulse he\npicked up her hand and kissed it.",
    "Dearest Ruth.",
    "My dearest and best of friends.",
    "What would I have done without you\nThey stood very close together.",
    "She thought I could have been happy with him.",
    "I could have made him happy.",
    "If only \nHe thought Shall I take Races advice Shall I give it all up Wouldnt that really be the\nbest thing\nIndecision hovered over him and passed.",
    "He said 930 at the Luxembourg.",
    "Chapter 6\nThey had all come.",
    "George breathed a sigh of relief.",
    "Up to the last moment he had feared some last minute\ndefection  but they were all here.",
    "Stephen Farraday tall and stiff a little pompous in\nmanner.",
    "Sandra Farraday in a severe black velvet gown wearing emeralds round her neck.",
    "The woman had breeding not a doubt of it.",
    "Her manner was completely natural possibly a\nlittle more gracious than usual.",
    "Ruth also in black with no ornament save one jewelled clip.",
    "Her raven black hair smooth and lying close to her head her neck and arms very white \n\n\fwhiter than those of the other women.",
    "Ruth was a working girl she had no long leisured\nease in which to acquire sun tan.",
    "His eyes met hers and as though she saw the anxiety in\nhis she smiled reassurance.",
    "His heart lifted.",
    "Loyal Ruth.",
    "Beside him Iris was unusually silent.",
    "She alone showed consciousness of this being an\nunusual party.",
    "She was pale but in some way it suited her gave her a grave steadfast\nbeauty.",
    "She wore a straight simple frock of leafgreen.",
    "Anthony Browne came last and to\nGeorges mind he came with the quick stealthy step of a wild creature  a panther\nperhaps or a leopard.",
    "The fellow was not really quite civilised.",
    "They were all there  all safe in Georges trap.",
    "Now the play could begin...\nCocktails were drained.",
    "They got up and passed through the open arch into the restaurant\nproper.",
    "Dancing couples soft negro music deft hurrying waiters.",
    "Charles came forward and smilingly piloted them to their table.",
    "It was at the far end of the\nroom a shallow arched alcove which held three tables  a big one in the middle and two\nsmall ones for two people either side of it.",
    "A middleaged sallow foreigner and a blonde\nlovely were at one a slip of a boy and a girl at the other.",
    "The middle table was reserved for\nthe Barton party.",
    "George genially assigned them to their places.",
    "Sandra will you sit here on my right.",
    "Browne next to her.",
    "Iris my dear its your party.",
    "I\nmust have you here next to me and you beyond her Farraday.",
    "Then you Ruth \nHe paused  between Ruth and Anthony was a vacant chair  the table had been laid for\nseven.",
    "My friend Race may be a bit late.",
    "He said we werent to wait for him.",
    "Hell be along\nsometime.",
    "Id like you all to know him  hes a splendid fellow knocked about all over the\nworld and can tell you some good yarns.",
    "Iris was conscious of a feeling of anger as she seated herself.",
    "George had done it on purpose\n separated her from Anthony.",
    "Ruth ought to have been sitting where she was next to her\nhost.",
    "So George still disliked and mistrusted Anthony.",
    "She stole a glance across the table.",
    "Anthony was frowning.",
    "He did not look across at her.",
    "Once he directed a sharp sideways glance at the empty chair beside him.",
    "He said Glad\nyouve got another man Barton.",
    "Theres just a chance I may have to go off early.",
    "Quite\nunavoidable.",
    "But I ran into a man here I know.",
    "George said smilingly Running business into pleasure hours Youre too young for that\nBrowne.",
    "Not that Ive ever known exactly what your business is\nBy chance there was a lull in the conversation.",
    "Anthonys reply came deliberately and\ncoolly.",
    "Organised crime Barton thats what I always say when Im asked.",
    "Robberies arranged.",
    "Larcenies a feature.",
    "Families waited upon at their private addresses.",
    "Sandra Farraday laughed as she said Youre something to do with armaments arent\nyou Mr Browne An armament king is always the villain of the piece nowadays.",
    "Iris saw Anthonys eyes momentarily widen in a stare of quick surprise.",
    "He said lightly\nYou mustnt give me away Lady Alexandra its all very hush hush.",
    "The spies of a foreign\npower are everywhere.",
    "Careless talk.",
    "He shook his head with mock solemnity.",
    "The waiter took away the oyster plates.",
    "Stephen asked Iris if she would like to dance.",
    "Very soon they were all dancing.",
    "The\n\n\fatmosphere lightened.",
    "Presently Iriss turn came to dance with Anthony.",
    "She said Mean of George not to let us sit together.",
    "Kind of him.",
    "This way I can look at you all the time across the table.",
    "You wont really have to go early\nI might.",
    "Presently he said Did you know that Colonel Race was coming\nNo I hadnt the least idea.",
    "Rather odd that.",
    "Do you know him Oh yes you said so the other day.",
    "She added What sort of a man is he\nNobody quite knows.",
    "They went back to the table.",
    "The evening wore on.",
    "Slowly the tension which had relaxed\nseemed to close again.",
    "There was an atmosphere of taut nerves about the table.",
    "Only the\nhost seemed genial and unconcerned.",
    "Iris saw him glance at his watch.",
    "Suddenly there was a roll of drums  the lights went down.",
    "A stage rose in the room.",
    "Chairs\nwere pushed a little back turned sideways.",
    "Three men and three girls took the floor\ndancing.",
    "They were followed by a man who could make noises.",
    "Trains steam rollers\naeroplanes sewing machines cows coughing.",
    "He was a success.",
    "Lenny and Flo followed in\nan exhibition dance which was more of a trapeze act than a dance.",
    "More applause.",
    "Then another ensemble by the Luxembourg Six.",
    "The lights went up.",
    "Everyone blinked.",
    "At the same time a wave of sudden freedom from restraint seemed to pass over the party at\nthe table.",
    "It was as though they had been subconsciously expecting something that had\nfailed to happen.",
    "For on an earlier occasion the going up of the lights had coincided with\nthe discovery of a dead body lying across the table.",
    "It was as though now the past was\ndefinitely past  vanished into oblivion.",
    "The shadow of a bygone tragedy had lifted.",
    "Sandra turned to Anthony in an animated way.",
    "Stephen made an observation to Iris and\nRuth leaned forward to join in.",
    "Only George sat in his chair staring  staring his eyes fixed\non the empty chair opposite him.",
    "The place in front of it was laid.",
    "There was champagne in\nthe glass.",
    "At any moment someone might come might sit down there A nudge from Iris recalled him Wake up George.",
    "Come and dance.",
    "You havent danced\nwith me yet.",
    "He roused himself.",
    "Smiling at her he lifted his glass.",
    "Well drink a toast first  to the young lady whose birthday were celebrating Iris Marle\nmay her shadow never grow less\nThey drank it laughing then they all got up to dance George and Iris Stephen and Ruth\nAnthony and Sandra.",
    "It was a gay jazz melody.",
    "They all came back together laughing and talking.",
    "They sat down.",
    "Then suddenly George leaned forward.",
    "Ive something I want to ask you all.",
    "A year ago more or less we were here before on an\nevening that ended tragically.",
    "I dont want to recall past sadness but its just that I dont\nwant to feel that Rosemary is completely forgotten.",
    "Ill ask you to drink to her memory for Remembrance sake.",
    "He raised his glass.",
    "Everybody obediently raised theirs.",
    "Their faces were polite masks.",
    "George said To Rosemary for remembrance.",
    "The glasses were raised to their lips.",
    "They drank.",
    "There was a pause  then George swayed forward and slumped down in his chair his hands\nrising frenziedly to his neck his face turning purple as he fought for breath.",
    "It took him a minute and a half to die.",
    "Book III  IRIS\nFor I thought that the dead had peace\nBut it is not so...\nChapter 1\nColonel Race turned into the doorway of New Scotland Yard.",
    "He filled in the form that was\nbrought forward and a very few minutes later he was shaking hands with Chief Inspector\nKemp in the latters room.",
    "The two men were well acquainted.",
    "Kemp was slightly reminiscent of that grand old\nveteran Battle in type.",
    "Indeed since he had worked under Battle for many years he had\nperhaps unconsciously copied a good many of the older mans mannerisms.",
    "He bore about\nhim the same suggestion of being carved all in one piece  but whereas Battle had suggested\nsome wood such as teak or oak.",
    "Chief Inspector Kemp suggested a somewhat more showy\nwood  mahogany say or good oldfashioned rosewood.",
    "It was good of you to ring us colonel said Kemp.",
    "We shall want all the help we can get\non this case.",
    "It seems to have got us into exalted hands said Race.",
    "Kemp did not make modest disclaimers.",
    "He accepted quite simply the indubitable fact that\nonly cases of extreme delicacy wide publicity or supreme importance came his way.",
    "He\nsaid seriously\nIts the Kidderminster connection.",
    "You can imagine that means careful going.",
    "Race nodded.",
    "He had met Lady Alexandra Farraday several times.",
    "One of those quiet\nwomen of unassailable position whom it seems fantastic to associate with sensational\npublicity.",
    "He had heard her speak on public platforms  without eloquence but clearly and\ncompetently with a good grasp of her subject and with an excellent delivery.",
    "The kind of woman whose public life was in all the papers and whose private life was\npractically nonexistent except as a bland domestic background.",
    "Nevertheless he thought such women have a private life.",
    "They know despair and love and\nthe agonies of jealousy.",
    "They can lose control and risk life itself on a passionate gamble.",
    "He said curiously Suppose she done it Kemp\nLady Alexandra Do you think she did sir\nIve no idea.",
    "But suppose she did.",
    "Or her husband  who comes under the Kidderminster\nmantle.",
    "The steady seagreen eyes of Chief Inspector Kemp looked in an untroubled way into\nRaces dark ones.",
    "If either of them did murder well do our level best to hang him or her.",
    "You know that.",
    "Theres no fear and no favour for murderers in this country.",
    "But well have to be\n\n\fabsolutely sure of our evidence  the public prosecutor will insist on that.",
    "Race nodded.",
    "Then he said Lets have the doings.",
    "George Barton died of cyanide poisoning  same thing as his wife a year ago.",
    "You said you\nwere actually in the restaurant\nYes.",
    "Barton had asked me to join his party.",
    "I refused.",
    "I didnt like what he was doing.",
    "I\nprotested against it and urged him if he had doubts about his wifes death to go to the\nproper people  to you.",
    "Kemp nodded Thats what he ought to have done.",
    "Instead he persisted in an idea of his own  setting a trap for the murderer.",
    "He wouldnt\ntell me what that trap was.",
    "I was uneasy about the whole business  so much so that I went\nto the Luxembourg last night so as to keep an eye on things.",
    "My table necessarily was\nsome distance away  I didnt want to be spotted too obviously.",
    "Unfortunately I can tell you\nnothing.",
    "I saw nothing in the least suspicious.",
    "The waiters and his own party were the only\npeople who approached the table.",
    "Yes said Kemp it narrows it down doesnt it It was one of them or it was the waiter\nGiuseppe Balsano.",
    "Ive got him on the mat again this morning  thought you might like to\nsee him  but I cant believe he had anything to do with it.",
    "Been at the Luxembourg for\ntwelve years  good reputation married three children good record behind him.",
    "Gets on\nwell with all the clients.",
    "Which leaves us with the guests.",
    "Yes.",
    "The same party as was present when Mrs Barton died.",
    "What about that business Kemp\nIve been going into it since it seems pretty obvious that the two hang together.",
    "Adams\nhandled it.",
    "It wasnt what we call a clear case of suicide but suicide was the most probable\nsolution and in the absence of any direct evidence suggesting murder one had to let it go as\nsuicide.",
    "Couldnt do anything else.",
    "Weve a good many cases like that in our records as you\nknow.",
    "Suicide with a query mark.",
    "The public doesnt know about the query mark  but we\nkeep it in mind.",
    "Sometimes we go on quite a bit hunting about quietly.",
    "Sometimes something crops up  sometimes it doesnt.",
    "In this case it didnt.",
    "Until now.",
    "Until now.",
    "Somebody tipped Mr Barton off to the fact that his wife had been murdered.",
    "He got busy on his own  he as good as announced that he was on the right track  whether\nhe was or not I dont know  but the murderer must have thought so  so the murderer gets\nrattled and bumps off Mr Barton.",
    "That seems the way of it as far as I can see  I hope you\nagree\nOh yes  that part of it seems straightforward enough.",
    "God knows what the trap was  I\nnoticed that there was an empty chair at the table.",
    "Perhaps it was waiting for some\nunexpected witness.",
    "Anyhow it accomplished rather more than it was meant to do.",
    "It\nalarmed the guilty person so much that he or she didnt wait for the trap to be sprung.",
    "Well said Kemp weve got five suspects.",
    "And weve got the first case to go on  Mrs\nBarton.",
    "Youre definitely of the opinion now that it was not suicide\nThis murder seems to prove that it wasnt.",
    "Though I dont think you can blame us at the\ntime for accepting the suicide theory as the most probable.",
    "There was some evidence for\nit.",
    "Depression after influenza\nKemps wooden face showed a ripple of a smile.",
    "That was for the coroners court.",
    "Agreed with the medical evidence and saved\neverybodys feelings.",
    "Thats done every day.",
    "And there was a halffinished letter to the\nsister directing how her personal belongings were to be given away  showed shed had the\nidea of doing away with herself in her mind.",
    "She was depressed all right I dont doubt\npoor lady  but nine times out of ten with women its a love affair.",
    "With men its mostly\nmoney worries.",
    "So you knew Mrs Barton had a love affair.",
    "Yes we soon found that out.",
    "It had been discreet  but it didnt take much finding.",
    "Stephen Farraday\nYes.",
    "They used to meet in a little flat out Earls Court way.",
    "It had been going on for over\nsix months.",
    "Say theyd had a quarrel  or possibly he was getting tired of her  well she\nwouldnt be the first woman to take her life in a fit of desperation.",
    "By potassium cyanide in a public restaurant\nYes  if she wanted to be dramatic about it  with him looking on and all.",
    "Some people\nhave a feeling for the spectacular.",
    "From what I could find out she hadnt much feeling for\nthe conventions  all the precautions were on his side.",
    "Any evidence as to whether his wife knew what was going on\nAs far as we could learn she knew nothing about it.",
    "She may have for all that Kemp.",
    "Not the kind of woman to wear her heart on her\nsleeve.",
    "Oh quite so.",
    "Count them both in as possibles.",
    "She for jealousy.",
    "He for his career.",
    "Divorce\nwould have dished that.",
    "Not that divorce means as much as it used to but in his case it\nwould have meant the antagonism of the Kidderminster clan.",
    "What about the secretary girl\nShes a possible.",
    "Might have been sweet on George Barton.",
    "They were pretty thick at the\noffice and theres an idea there that she was keen on him.",
    "Actually yesterday afternoon one\nof the telephone girls was giving an imitation of Barton holding Ruth Lessings hand and\nsaying he couldnt do without her and Miss Lessing came out and caught them and sacked\nthe girl there and then  gave her a months money and told her to go.",
    "Looks as though she\nwas sensitive about it all.",
    "Then the sister came into a peck of money  ones got to\nremember that.",
    "Looked a nice kid but you can never tell.",
    "And there was Mrs Bartons\nother boy friend.",
    "Im rather anxious to hear what you know about him\nKemp said slowly Remarkably little  but what there is isnt too good.",
    "His passports in\norder.",
    "Hes an American citizen about whom we cant find out anything detrimental or\notherwise.",
    "He came over here stayed at Claridges and managed to strike up an\nacquaintance with Lord Dewsbury.",
    "Confidence man\nMight be.",
    "Dewsbury seems to have fallen for him  asked him to stay.",
    "Rather a critical\ntime just then.",
    "Armaments said Race.",
    "There was that trouble about the new tank trials in Dewsburys\nworks.",
    "Yes.",
    "This fellow Browne represented himself as interested in armaments.",
    "It was soon after\nhed been up there that they discovered that sabotage business  just in the nick of time.",
    "Browne met a good many cronies of Dewsbury  he seems to have cultivated all the ones\nwho were connected with the armament firms.",
    "As a result hes been shown a lot of stuff\nthat in my opinion he ought never to have seen  and in one or two cases theres been\nserious trouble in the works not long after hes been in the neighbourhood.",
    "An interesting person Mr Anthony Browne\nYes.",
    "Hes got a lot of charm apparently and plays it for all hes worth.",
    "And where did Mrs Barton come in George Barton hasnt anything to do with the\narmament world\nNo.",
    "But they seem to have been fairly intimate.",
    "He may have let out something to her.",
    "You\nknow colonel none better what a pretty woman can get out of a man.",
    "Race nodded taking the Chief Inspectors words as meant to refer to the\nCounterEspionage Department which he had once controlled and not as some ignorant\nperson might have thought  to some personal indiscretions of his own.",
    "He said after a minute or two Have you had a go at those letters that George Barton\nreceived\nYes.",
    "Found them in his desk at his house last night.",
    "Miss Marle found them for me.",
    "You know Im interested in those letters Kemp.",
    "Whats the expert opinion on them\nCheap paper ordinary ink  fingerprints show George Barton and Iris Marle handled\nthem  and a horde of unidentified dabs on the envelope postal employees etc.",
    "They were\nprinted and the experts say by someone of good education in normal health.",
    "Good education.",
    "Not a servant\nPresumably not.",
    "That makes it more interesting still.",
    "It means that somebody else had suspicions at least.",
    "Someone who didnt go to the police.",
    "Someone who was prepared to arouse Georges\nsuspicions but who didnt follow the business up.",
    "Theres something odd there Kemp.",
    "He\ncouldnt have written them himself could he\nHe could have.",
    "But why\nAs a preliminary to suicide  a suicide which he intended to look like murder.",
    "With Stephen Farraday booked for the hangmans rope Its an idea  but hed have made\nquite sure that everything pointed to Farraday as the murderer.",
    "As it is weve nothing\nagainst Farraday at all.",
    "What about cyanide Was there any container found\nYes.",
    "A small white paper packet under the table.",
    "Traces of cyanide crystals inside.",
    "No\nfingerprints on it.",
    "In a detective story of course it would be some special kind of paper or\nfolded in some special way.",
    "Id like to give these detective story writers a course of routine\nwork.",
    "Theyd soon learn how most things are untraceable and nobody ever notices\nanything anywhere\nRace smiled.",
    "Almost too sweeping a statement.",
    "Did anybody notice anything last night\nActually thats what Im starting on today.",
    "I took a brief statement from everyone last\nnight and I went back to Elvaston Square with Miss Marle and had a look through\nBartons desk and papers.",
    "I shall get fuller statements from them all today  also statements\nfrom the people sitting at the other two tables in the alcoves  He rustled through some\npapers  Yes here they are.",
    "Gerald Tollington Grenadier Guards and the Hon.",
    "Patricia\nBriceWoodworth.",
    "Young engaged couple.",
    "Ill bet they didnt see anything but each other.",
    "And Mr Pedro Morales  nasty bit of goods from Mexico  even the whites of his eyes are\nyellow  and Miss Christine Shannon  a golddigging blonde lovely  Ill bet she didnt see\nanything  dumber than youd believe possible except where money is concerned.",
    "Its a\nhundred to one chance that any of them saw anything but I took their names and\naddresses on the off chance.",
    "Well start off with the waiter chap Giuseppe.",
    "Hes here now.",
    "Ill have him sent in.",
    "Chapter 2\nGiuseppe Balsano was a middleaged man slight with a rather monkeylike intelligent face.",
    "He was nervous but not unduly so.",
    "His English was fluent since he had he explained been\nin the country since he was sixteen and had married an English wife.",
    "Kemp treated him sympathetically.",
    "Now then Giuseppe lets hear whether anything more has occurred to you about this.",
    "It is for me very unpleasant.",
    "It is I who serve that table.",
    "I who pour out the wine.",
    "People\nwill say that I am off my head that I put poison into the wine glasses.",
    "It is not so but that is\nwhat people will say.",
    "Already Mr Goldstein says it is better that I take a week away from\nwork  so that people do not ask me questions there and point me out.",
    "He is a fair man and\njust and he knows it is not my fault and that I have been there for many years so he does\nnot dismiss me as some restaurant owners would do.",
    "M. Charles too he has been kind but\nall the same it is a great misfortune for me  and it makes me afraid.",
    "Have I an enemy I ask\nmyself\nWell said Kemp at his most wooden have you\nThe sad monkeyface twitched into laughter.",
    "Giuseppe stretched out his arms.",
    "I I have not an enemy in the world.",
    "Many good friends but no enemies.",
    "Kemp grunted.",
    "Now about last night.",
    "Tell me about the champagne.",
    "It was Clicquot 1928  very good and expensive wine.",
    "Mr Barton was like that  he liked\ngood food and drink  the best.",
    "Had he ordered the wine beforehand\nYes.",
    "He had arranged everything with Charles.",
    "What about the vacant place at the table\nThat too he had arranged for.",
    "He told Charles and he told me.",
    "A young lady would\noccupy it later in the evening.",
    "A young lady Race and Kemp looked at each other.",
    "Do you know who the young lady\nwas\nGiuseppe shook his head.",
    "No I know nothing about that.",
    "She was to come later that is all I heard.",
    "Go on about the wine.",
    "How many bottles\nTwo bottles and a third to be ready if needed.",
    "The first bottle was finished quite quickly.",
    "The second I open not long before the cabaret.",
    "I fill up the glasses and put the bottle in the\nice bucket.",
    "When did you last notice Mr Barton drinking from his glass\nLet me see when the cabaret was over they drink the young ladys health.",
    "It is her\nbirthday so I understand.",
    "Then they go and dance.",
    "It is after that when they come back\nthat Mr Barton drinks and in a minute like that he is dead.",
    "Had you filled up the glasses during the time they were dancing\nNo monsieur.",
    "They were full when they drank to mademoiselle and they did not drink\nmuch only a few mouthfuls.",
    "There was plenty left in the glasses.",
    "Did anyone  anyone at all  come near the table whilst they were dancing\nNo one at all sir.",
    "I am sure of that.",
    "Did they all go to dance at the same time\nYes.",
    "And came back at the same time\nGiuseppe screwed up his eyes in an effort of memory.",
    "Mr Barton he came back first  with the young lady.",
    "He was stouter than the rest  he did\nnot dance quite so long you comprehend.",
    "Then came the fair gentleman Mr Farraday and\nthe young lady in black.",
    "Lady Alexandra Farraday and the dark gentleman came last.",
    "You know Mr Farraday and Lady Alexandra\nYes sir.",
    "I have seen them in the Luxembourg often.",
    "They are very distinguished.",
    "Now Giuseppe would you have seen if one of those people had put something in Mr\nBartons glass\nThat I cannot say sir.",
    "I have my service the other two tables in the alcove and two more\nin the main restaurant.",
    "There are dishes to serve.",
    "I do not watch at Mr Bartons table.",
    "After the cabaret everyone nearly gets up and dances so at that time I am standing still and that is why I can be sure that no one approached the table then.",
    "But as soon as people\nsit down I am at once very busy.",
    "Kemp nodded.",
    "But I think Giuseppe continued that it would be very difficult to do without being\nobserved.",
    "It seems to me that only Mr Barton himself could do it.",
    "But you do not think so\nno\nHe looked inquiringly at the police officer.",
    "So thats your idea is it\nNaturally I know nothing  but I wonder.",
    "Just a year ago that beautiful lady Mrs Barton\nshe kills herself.",
    "Could it not be that Mr Barton he grieves so much that he too decides to\nkill himself the same way It would be poetic.",
    "Of course it is not good for the restaurant but a gentleman who is going to kill himself would not think of that.",
    "He looked eagerly from one to the other of the two men.",
    "Kemp shook his head.",
    "I doubt if its as easy as that he said.",
    "He asked a few more questions then Giuseppe was\ndismissed.",
    "As the door closed behind Giuseppe\nRace said I wonder if thats what we are meant to think\nGrieving husband kills himself on anniversary of wifes death Not that it was the\nanniversary  but near enough.",
    "It was All Souls Day said Race.",
    "True.",
    "Yes its possible that was the idea  but if so whoever it was cant have known\nabout those letters being kept and that Mr Barton had consulted you and shown them to\nIris Marle.",
    "He glanced at his watch.",
    "Im due at Kidderminster House at 1230.",
    "Weve time before that to go and see those\npeople at the other two tables  some of them at any rate.",
    "Come with me wont you\n\n\fcolonel\nChapter 3\nMr Morales was staying at the Ritz.",
    "He was hardly a pretty sight at this hour in the\nmorning still unshaven the whites of his eyes bloodshot and with every sign of a severe\nhangover.",
    "Mr Morales was an American subject and spoke a variant of the American language.",
    "Though professing himself willing to remember anything he could his recollections of the\nprevious evening were of the vaguest description.",
    "Went with Chrissie  that baby is sure hardboiled She said it was a good joint.",
    "Honey\npie I said well go just where you say.",
    "It was a classy joint that Ill admit  and do they\nknow how to charge you Set me back the best part of thirty dollars.",
    "But the band was\npunk  they just couldnt seem to swing it.",
    "Diverted from his recollections of his own evening Mr Morales was pressed to remember\nthe table in the middle of the alcove.",
    "Here he was not very helpful.",
    "Sure there was a table and some people at it.",
    "I dont remember what they looked like\nthough.",
    "Didnt take much account of them till the guy there croaked.",
    "Thought at first he\ncouldnt hold his liquor.",
    "Say now I remember one of the dames.",
    "Dark hair and she had\nwhat it takes I should say.",
    "You mean the girl in the green velvet dress\nNo not that one.",
    "She was skinny.",
    "This baby was in black with some good curves.",
    "It was Ruth Lessing who had taken Mr Morales roving eye.",
    "He wrinkled up his nose appreciatively.",
    "I watched her dancing  and say could that baby dance I gave her the high sign once or\ntwice but she had a frozen eye  just looked through me in your British way.",
    "Nothing more of value could be extracted from Mr Morales and he admitted frankly that\nhis alcoholic condition was already well advanced by the time the cabaret was on.",
    "Kemp\nthanked him and prepared to take his leave.",
    "Im sailing for New York tomorrow said Morales.",
    "You wouldnt he asked wistfully\ncare for me to stay on\nThank you but I dont think your evidence will be needed at the inquest.",
    "You see Im enjoying it right here  and if it was police business the firm couldnt kick.",
    "When the police tell you to stay put youve got to stay put.",
    "Maybe I could remember\nsomething if I thought hard enough\nBut Kemp declined to rise to this wistful bait and he and Race drove to Brook Street where\nthey were greeted by a choleric gentleman the father of the Hon.",
    "Patricia\nBriceWoodworth.",
    "General Lord Woodworth received them with a good deal of outspoken comment.",
    "What on earth was the idea of suggesting that his daughter  his daughter  was mixed up\nin this sort of thing If a girl couldnt go out with her fianc\u00e9 to dine in a restaurant without\nbeing subjected to annoyance by detectives and Scotland Yard what was England coming\nto She didnt even know these people what was their name  Hubbard  Barton Some\nCity fellow or other Showed you couldnt be too careful where you went  Luxembourg\nwas always supposed to be all right  but apparently this was the second time a thing of this\nsort had happened there.",
    "Gerald must be a fool to have taken Pat there  these young men\n\n\fthought they knew everything.",
    "But in any case he wasnt going to have his daughter\nbadgered and bullied and crossquestioned  not without a solicitors say so.",
    "Hed ring up\nold Anderson in Lincolns Inn and ask him Here the general paused abruptly and staring at Race said Seen you somewhere.",
    "Now\nwhere \nRaces answer was immediate and came with a smile.",
    "Badderpore 1923.",
    "By Jove said the general.",
    "If it isnt Johnnie Race What are you doing mixed up in this\nshow\nRace smiled.",
    "I was with Chief Inspector Kemp when the question of interviewing your daughter came\nup.",
    "I suggested it would be much pleasanter for her if Inspector Kemp came round here\nthan if she had to come down to Scotland Yard and I thought Id come along too.",
    "Oh  er  well very decent of you Race.",
    "We naturally wanted to upset the young lady as little as possible put in Chief Inspector\nKemp.",
    "But at this moment the door opened and Miss Patricia BriceWoodworth walked in and\ntook charge of the situation with the coolness and detachment of the very young.",
    "Hallo she said.",
    "Youre from Scotland Yard arent you About last night Ive been\nlonging for you to come.",
    "Is father being tiresome Now dont daddy  you know what the\ndoctor said about your blood pressure.",
    "Why you want to get into such states about\neverything I cant think.",
    "Ill just take the inspectors or superintendents or whatever they\nare into my room and Ill send Walters to you with a whisky and soda.",
    "The general had a choleric desire to express himself in several blistering ways at once but\nonly succeeded in saying Old friend of mine.",
    "Major Race at which introduction\nPatricia lost interest in Race and bent a beatific smile on Chief Inspector Kemp.",
    "With cool\ngeneralship she shepherded them out of the room and into her own sittingroom firmly\nshutting her father in his study.",
    "Poor daddy she observed.",
    "He will fuss.",
    "But hes quite easy to manage really.",
    "The conversation then proceeded on most amicable lines but with very little result.",
    "Its maddening really said Patricia.",
    "Probably the only chance in my life that I shall\never have of being right on the spot when a murder was done  it is a murder isnt it The\npapers were very cautious and vague but I said to Gerry on the telephone that it must be\nmurder.",
    "Think of it  a murder done right close by me and I wasnt even looking\nThe regret in her voice was unmistakable.",
    "It was evident enough that as the Chief Inspector had gloomily prognosticated the two\nyoung people who had got engaged only a week previously had had eyes only for each\nother.",
    "With the best will in the world a few personalities were all that Patricia BriceWoodworth\ncould muster.",
    "Sandra Farraday was looking very smart but then she always does.",
    "That was a\nSchiaparelli model she had on.",
    "You know her Race asked.",
    "Patricia shook her head.",
    "Only by sight.",
    "He looks rather a bore I always think.",
    "So pompous like most politicians.",
    "Did you know any of the others by sight\n\n\fShe shook her head.",
    "No Id never seen any of them before  at least I dont think so.",
    "In fact I dont suppose I\nwould have noticed Sandra Farraday if it hadnt been for the Schiaparelli.",
    "And youll find said Chief Inspector Kemp grimly as they left the house that Master\nTollington will be exactly the same  only there wont have been even a Skipper  skipper\nwhat  sounds like a sardine  to attract his attention.",
    "I dont suppose agreed Race that the cut of Stephen Farradays dress suit will have\ncaused him any heart pangs.",
    "Oh well said the inspector.",
    "Lets try Christine Shannon.",
    "Then well have finished with\nthe outside chances.",
    "Miss Shannon was as Chief Inspector Kemp had stated a blonde lovely.",
    "The bleached\nhair carefully arranged swept back from a soft vacant babylike countenance.",
    "Miss Shannon might be as Inspector Kemp had affirmed dumb  but she was eminently\neasy to look at and a certain shrewdness in the large babyblue eyes indicated that her\ndumbness only extended in intellectual directions and that where horse sense and a\nknowledge of finance were indicated Christine Shannon was right on the spot.",
    "She received the two men with the utmost sweetness pressing drinks upon them and when\nthese were refused urging cigarettes.",
    "Her flat was small and cheaply modernistic.",
    "Id just love to be able to help you Chief Inspector.",
    "Do ask me any question you like.",
    "Kemp led off with a few conventional questions about the bearing and demeanour of the\nparty at the centre table.",
    "At once Christine showed herself to be an unusually keen and shrewd observer.",
    "The party wasnt going well  you could see that.",
    "Stiff as stiff could be.",
    "I felt quite sorry\nfor the old boy  the one who was giving it.",
    "Going all out he was to try and make things go and just as nervous as a cat on wires  but all he could do didnt seem to cut any ice.",
    "The\ntall woman hed got on his right was as stiff as though shed swallowed the poker and the\nkid on his left was just mad you could see because she wasnt sitting next to the\nnicelooking dark boy opposite.",
    "As for the tall fair fellow next to her he looked as though\nhis tummy was out of order ate his food as though he thought it would choke him.",
    "The\nwoman next to him was doing her best she pegged away at him but she looked rather as\nthough she had the jumps herself.",
    "You seem to have been able to notice a great deal Miss Shannon said Colonel Race.",
    "Ill let you into a secret.",
    "I wasnt being so much amused myself.",
    "Id been out with that boy\nfriend of mine three nights running and was I getting tired of him He was all out for\nseeing London  especially what he called the classy spots  and I will say for him he wasnt\nmean.",
    "Champagne every time.",
    "We went to the Compradour and the Mille Fleurs and\nfinally the Luxembourg and Ill say he enjoyed himself.",
    "In a way it was kind of pathetic.",
    "But his conversation wasnt what youd call interesting.",
    "Just long histories of business deals\nhed put through in Mexico and most of those I heard three times  and going on to all the\ndames hed known and how mad they were about him.",
    "A girl gets kind of tired of listening\nafter a while and youll admit that Pedro is nothing much to look at  so I just concentrated\non the eats and let my eyes roam round.",
    "Well thats excellent from our point of view Miss Shannon said the Chief Inspector.",
    "And I can only hope that you will have seen something that may help us solve our\nproblem.",
    "Christine shook her blonde head.",
    "Ive no idea who bumped the old boy off  no idea at all.",
    "He just took a drink of\nchampagne went purple in the face and sort of collapsed.",
    "Do you remember when he had last drunk from his glass before that\nThe girl reflected.",
    "Why  yes  it was just after the cabaret.",
    "The lights went up and he picked up his glass and\nsaid something and the others did it too.",
    "Seemed to me it was a toast of some kind.",
    "The Chief Inspector nodded.",
    "And then\nThen the music began and they all got up and went off to dance pushing their chairs back\nand laughing.",
    "Seemed to get warmed up for the first time.",
    "Wonderful what champagne will\ndo for the stickiest parties.",
    "They all went together  leaving the table empty\nYes.",
    "And no one touched Mr Bartons glass.",
    "No one at all.",
    "Her reply came promptly.",
    "Im perfectly certain of that.",
    "And no one  no one at all came near the table while they were away.",
    "No one  except the waiter of course.",
    "A waiter Which waiter\nOne of the halffledged ones with an apron round about sixteen.",
    "Not the real waiter.",
    "He\nwas an obliging little fellow rather like a monkey  Italian I guess he was.",
    "Chief Inspector Kemp acknowledged this description of Giuseppe Balsano with a nod of\nthe head.",
    "And what did he do this young waiter He filled up the glasses\nChristine shook her head.",
    "Oh no.",
    "He didnt touch anything on the table.",
    "He just picked up an evening bag that one\nof the girls had dropped when they all got up.",
    "Whose bag was it\nChristine took a minute or two to think.",
    "Then she said Thats right.",
    "It was the kids bag  a green and gold thing.",
    "The other two\nwomen had black bags.",
    "What did the waiter do with the bag\nChristine looked surprised.",
    "He just put it back on the table thats all.",
    "Youre quite sure he didnt touch any of the glasses\nOh no.",
    "He just dropped the bag down very quick and ran off because one of the real\nwaiters was hissing at him to go somewhere or get something and everything was going to\nbe his fault\nAnd thats the only time anyone went near that table\nThats right.",
    "But of course someone might have gone to the table without your noticing\nBut Christine shook her head very determinedly.",
    "No Im quite sure they didnt.",
    "You see Pedro had been called to the telephone and hadnt\ngot back yet so I had nothing to do but look around and feel bored.",
    "Im pretty good at\nnoticing things and from where I was sitting there wasnt much else to see but the empty\ntable next to us.",
    "Race asked Who came back first to the table\n\n\fThe girl in green and the old boy.",
    "They sat down and then the fair man and the girl in\nblack came back and after them the haughty piece of goods and the goodlooking dark boy.",
    "Some dancer he was.",
    "When they were all back and the waiter was warming up a dish like\nmad on the spirit lamp the old boy leaned forward and made a kind of speech and then\nthey all picked up their glasses again.",
    "And then it happened.",
    "Christine paused and added brightly\nAwful wasnt it Of course I thought it was a stroke.",
    "My aunt had a stroke and she went\ndown just like that.",
    "Pedro came back just then and I said Look Pedro that mans had a\nstroke.",
    "And all Pedro would say was Just passing out  just passing out  thats all which\nwas about what he was doing.",
    "I had to keep my eye on him.",
    "They dont like you passing out\nat a place like the Luxembourg.",
    "Thats why I dont like Dagoes.",
    "When theyve drunk too\nmuch theyre not a bit refined any more  a girl never knows what unpleasantness she may\nbe let in for.",
    "She brooded for a moment and then glancing at a showy looking bracelet on her right\nwrist she added Still I must say theyre generous enough.",
    "Gently distracting her from the trials and compensations of a girls existence Kemp took\nher through her story once more.",
    "Thats our last chance of outside help gone he said to Race when they had left Miss\nShannons flat.",
    "And it would have been a good chance if it had come off.",
    "That girls the\nright kind of witness.",
    "Sees things and remembers them accurately.",
    "If there had been\nanything to see shed have seen it.",
    "So the answer is that there wasnt anything to see.",
    "Its\nincredible.",
    "Its a conjuring trick George Barton drinks champagne and goes and dances.",
    "He comes back drinks from the same glass that no one has touched and Hey Presto its full\nof cyanide.",
    "Its crazy  I tell you  it couldnt have happened except that it did.",
    "He stopped a minute.",
    "That waiter.",
    "The little boy.",
    "Giuseppe never mentioned him.",
    "I might look into that.",
    "After\nall hes the one person who was near the table whilst they were all away dancing.",
    "There\nmight be something in it.",
    "Race shook his head.",
    "If hed put anything in Bartons glass that girl would have seen him.",
    "Shes a born\nobserver of detail.",
    "Nothing to think about inside her head and so she uses her eyes.",
    "No\nKemp there must be some quite simple explanation if only we could get it.",
    "Yes theres one.",
    "He dropped it in himself.",
    "Im beginning to believe that that is what happened  that its the only thing that can have\nhappened.",
    "But if so Kemp Im convinced he didnt know it was cyanide.",
    "You mean someone gave it to him Told him it was for indigestion or blood pressure something like that\nIt could be.",
    "Then who was the someone Not either of the Farradays.",
    "That would certainly seem unlikely.",
    "And Id say Mr Anthony Browne is equally unlikely.",
    "That leaves us two people  and\naffectionate sisterinlaw \nAnd a devoted secretary.",
    "Kemp looked at him.",
    "Yes  she could have planted something of the kind on him  Im due now to go to\nKidderminster House  What about you Going round to see Miss Marle\n\n\fI think Ill go and see the other one  at the office.",
    "Condolences of an old friend.",
    "I might\ntake her out to lunch.",
    "So that is what you think.",
    "I dont think anything yet.",
    "Im casting about for spoor.",
    "You ought to see Iris Marle all the same.",
    "Im going to see her  but Id rather go to the house first when she isnt there.",
    "Do you\nknow why Kemp\nIm sure I couldnt say.",
    "Because theres someone there who twitters  twitters like a little bird... A little bird told\nme  was a saying of my youth.",
    "Its very true Kemp  these twitterers can tell one a lot if\none just lets them  twitter\nChapter 4\nThe two men parted.",
    "Race halted a taxi and was driven to George Bartons office in the\ncity.",
    "Chief Inspector Kemp mindful of his expense account took a bus to within a stones\nthrow of Kidderminster House.",
    "The inspectors face was rather grim as he mounted the steps and pushed the bell.",
    "He was\nhe knew on difficult ground.",
    "The Kidderminster faction had immense political influence\nand its ramifications spread out like a network throughout the country.",
    "Chief Inspector\nKemp had full belief in the impartiality of British justice.",
    "If Stephen or Alexandra\nFarraday had been concerned in the death of Rosemary Barton or in that of George Barton\nno pull or influence would enable them to escape the consequences.",
    "But if they were guiltless or the evidence against them was too vague to ensure conviction\nthen the responsible officer must be careful how he trod or he would be liable to get a rap\nover the knuckles from his superiors.",
    "In these circumstances it can be understood that the\nChief Inspector did not much relish what lay before him.",
    "It seemed to him highly probable\nthat the Kidderminsters would as he phrased it to himself cut up rough.",
    "Kemp soon found however that he had been somewhat na\u00efve in his assumption.",
    "Lord\nKidderminster was far too experienced a diplomat to resort to crudities.",
    "On stating his business.",
    "Chief Inspector Kemp was taken at once by a pontifical butler to a\ndim booklined room at the back of the house where he found Lord Kidderminster and his\ndaughter and soninlaw awaiting him.",
    "Coming forward Lord Kidderminster shook hands and said courteously\nYou are exactly on time Chief Inspector.",
    "May I say that I much appreciate your courtesy\nin coming here instead of demanding that my daughter and her husband should come to\nScotland Yard which of course they would have been quite prepared to do if necessary that goes without saying  but they appreciate your kindness.",
    "Sandra said in a quiet voice Yes indeed Inspector.",
    "She was wearing a dress of some soft dark red material and sitting as she was with the\nlight from the long narrow window behind her she reminded Kemp of a stained glass\nfigure he had once seen in a cathedral abroad.",
    "The long oval of her face and the slight angularity of her shoulders helped the illusion.",
    "Saint Somebody or other they had told him  but Lady Alexandra Farraday was no saint not by a long way.",
    "And yet some of these old saints had been funny people from his point of\nview not kindly ordinary decent Christian folk but intolerant fanatical cruel to\n\n\fthemselves and others.",
    "Stephen Farraday stood close by his wife.",
    "His face expressed no emotion whatever.",
    "He\nlooked correct and formal an appointed legislator of the people.",
    "The natural man was well\nburied.",
    "But the natural man was there as the Chief Inspector knew.",
    "Lord Kidderminster was speaking directing with a good deal of ability the trend of the\ninterview.",
    "I wont disguise from you Chief Inspector that this is a very painful and disagreeable\nbusiness for us all.",
    "This is the second time that my daughter and soninlaw have been\nconnected with a violent death in a public place  the same restaurant and two members of\nthe same family.",
    "Publicity of such a kind is always harmful to a man in the public eye.",
    "Publicity of course cannot be avoided.",
    "We all realise that and both my daughter and Mr\nFaraday are anxious to give you all the help they can in the hope that the matter may be\ncleared up speedily and public interest in it die down.",
    "Thank you Lord Kidderminster.",
    "I much appreciate the attitude you have taken up.",
    "It\ncertainly makes things easier for us.",
    "Sandra Farraday said Please ask us any questions you like Chief Inspector.",
    "Thank you Lady Alexandra.",
    "Just one point Chief Inspector said Lord Kidderminster.",
    "You have of course your\nown sources of information and I gather from my friend the Commissioner that this man\nBartons death is regarded as murder rather than suicide though on the face of it to the\noutside public suicide would seem a more likely explanation.",
    "You thought it was suicide\ndidnt you Sandra my dear\nThe Gothic figure bowed its head slightly.",
    "Sandra said in a thoughtful voice It seemed to me so obvious last night.",
    "We were there in\nthe same restaurant and actually at the same table where poor Rosemary Barton poisoned\nherself last year.",
    "We have seen something of Mr Barton during the summer in the country\nand he has really been very odd  quite unlike himself  and we all thought that his wifes\ndeath was preying on his mind.",
    "He was very fond of her you know and I dont think he\never got over her death.",
    "So that the idea of suicide seemed if not natural at least possible whereas I cant imagine why anyone should want to murder George Barton.",
    "Stephen Farraday said quickly No more can I. Barton was an excellent fellow.",
    "Im sure\nhe hadnt got an enemy in the world.",
    "Chief Inspector Kemp looked at the three inquiring faces turned towards him and reflected\na moment before speaking.",
    "Better let em have it he thought to himself.",
    "What you say is quite correct I am sure Lady Alexandra.",
    "But you see there are a few\nthings that you probably dont know yet.",
    "Lord Kidderminster interposed quickly We mustnt force the Chief Inspectors hand.",
    "It\nis entirely in his discretion what facts he makes public.",
    "Thanks mlord but theres no reason I shouldnt explain things a little more clearly.",
    "Ill\nboil it down to this.",
    "George Barton before his death expressed to two people his belief that\nhis wife had not as was believed committed suicide but had instead been poisoned by\nsome third party.",
    "He also thought that he was on the track of that third party and the\ndinner and celebration last night ostensibly in honour of Miss Marles birthday was really\nsome part of a plan he had made for finding out the identity of his wifes murderer.",
    "There was a moments silence  and in that silence Chief Inspector Kemp who was a\nsensitive man in spite of his wooden appearance felt the presence of something that he\n\n\fclassified as dismay.",
    "It was not apparent on any face but he could have sworn that it was\nthere.",
    "Lord Kidderminster was the first to recover himself.",
    "He said\nBut surely  that belief in itself might point to the fact that poor Barton was not quite  er himself Brooding over his wifes death might have slightly unhinged him mentally.",
    "Quite so Lord Kidderminster but it at least shows that his frame of mind was definitely\nnot suicidal.",
    "Yes  yes I take your point.",
    "And again there was silence.",
    "Then Stephen Farraday said sharply\nBut how did Barton get such an idea into his head After all Mrs Barton did commit\nsuicide.",
    "Chief Inspector Kemp transferred a placid gaze to him.",
    "Mr Barton didnt think so.",
    "Lord Kidderminster interposed.",
    "But the police were satisfied There was no suggestion of anything but suicide at the\ntime\nChief Inspector Kemp said quietly The facts were compatible with suicide.",
    "There was no\nevidence that her death was due to any other agency.",
    "He knew that a man of Lord Kidderminsters calibre would seize on the exact meaning of\nthat.",
    "Becoming slightly more official Kemp said I would like to ask you some questions now if\nI may Lady Alexandra\nCertainly.",
    "She turned her head slightly towards him.",
    "You had no suspicions at the time of Mr Bartons death that it might be murder not\nsuicide\nCertainly not.",
    "I was quite sure it was suicide.",
    "She added I still am.",
    "Kemp let that pass.",
    "He said Have you received any anonymous letters in the past year\nLady Alexandra\nThe calm of her manner seemed broken by pure astonishment.",
    "Anonymous letters Oh no.",
    "Youre quite sure Such letters are very unpleasant things and people usually prefer to\nignore them but they may be particularly important in this case and that is why I want to\nstress that if you did receive any such letters it is most essential that I should know about\nthem.",
    "I see.",
    "But I can only assure you Chief Inspector that I have received nothing of the\nkind.",
    "Very well.",
    "Now you say Mr Bartons manner has been odd this summer.",
    "In what way\nShe considered a minute.",
    "Well he was jumpy nervous.",
    "It seemed difficult for him to focus his attention on what\nwas said to him.",
    "She turned her head towards her husband.",
    "Was that how it struck you\nStephen\nYes I should say that was a very fair description.",
    "The man looked physically ill too.",
    "He\nhad lost weight.",
    "Did you notice any difference in his attitude towards you and your husband Any less\ncordiality for instance\nNo.",
    "On the contrary.",
    "He had bought a house you know quite close to us and he seemed\n\n\fvery grateful for what we were able to do for him  in the way of local introductions I\nmean and all that.",
    "Of course we were only too pleased to do everything we could in that\nline both for him and for Iris Marle who is a charming girl.",
    "Was the late Mrs Barton a great friend of yours Lady Alexandra\nNo we were not very intimate.",
    "She gave a light laugh.",
    "She was really mostly Stephens\nfriend.",
    "She became interested in politics and he helped to  well educate her politically which Im sure he enjoyed.",
    "She was a very charming and attractive woman you know.",
    "And youre a very clever one thought Chief Inspector Kemp to himself appreciatively.",
    "I wonder how much you know about those two  a good deal I shouldnt wonder.",
    "He went on Mr Barton never expressed to you the view that his wife did not commit\nsuicide\nNo indeed.",
    "That was why I was so startled just now.",
    "And Miss Marle She never talked about her sisters death either\nNo.",
    "Have you any idea what made George Barton buy a house in the country Did you or\nyour husband suggest the idea to him\nNo.",
    "It was quite a surprise.",
    "And his manner to you was always friendly\nVery friendly indeed.",
    "And what do you know about Mr Anthony Browne Lady Alexandra\nI really know nothing at all.",
    "I have met him occasionally and that is all.",
    "What about you Mr Farraday\nI think I know probably less about Browne than my wife does.",
    "She at any rate has danced\nwith him.",
    "He seems a likeable chap  American I believe.",
    "Would you say from observation at the time that he was on special terms of intimacy with\nMrs Barton\nI have absolutely no knowledge on that point Chief Inspector.",
    "I am simply asking you for your impression Mr Farraday.",
    "Stephen frowned.",
    "They were friendly  that is all I can say.",
    "And you Lady Alexandra\nSimply my impression Chief Inspector\nSimply your impression.",
    "Then for what it is worth I did form the impression that they knew each other well and\nwere on intimate terms.",
    "Simply you understand from the way they looked at each other  I\nhave no concrete evidence.",
    "Ladies have often very good judgment on these matters said Kemp.",
    "That somewhat\nfatuous smile with which he delivered this remark would have amused Colonel Race if he\nhad been present.",
    "Now what about Miss Lessing Lady Alexandra\nMiss Lessing I understand was Mr Bartons secretary.",
    "I met her for the first time on the\nevening that Mrs Barton died.",
    "After that I met her once when she was staying down in the\ncountry and last night.",
    "If I may ask you another informal question did you form the impression that she was in\nlove with George Barton\nI really havent the least idea.",
    "Then well come to the events of last night.",
    "He questioned both Stephen and his wife minutely on the course of the tragic evening.",
    "He\nhad not hoped for much from this and all he got was confirmation of what he had already\nbeen told.",
    "All accounts agreed on the important points  Barton had proposed a toast to\nIris had drunk it and immediately afterwards had got up to dance.",
    "They had all left the\ntable together and George and Iris had been the first to return to it.",
    "Neither of them had\nany explanation to offer as to the empty chair except that George Barton had distinctly said\nthat he was expecting a friend of his a Colonel Race to occupy it later in the evening  a\nstatement which as the inspector knew could not possibly be the truth.",
    "Sandra Farraday\nsaid and her husband agreed that when the lights went up after the cabaret George had\nstared at the empty chair in a peculiar manner and had for some moments seemed so\nabsentminded as not to hear what was said to him  then he had rallied himself and\nproposed Iriss health.",
    "The only item that the Chief Inspector could count as an addition to his knowledge was\nSandras account of her conversation with George at Fairhaven  and his plea that she and\nher husband would collaborate with him over this party for Iriss sake.",
    "It was a reasonably plausible pretext the Chief Inspector thought though not the true one.",
    "Closing his notebook in which he had jotted down one or two hieroglyphics he rose to his\nfeet.",
    "Im very grateful to you my lord and to Mr Farraday and Lady Alexandra for your help\nand collaboration.",
    "Will my daughters presence be required at the inquest\nThe proceedings will be purely formal on this occasion.",
    "Evidence of identification and the\nmedical evidence will be taken and the inquest will then be adjourned for a week.",
    "By then\nsaid the Chief Inspector his tone changing slightly we shall I hope be further on.",
    "He turned to Stephen Farraday By the way Mr Farraday there are one or two small\npoints where I think you could help me.",
    "No need to trouble Lady Alexandra.",
    "If you will\ngive me a ring at the Yard we can settle a time that will suit you.",
    "You are I know a busy\nman.",
    "It was pleasantly said with an air of casualness but on three pairs of ears the words fell\nwith deliberate meaning.",
    "With an air of friendly cooperation Stephen managed to say\nCertainly Chief Inspector.",
    "Then he looked at his watch and murmured I must go\nalong to the House.",
    "When Stephen had hurried off and the Chief Inspector had likewise departed.",
    "Lord\nKidderminster turned to his daughter and asked a question with no beating about the\nbush.",
    "Had Stephen been having an affair with that woman\nThere was a split second of a pause before his daughter answered.",
    "Of course not.",
    "I should have known it if he had.",
    "And anyway Stephens not that kind.",
    "Now look here my dear no good laying your ears back and digging your hoofs in.",
    "These\nthings are bound to come out.",
    "We want to know where we are in this business.",
    "Rosemary Barton was a friend of that man Anthony Browne.",
    "They went about\neverywhere together.",
    "Well said Lord Kidderminster slowly.",
    "You should know.",
    "He did not believe his daughter.",
    "His face as he went slowly out of the room was grey and\nperplexed.",
    "He went upstairs to his wifes sittingroom.",
    "He had vetoed her presence in the\n\n\flibrary knowing too well that her arrogant methods were apt to arouse antagonism and at\nthis juncture he felt it vital that relations with the official police should be harmonious.",
    "Well said Lady Kidderminster.",
    "How did it go off\nQuite well on the face of it said Lord Kidderminster slowly.",
    "Kemp is a courteous fellow\n very pleasant in his manner  he handled the whole thing with tact  just a little too much\ntact for my fancy.",
    "Its serious then\nYes its serious.",
    "We should never have let Sandra marry that fellow Vicky.",
    "Thats what I said.",
    "Yes  yes...",
    "He acknowledged her claim.",
    "You were right  and I was wrong.",
    "But mind\nyou she would have had him anyway.",
    "You cant turn Sandra when her mind is fixed on a\nthing.",
    "Her meeting Farraday was a disaster  a man of whose antecedents and ancestors we\nknow nothing.",
    "When a crisis comes how does one know how a man like that will react\nI see said Lady Kidderminster.",
    "You think weve taken a murderer into the family\nI dont know.",
    "I dont want to condemn the fellow offhand  but its what the police think and theyre pretty shrewd.",
    "He had an affair with this Barton woman  thats plain enough.",
    "Either she committed suicide on his account or else he  Well whatever happened Barton\ngot wise to it and was heading for an expose and scandal.",
    "I suppose Stephen simply\ncouldnt take it  and \nPoisoned him\nYes.",
    "Lady Kidderminster shook her head.",
    "I dont agree with you.",
    "I hope youre right.",
    "But somebody poisoned him.",
    "If you ask me said Lady Kidderminster Stephen simply wouldnt have the nerve to do\na thing like that.",
    "Hes in deadly earnest about his career  hes got great gifts you know and the makings\nof a true statesman.",
    "You cant say what anyone will do when theyre forced into a corner.",
    "His wife still shook her head.",
    "I still say he hasnt got the nerve.",
    "You want someone whos a gambler and capable of\nbeing reckless.",
    "Im afraid William Im horribly afraid.",
    "He stared at her.",
    "Are you suggesting that Sandra  Sandra \nI hate even to suggest such a thing  but its no use being cowardly and refusing to face\npossibilities.",
    "Shes besotted about that man  she always has been  and theres a queer\nstreak in Sandra.",
    "Ive never really understood her  but Ive always been afraid for her.",
    "Shed risk anything  anything  for Stephen.",
    "Without counting the cost.",
    "And if shes been\nmad enough and wicked enough to do this thing shes got to be protected.",
    "Protected What do you mean  protected\nBy you.",
    "Weve got to do something about our own daughter havent we Mercifully you\ncan pull any amount of strings.",
    "Lord Kidderminster was staring at her.",
    "Though he had thought he knew his wifes\ncharacter well he was nevertheless appalled at the force and courage of her realism  at her\nrefusal to blink at unpalatable facts  and also at her unscrupulousness.",
    "If my daughters a murderess do you suggest that I should use my official position to\nrescue her from the consequences of her act\nOf course said Lady Kidderminster.",
    "My dear Vicky You dont understand One cant do things like that.",
    "It would be a breach\nof  of honour.",
    "Rubbish said Lady Kidderminster.",
    "They looked at each other  so far divided that neither could see the others point of view.",
    "So might Agamemnon and Clytemnestra have stared at each other with the word Iphigenia\non their lips.",
    "You could bring government pressure to bear on the police so that the whole thing is\ndropped and a verdict of suicide brought in.",
    "It has been done before  dont pretend.",
    "That has been when it was a matter of public policy  in the interests of the State.",
    "This is a\npersonal and private matter.",
    "I doubt very much whether I could do such a thing.",
    "You can if you have sufficient determination.",
    "Lord Kidderminster flushed angrily.",
    "If I could I wouldnt It would be abusing my public position.",
    "If Sandra were arrested and tried wouldnt you employ the best counsel and do\neverything possible to get her off however guilty she was\nOf course of course.",
    "Thats entirely different.",
    "You women never grasp these things.",
    "Lady Kidderminster was silent unperturbed by the thrust.",
    "Sandra was the least dear to\nher of her children  nevertheless she was at this moment a mother and a mother only willing to defend her young by any means honourable or dishonourable.",
    "She would fight\nwith tooth and claw for Sandra.",
    "In any case said Lord Kidderminster Sandra will not be charged unless there is an\nabsolutely convincing case against her.",
    "And I for one refuse to believe that a daughter of\nmine is a murderess.",
    "Im astonished at you Vicky for entertaining such an idea for a\nmoment.",
    "His wife said nothing and Lord Kidderminster went uneasily out of the room.",
    "To think\nthat Vicky  Vicky  whom he had known intimately for so many years  should prove to\nhave such unsuspected and really very disturbing depths in her\nChapter 5\nRace found Ruth Lessing busy with papers at a large desk.",
    "She was dressed in a black coat\nand skirt and a white blouse and he was impressed by her quiet unhurried efficiency.",
    "He\nnoticed the dark circles under her eyes and the unhappy set line of her mouth but her\ngrief if grief it was was as well controlled as all her other emotions.",
    "Race explained his visit and she responded at once.",
    "It is very good of you to come.",
    "Of course I know who you are.",
    "Mr Barton was expecting\nyou to join us last night was he not I remember his saying so.",
    "Did he mention that before the evening itself\nShe thought for a moment.",
    "No.",
    "It was when we were actually taking our seats round the table.",
    "I remember that I was\na little surprised  She paused and flushed slightly.",
    "Not of course at his inviting you.",
    "You are an old friend I know.",
    "And you were to have been at the other party a year ago.",
    "All\nI meant was that I was surprised if you were coming that Mr Barton hadnt invited\nanother woman to balance the numbers  but of course if you were going to be late and\nmight perhaps not come at all  She broke off.",
    "How stupid I am.",
    "Why go over all these\npetty things that dont matter I am stupid this morning.",
    "But you have come to work as usual\nOf course.",
    "She looked surprised  almost shocked.",
    "It is my job.",
    "There is so much to\nclear up and arrange.",
    "George always told me how much he relied upon you said Race gently.",
    "She turned away.",
    "He saw her swallow quickly and blink her eyes.",
    "Her absence of any\ndisplay of emotion almost convinced him of her entire innocence.",
    "Almost but not quite.",
    "He\nhad met women who were good actresses before now women whose reddened eyelids and\nthe black circles underneath whose eyes had been due to art and not to natural causes.",
    "Reserving judgment he said to himself At any rate shes a cool customer.",
    "Ruth turned back to the desk and in answer to his last remark she said quietly\nI was with him for many years  it will be eight years next April  and I knew his ways\nand I think he  trusted me.",
    "Im sure of that.",
    "He went on It is nearly lunchtime.",
    "I hoped you would come out and lunch quietly with\nme somewhere There is a good deal I would like to say to you.",
    "Thank you.",
    "I should like to very much.",
    "He took her to a small restaurant that he knew of where the tables were set far apart and\nwhere a quiet conversation was possible.",
    "He ordered and when the waiter had gone looked across the table at his companion.",
    "She was a goodlooking girl he decided with her sleek dark head and her firm mouth and\nchin.",
    "He talked a little on desultory topics until the food was brought and she followed his lead\nshowing herself intelligent and sensible.",
    "Presently after a pause she said You want to talk to me about last night Please dont\nhesitate to do so.",
    "The whole thing is so incredible that I would like to talk about it.",
    "Except\nthat it happened and I saw it happen I would not have believed it.",
    "Youve seen Chief Inspector Kemp of course\nYes last night.",
    "He seems intelligent and experienced.",
    "She paused.",
    "Was it really murder\nColonel Race\nDid Kemp tell you so\nHe didnt volunteer any information but his questions made it plain enough what he had\nin mind.",
    "Your opinion as to whether or not it was suicide should be as good as anyones Miss\nLessing.",
    "You knew Barton well and you were with him most of yesterday I imagine.",
    "How\ndid he seem Much as usual Or was he disturbed  upset  excited\nShe hesitated.",
    "Its difficult.",
    "He was upset and disturbed  but then there was a reason for that.",
    "She explained the situation that had arisen in regard to Victor Drake and gave a brief\nsketch of that young mans career.",
    "Hm said Race.",
    "The inevitable black sheep.",
    "And Barton was upset about him\nRuth said slowly Its difficult to explain.",
    "I knew Mr Barton so well you see.",
    "He was\nannoyed and bothered about the business  and I gather Mrs Drake had been very tearful\nand upset as she always was on these occasions  so of course he wanted to straighten it all\nout.",
    "But I had the impression \nYes Miss Lessing Im sure your impressions will be accurate.",
    "Well then I fancied that his annoyance was not quite the usual annoyance if I may put it\n\n\flike that.",
    "Because we had had this same business before in one form or another.",
    "Last year\nVictor Drake was in this country and in trouble and we had to ship him off to South\nAmerica and only last June he cabled home for money.",
    "So you see I was familiar with Mr\nBartons reactions.",
    "And it seemed to me this time that his annoyance was principally at the\ncable having arrived just at this moment when he was entirely preoccupied with the\narrangements for the party he was giving.",
    "He seemed so taken up by the preparations for it\nthat he grudged any other preoccupation arising.",
    "Did it strike you that there was anything odd about this party of his Miss Lessing\nYes it did.",
    "Mr Barton was really most peculiar about it.",
    "He was excited  like a child\nmight have been.",
    "Did it occur to you that there might have been a special purpose for such a party\nYou mean that it was a replica of the party a year ago when Mrs Barton committed\nsuicide\nYes.",
    "Frankly I thought it a most extraordinary idea.",
    "But George didnt volunteer any explanation  or confide in you in any way\nShe shook her head.",
    "Tell me Miss Lessing has there ever been any doubt in your mind as to Mrs Bartons\nhaving committed suicide\nShe looked astonished.",
    "Oh no.",
    "George Barton didnt tell you that he believed his wife had been murdered\nShe stared at him.",
    "George believed that\nI see that is news to you.",
    "Yes Miss Lessing George had received anonymous letters\nstating that his wife had not committed suicide but had been killed.",
    "So that is why he became so odd this summer I couldnt think what was the matter with\nhim.",
    "You knew nothing about these anonymous letters\nNothing.",
    "Were there many of them\nHe showed me two.",
    "And I knew nothing about them\nThere was a note of bitter hurt in her voice.",
    "He watched her for a moment or two then he\nsaid\nWell Miss Lessing what do you say Is it possible in your opinion for George to have\ncommitted suicide\nShe shook her head.",
    "No  oh no.",
    "But you said he was excited  upset\nYes but he had been like that for some time.",
    "I see why now.",
    "And I see why he was so\nexcited about last nights party.",
    "He must have had some special idea in his head  he must\nhave hoped that by reproducing the conditions he would gain some additional knowledge poor George he must have been so muddled about it all.",
    "And what about Rosemary Barton Miss Lessing Do you still think her death was\nsuicide\nShe frowned.",
    "Ive never dreamt of it being anything else.",
    "It seemed so natural.",
    "Depression after influenza\nWell rather more than that perhaps.",
    "She was definitely very unhappy.",
    "One could see\nthat.",
    "And guess the cause\nWell  yes.",
    "At least I did.",
    "Of course I may have been wrong.",
    "But women like Mrs Barton\nare very transparent  they dont trouble to hide their feelings.",
    "Mercifully I dont think Mr\nBarton knew anything... Oh yes she was very unhappy.",
    "And I know she had a bad\nheadache that night besides being run down with flu.",
    "How did you know she had a headache\nI heard her telling Lady Alexandra so  in the cloakroom when we were taking off our\nwraps.",
    "She was wishing she had a Cachet Faivre and luckily Lady Alexandra had one with\nher and gave it to her.",
    "Colonel Races hand stopped with a glass in mid air.",
    "And she took it\nYes.",
    "He put his glass down untasted and looked across the table.",
    "The girl looked placid and\nunaware of any significance in what she had said.",
    "But it was significant.",
    "It meant that\nSandra who from her position at table would have had the most difficulty in putting\nanything unseen in Rosemarys glass had had another opportunity of administering the\npoison.",
    "She could have given it to Rosemary in a cachet.",
    "Ordinarily a cachet would take\nonly a few minutes to dissolve but possible this had been a special kind of cachet it might\nhave had a lining of gelatine or some other substance.",
    "Or Rosemary might possibly not\nhave swallowed it then but later.",
    "He said abruptly Did you see her take it\nI beg your pardon\nHe saw by her puzzled face that her mind had gone on elsewhere.",
    "Did you see Rosemary Barton swallow that cachet\nRuth looked a little startled.",
    "I  well no I didnt actually see her.",
    "She just thanked Lady Alexandra.",
    "So Rosemary might have slipped the cachet in her bag and then during the cabaret with a\nheadache increasing she might have dropped it into her champagne glass and let it\ndissolve.",
    "Assumption  pure assumption  but a possibility.",
    "Ruth said Why do you ask me that\nHer eyes were suddenly alert full of questions.",
    "He watched so it seemed to him her\nintelligence working.",
    "Then she said Oh I see.",
    "I see why George took that house down there near the\nFarradays.",
    "And I see why he didnt tell me about those letters.",
    "It seemed to me so\nextraordinary that he hadnt.",
    "But of course if he believed them it meant that one of us one\nof those five people round the table must have killed her.",
    "It might  it might even have been\nme\nRace said in a very gentle voice Had you any reason for killing Rosemary Barton\nHe thought at first that she hadnt heard the question.",
    "She sat so very still with her eyes\ncast down.",
    "But suddenly with a sigh she raised them and looked straight at him.",
    "It is not the sort of thing one cares to talk about she said.",
    "But I think you had better\nknow.",
    "I was in love with George Barton.",
    "I was in love with him before he even met\n\n\fRosemary.",
    "I dont think he ever knew  certainly he didnt care.",
    "He was fond of me  very\nfond of me  but I suppose never in that way.",
    "And yet I used to think that I would have\nmade him a good wife  that I could have made him happy.",
    "He loved Rosemary but he\nwasnt happy with her.",
    "Race said gently And you disliked Rosemary\nYes I did.",
    "Oh She was very lovely and very attractive and could be very charming in her\nway.",
    "She never bothered to be charming to me I disliked her a good deal.",
    "I was shocked\nwhen she died  and at the way she died but I wasnt really sorry.",
    "Im afraid I was rather\nglad.",
    "She paused.",
    "Please shall we talk about something else\nRace responded quickly Id like you to tell me exactly in detail everything you can\nremember about yesterday  from the morning onwards  especially anything George did\nor said.",
    "Ruth replied promptly going over the events of the morning  Georges annoyance over\nVictors importunity her own telephone calls to South America and the arrangements\nmade and Georges pleasure when the matter was settled.",
    "She then described her arrival at\nthe Luxembourg and Georges flurried excited bearing as host.",
    "She carried her narrative\nup to the final moment of the tragedy.",
    "Her account tallied in every respect with those he\nhad already heard.",
    "With a worried frown Ruth voiced his own perplexity.",
    "It wasnt suicide  Im sure it wasnt suicide  but how can it have been murder I mean\nhow can it have been done The answer is it couldnt not by one of us Then was it\nsomeone who slipped the poison into Georges glass while we were away dancing But if so\nwho could it have been It doesnt seem to make sense.",
    "The evidence is that no one went near the table while you were dancing.",
    "Then it really doesnt make sense Cyanide doesnt get into a glass by itself\nHave you absolutely no idea  no suspicion even who might have put the cyanide in the\nglass Think back over last night.",
    "Is there nothing no small incident that awakens your\nsuspicions in any degree however small\nHe saw her face change saw for a moment uncertainty come into her eyes.",
    "There was a\ntiny almost infinitesimal pause before she answered Nothing.",
    "But there had been something.",
    "He was sure of that.",
    "Something she had seen or heard or\nnoticed that for some reason or other she had decided not to tell.",
    "He did not press her.",
    "He knew that with a girl of Ruths type that would be no good.",
    "If for\nsome reason she had made up her mind to keep silence she would not he felt sure change\nher mind.",
    "But there had been something.",
    "That knowledge cheered him and gave him fresh assurance.",
    "It was the first sign of a crevice in the blank wall that confronted him.",
    "He took leave of Ruth after lunch and drove to Elvaston Square thinking of the woman he\nhad just left.",
    "Was it possible that Ruth Lessing was guilty On the whole he was prepossessed in her\nfavour.",
    "She had seemed entirely frank and straightforward.",
    "Was she capable of murder Most people were if you came to it.",
    "Capable not of murder in\ngeneral but of one particular individual murder.",
    "That was what made it so difficult to\nweed anyone out.",
    "There was a certain quality of ruthlessness about that young woman.",
    "And she had a motive  or rather a choice of motives.",
    "By removing Rosemary she had a\nvery good chance of becoming Mrs George Barton.",
    "Whether it was a question of marrying\na rich man or of marrying the man she had loved the removal of Rosemary was the first\nessential.",
    "Race was inclined to think that marrying a rich man was not enough.",
    "Ruth Lessing was too\ncoolheaded and cautious to risk her neck for mere comfortable living as a rich mans wife.",
    "Love Perhaps.",
    "For all her cool and detached manner he suspected her of being one of\nthose women who can be kindled to unlikely passion by one particular man.",
    "Given love of George and hate of Rosemary she might have coolly planned and executed\nRosemarys death.",
    "The fact that it had gone off without a hitch and that suicide had been\nuniversally accepted without demur proved her inherent capability.",
    "And then George had received anonymous letters From whom Why That was the\nteasing vexing problem that never ceased to nag at him and had grown suspicious.",
    "He had\nplanned a trap.",
    "And Ruth had silenced him.",
    "No that wasnt right.",
    "That didnt ring true.",
    "That spelt panic  and Ruth Lessing was not the kind of woman who panicked.",
    "She had\nbetter brains than George and could have avoided any trap that he was likely to set with\nthe greatest of ease.",
    "It looked as though Ruth didnt add up after all.",
    "Chapter 6\nLucilla Drake was thrilled and delighted to see Colonel Race.",
    "The blinds were all down and Lucilla came into the room draped in black and with a\nhandkerchief to her eyes and explained as she advanced a tremulous hand to meet his how\nof course she couldnt have seen anyone  anyone at all  except such an old friend of dear\ndear Georges  and it was so dreadful to have no man in the house Really without a man\nin the house one didnt know how to tackle anything.",
    "Just herself a poor lonely widow and\nIris just a helpless young girl and George had always looked after everything.",
    "So kind of\ndear Colonel Race and really she was so grateful  no idea what they ought to do.",
    "Of course\nMiss Lessing would attend to all business matters  and the funeral to arrange for  but how\nabout the inquest and so dreadful having the police  actually in the house  plain clothes\nof course and really very considerate.",
    "But she was so bewildered and the whole thing was\nsuch an absolute tragedy and didnt Colonel Race think it must be all due to suggestion that was what the psychoanalysts said wasnt it that everything is suggestion And poor\nGeorge at that horrid place the Luxembourg and practically the same party and\nremembering how poor Rosemary had died there  and it must have come over him quite\nsuddenly only if hed listened to what she Lucilla had said and taken that excellent tonic\nof dear Dr Gaskells  run down all the summer  yes thoroughly run down.",
    "Whereupon Lucilla herself ran down temporarily and Race had a chance to speak.",
    "He said how deeply he sympathised and how Mrs Drake must count upon him in every\nway.",
    "Whereupon Lucilla started off again and said it was indeed kind of him and it was the\nshock that had been so terrible  here today and gone tomorrow as it said in the Bible\ncometh up like grass and cut down in the evening  only that wasnt quite right but Colonel\nRace would know what she meant and it was so nice to feel there was someone on whom\nthey could rely.",
    "Miss Lessing meant well of course and was very efficient but rather an\n\n\funsympathetic manner and sometimes took things upon herself a little too much and in\nher Lucillas opinion George had always relied upon her far too much and at one time\nshe had been really afraid that he might do something foolish which would have been a\ngreat pity and probably she would have bullied him unmercifully once they were married.",
    "Of course she Lucilla had seen what was in the wind.",
    "Dear Iris was so unworldly and it\nwas nice didnt Colonel Race think for young girls to be unspoilt and simple Iris had\nreally always been very young for her age and very quiet  one didnt know half the time\nwhat she was thinking about.",
    "Rosemary being so pretty and so gay had been out a great\ndeal and Iris had mooned about the house which wasnt really right for a young girl  they\nshould go to classes  cooking and perhaps dressmaking.",
    "It occupied their minds and one\nnever knew when it might come in useful.",
    "It had really been a mercy that she Lucilla had\nbeen free to come and live here after poor Rosemarys death  that horrid flu quite an\nunusual kind of flu Dr Gaskell had said.",
    "Such a clever man and such a nice breezy\nmanner.",
    "She had wanted Iris to see him this summer.",
    "The girl had looked so white and pulled down.",
    "But really Colonel Race I think it was the situation of the house.",
    "Low you know and\ndamp with quite a miasma in the evenings.",
    "Poor George had gone off and bought it all by\nhimself without asking anyones advice  such a pity.",
    "He had said he wanted it to be a\nsurprise but really it would have been better if he had taken some older womans advice.",
    "Men knew nothing about houses.",
    "George might have realised that she Lucilla would have\nbeen willing to take any amount of trouble.",
    "For after all what was her life now Her dear\nhusband dead many years ago and Victor her dear boy far away in the Argentine  she\nmeant Brazil or was it the Argentine Such an affectionate handsome boy.",
    "Colonel Race said he had heard she had a son abroad.",
    "For the next quarter of an hour he was regaled with a full account of Victors\nmultitudinous activities.",
    "Such a spirited boy willing to turn his hand to anything  here\nfollowed a list of Victors varied occupations.",
    "Never unkind or bearing malice to anyone.",
    "Hes always been unlucky Colonel Race.",
    "He was misjudged by his housemaster and I\nconsider the authorities at Oxford behaved quite disgracefully.",
    "People dont seem to\nunderstand that a clever boy with a taste for drawing would think it an excellent joke to\nimitate someones handwriting.",
    "He did it for the fun of the thing not for money.",
    "But hed\nalways been a good son to his mother and he never failed to let her know when he was in\ntrouble which showed didnt it that he trusted her Only it did seem curious didnt it\nthat the jobs people found for him so often seemed to take him out of England.",
    "She couldnt\nhelp feeling that if only he could be given a nice job in the Bank of England say he would\nsettle down much better.",
    "He might perhaps live a little out of London and have a little car.",
    "It was quite twenty minutes before Colonel Race having heard all Victors perfections and\nmisfortunes was able to switch Lucilla from the subject of sons to that of servants.",
    "Yes it was very true what he said the oldfashioned type of servant didnt exist any longer.",
    "Really the trouble people had nowadays Not that she ought to complain for really they\nhad been very lucky.",
    "Mrs Pound though she had the misfortune to be slightly deaf was an\nexcellent woman.",
    "Her pastry sometimes a little heavy and a tendency to overpepper the\nsoup but really on the whole most reliable  and economical too.",
    "She had been there ever since George married and she had made no fuss about going to the\ncountry this year though there had been trouble with the others over that and the\nparlourmaid had left  but that really was all for the best  an impertinent girl who\n\n\fanswered back  besides breaking six of the best wineglasses not one by one at odd times\nwhich might happen to anybody but all at once which really meant gross carelessness\ndidnt Colonel Race think so\nVery careless indeed.",
    "That is what I told her.",
    "And I said to her that I should be obliged to say so in her\nreference  for I really feel one has a duty Colonel Race.",
    "I mean one should not mislead.",
    "Faults should be mentioned as well as good qualities.",
    "But the girl was  really  well quite\ninsolent and said that at any rate she hoped that in her next place she wouldnt be in the\nkind of house where people got bumped off  a dreadful common expression acquired at\nthe cinema I believe and ludicrously inappropriate since poor dear Rosemary took her\nown life  though not at the time responsible for her actions as the coroner very rightly\npointed out  and that dreadful expression refers I believe to gangsters executing each\nother with tommyguns.",
    "I am so thankful that we have nothing of that kind in England.",
    "And\nso as I say I put in her reference that Betty Archdale thoroughly understood her duties as\nparlourmaid and was sober and honest but that she was inclined to have too many\nbreakages and was not always respectful in her manner.",
    "And personally if I had been Mrs\nReesTalbot I should have read between the lines and not engaged her.",
    "But people\nnowadays just jump at anything they can get and will sometimes take a girl who has only\nstayed her month in three places running.",
    "Whilst Mrs Drake paused to take breath Colonel Race asked quickly whether that was\nMrs Richard ReesTalbot If so he had known her he said in India.",
    "I really couldnt say.",
    "Cadogan Square was the address.",
    "Then it is my friends.",
    "Lucilla said that the world was such a small place wasnt it And that there were no\nfriends like old friends.",
    "Friendship was a wonderful thing.",
    "She had always thought it had\nbeen so romantic about Viola and Paul.",
    "Dear Viola she had been a lovely girl and so many\nmen in love with her but oh dear Colonel Race wouldnt even know who she was talking\nabout.",
    "One did so tend to relive the past.",
    "Colonel Race begged her to go on and in return for this politeness received the life history\nof Hector Marle of his upbringing by his sister of his peculiarities and his weaknesses and\nfinally when Colonel Race had almost forgotten her of his marriage to the beautiful Viola.",
    "She was an orphan you know and a ward in Chancery.",
    "He heard how Paul Bennett\nconquering his disappointment at Violas refusal had transformed himself from lover to\nfamily friend and of his fondness for his godchild Rosemary and of his death and the\nterms of his will.",
    "Which I have always felt most romantic  such an enormous fortune Not\nof course that money is everything  no indeed.",
    "One has only to think of poor Rosemarys\ntragic death.",
    "And even dear Iris I am not quite happy about Race gave her an inquiring\nlook.",
    "I find the responsibility most worrying.",
    "The fact that she is a great heiress is of course well\nknown.",
    "I keep a very sharp eye on the undesirable type of young man but what can one do\nColonel Race One cant look after girls nowadays as one used to do.",
    "Iris has friends I\nknow next to nothing about.",
    "Ask them to the house dear is what I always say  but I\ngather that some of these young men simply will not be brought.",
    "Poor George was worried\ntoo.",
    "About a young man called Browne.",
    "I myself have never seen him but it seems that he\nand Iris have been seeing a good deal of each other.",
    "And one does feel that she could do\nbetter.",
    "George didnt like him  Im quite sure of that.",
    "And I always think Colonel Race\n\n\fthat men are so much better judges of other men.",
    "I remember thinking Colonel Pusey one\nof our churchwardens such a charming man but my husband always preserved a very\ndistant attitude towards him and enjoined on me to do the same  and sure enough one\nSunday when he was handing round the offertory plate he fell right down  completely\nintoxicated it seems.",
    "And of course afterwards  one always hears these things afterwards\nso much better if one heard them before  we found out that dozens of empty brandy\nbottles were taken out of the house every week It was very sad really because he was truly\nreligious though inclined to be Evangelical in his views.",
    "He and my husband had a terrific\nbattle over the details of the service on All Saints Day.",
    "Oh dear.",
    "All Saints Day.",
    "To think\nthat yesterday was All Souls Day.",
    "A faint sound made Race look over Lucillas head at the open doorway.",
    "He had seen Iris\nbefore  at Little Priors.",
    "Nevertheless he felt that he was seeing her now for the first time.",
    "He was struck by the extraordinary tension behind her stillness and her wide eyes met his\nwith something in their expression that he felt he ought to recognise yet failed to do so.",
    "In her turn Lucilla Drake turned her head.",
    "Iris dear I didnt hear you come in.",
    "You know Colonel Race He is being so very kind.",
    "Iris came and shook hands with him gravely the black dress she wore made her look\nthinner and paler than he remembered her.",
    "I came to see if I could be of any help to you said Race.",
    "Thank you.",
    "That was kind of you.",
    "She had had a bad shock that was evident and was still suffering from the effects of it.",
    "But\nhad she been so fond of George that his death could affect her so powerfully\nShe turned her eyes to her aunt and Race realised that they were watchful eyes.",
    "She said\nWhat were you talking about  just now as I came in\nLucilla became pink and flustered.",
    "Race guessed that she was anxious to avoid any mention\nof the young man Anthony Browne.",
    "She exclaimed Now let me see  oh yes.",
    "All Saints Day  and yesterday being All Souls.",
    "All Souls  that seems to me such an odd thing  one of those coincidences one never\nbelieves in in real life.",
    "Do you mean said Iris that Rosemary came back yesterday to fetch George\nLucilla gave a little scream.",
    "Iris dear dont.",
    "What a terrible thought  so unChristian.",
    "Why unChristian Its the Day of the Dead.",
    "In Paris people used to go and put flowers on\nthe graves.",
    "Oh I know dear but then they are Catholics arent they\nA faint smile twisted Irises lips.",
    "Then she said directly\nI thought perhaps you were talking of Anthony  Anthony Browne.",
    "Well Lucillas twitter became very high and birdlike as a matter of fact we did just\nmention him.",
    "I happened to say you know that we know nothing about him \nIris interrupted her voice hard Why should you know anything about him\nNo dear of course not.",
    "At least I mean well it would be rather nicer wouldnt it if we\ndid\nYoull have every chance of doing so in future said Iris because Im going to marry\nhim.",
    "Oh Iris It was halfway between a wail and a bleat.",
    "You mustnt do anything rash  I\nmean nothing can be settled at present.",
    "It is settled Aunt Lucilla.",
    "No dear one cant talk about things like marriage when the funeral hasnt even taken\nplace yet.",
    "It wouldnt be decent.",
    "And this dreadful inquest and everything.",
    "And really Iris\nI dont think dear George would have approved.",
    "He didnt like this Mr Browne.",
    "No said Iris George wouldnt have liked it and he didnt like Anthony but that doesnt\nmake any difference.",
    "Its my life not Georges  and anyway George is dead...\nMrs Drake gave another wail.",
    "Iris Iris.",
    "What has come over you Really that was a most unfeeling thing to say.",
    "Im sorry Aunt Lucilla.",
    "The girl spoke wearily.",
    "I know it must have sounded like that\nbut I didnt mean it that way.",
    "I only meant that George is at peace somewhere and hasnt\ngot to worry about me and my future any more.",
    "I must decide things for myself.",
    "Nonsense dear nothing can be decided at a time like this  it would be most unfitting.",
    "The\nquestion simply doesnt arise.",
    "Iris gave a sudden short laugh.",
    "But it has arisen.",
    "Anthony asked me to marry him before we left Little Priors.",
    "He wanted\nme to come up to London and marry him the next day without telling anyone.",
    "I wish now\nthat I had.",
    "Surely that was a very curious request said Colonel Race gently.",
    "She turned defiant eyes to him.",
    "No it wasnt.",
    "It would have saved a lot of fuss.",
    "Why couldnt I trust him He asked me to\ntrust him and I didnt.",
    "Anyway Ill marry him now as soon as he likes.",
    "Lucilla burst out in a stream of incoherent protest.",
    "Her plump cheeks quivered and her\neyes filled.",
    "Colonel Race took rapid charge of the situation.",
    "Miss Marle might I have a word with you before I go On a strictly business matter\nRather startled the girl murmured Yes and found herself moving to the door.",
    "As she\npassed through Race took a couple of strides back to Mrs Drake.",
    "Dont upset yourself Mrs Drake.",
    "Least said you know soonest mended.",
    "Well see what\nwe can do.",
    "Leaving her slightly comforted he followed Iris who led him across the hall and into a small\nroom giving out on the back of the house where a melancholy planetree was shedding its\nlast leaves.",
    "Race spoke in a businesslike tone.",
    "All I had to say Miss Marle was that Chief Inspector Kemp is a personal friend of mine\nand that I am sure you will find him most helpful and kindly.",
    "His duty is an unpleasant\none but Im sure he will do it with the utmost consideration possible.",
    "She looked at him for a moment or two without speaking then she said abruptly\nWhy didnt you come and join us last night as George expected you to do\nHe shook his head.",
    "George didnt expect me.",
    "But he said he did.",
    "He may have said so but it wasnt true.",
    "George knew perfectly well that I wasnt\ncoming.",
    "She said But that empty chair... Who was it for\nNot for me.",
    "Her eyes halfclosed and her face went very white.",
    "She whispered It was for Rosemary...",
    "I see...",
    "It was for Rosemary...",
    "He thought she was going to fall.",
    "He came quickly to her and steadied her then forced her\nto sit down.",
    "Take it easy...\nShe said in a low breathless voice Im all right...",
    "But I dont know what to do...",
    "I dont\nknow what to do.",
    "Can I help you\nShe raised her eyes to his face.",
    "They were wistful and sombre.",
    "Then she said I must get things clear.",
    "I must get them  she made a groping gesture with\nher hands  in sequence.",
    "First of all George believed Rosemary didnt kill herself  but\nwas killed.",
    "He believed that because of those letters.",
    "Colonel Race who wrote those\nletters\nI dont know.",
    "Nobody knows.",
    "Have you yourself any idea\nI simply cant imagine.",
    "Anyway George believed what they said and he arranged this\nparty last night and he had an empty chair and it was All Souls Day... thats the Day of the\nDead  it was a day when Rosemarys spirit could have come back and  and told him the\ntruth.",
    "You mustnt be too imaginative.",
    "But Ive felt her myself  felt her quite near sometimes  Im her sister  and I think shes\ntrying to tell me something.",
    "Take it easy Iris.",
    "I must talk about it.",
    "George drank Rosemarys health and he  died.",
    "Perhaps  she came\nand took him.",
    "The spirits of the dead dont put potassium cyanide in a champagne glass my dear\nThe words seemed to restore her balance.",
    "She said in a more normal tone But its so incredible.",
    "George was killed  yes killed.",
    "Thats what the police think and it must be true.",
    "Because there isnt any other alternative.",
    "But it doesnt make sense.",
    "Dont you think it does If Rosemary was killed and George was beginning to suspect by\nwhom \nShe interrupted him.",
    "Yes but Rosemary wasnt killed.",
    "Thats why it doesnt make sense.",
    "George believed those\nstupid letters partly because depression after influenza isnt a very convincing reason for\nkilling yourself.",
    "But Rosemary had a reason.",
    "Look Ill show you.",
    "She ran out of the room and returned a few moments later with a folded letter in her hand.",
    "She thrust it on him.",
    "Read it.",
    "See for yourself.",
    "He unfolded the slightly crumpled sheet.",
    "Leopard darling...",
    "He read it twice before handing it back.",
    "The girl said eagerly You see She was unhappy  brokenhearted.",
    "She didnt want to go\non living.",
    "Do you know to whom that letter was written\nIris nodded.",
    "Stephen Farraday.",
    "It wasnt Anthony.",
    "She was in love with Stephen and he was cruel to\nher.",
    "So she took the stuff with her to the restaurant and drank it there where he could see\n\n\fher die.",
    "Perhaps she hoped hed be sorry then.",
    "Race nodded thoughtfully but said nothing\nAfter a moment or two he said When did you find this\nAbout six months ago.",
    "It was in the pocket of an old dressinggown.",
    "You didnt show it to George\nIris cried passionately How could I How could I Rosemary was my sister.",
    "How could I\ngive her away to George He was so sure that she loved him.",
    "How could I show him this\nafter she was dead Hed got it all wrong but I couldnt tell him so.",
    "But what I want to\nknow is what am I to do now Ive shown it to you because you were Georges friend.",
    "Has\nInspector Kemp got to see it\nYes.",
    "Kemp must have it.",
    "Its evidence you see.",
    "But then theyll  they might read it out in court\nNot necessarily.",
    "That doesnt follow.",
    "Its Georges death that is being investigated.",
    "Nothing will be made public that is not strictly relevant.",
    "You had better let me take this\nnow.",
    "Very well.",
    "She went with him to the front door.",
    "As he opened it she said abruptly\nIt does show doesnt it that Rosemarys death was suicide\nRace said It certainly shows that she had a motive for taking her own life.",
    "She gave a deep sigh.",
    "He went down the steps.",
    "Glancing back once he saw her standing\nframed in the open doorway watching him walk away across the square.",
    "Chapter 7\nMary ReesTalbot just greeted Colonel Race with a positive shriek of unbelief.",
    "My dear I havent seen you since you disappeared so mysteriously from Allahabad that\ntime.",
    "And why are you here now It isnt to see me Im quite sure.",
    "You never pay social\ncalls.",
    "Come on now own up you neednt be diplomatic about it.",
    "Diplomatic methods would be a waste of time with you Mary.",
    "I always have appreciated\nyour Xray mind.",
    "Cut the cackle and come to the horses my pet.",
    "Race smiled.",
    "Is the maid who let me in Betty Archdale he inquired.",
    "So thats it Now dont tell me that that girl a pure Cockney if ever there was one is a\nwellknown European spy because I simply dont believe it.",
    "No no nothing of the kind.",
    "And dont tell me shes one of our counterespionage either because I dont believe that.",
    "Quite right.",
    "The girl is simply a parlourmaid.",
    "And since when have you been interested in simple parlourmaids  not that Betty is simple\n an artful dodger is more like it.",
    "I think said Colonel Race that she might be able to tell me something.",
    "If you asked her nicely I shouldnt be surprised if youre right.",
    "She has the\nclosetothedoorwhentheresanythinginterestinggoingon technique very highly\ndeveloped.",
    "What does M. do\nM. very kindly offers me a drink and rings for Betty and orders it.",
    "And when Betty brings it\n\n\fBy then M. has very kindly gone away.",
    "To do some listening outside the door herself\nIf she likes.",
    "And after that I shall be bursting with Inside Information about the latest European\ncrisis\nIm afraid not.",
    "There is no political situation involved in this.",
    "What a disappointment All right.",
    "Ill play\nMrs ReesTalbot who was a lively nearbrunette of fortynine rang the bell and directed\nher goodlooking parlourmaid to bring Colonel Race a whisky and soda.",
    "When Betty Archdale returned with a salver and the drink upon it Mrs ReesTalbot was\nstanding by the far door into her own sittingroom.",
    "Colonel Race has some questions to ask you she said and went out.",
    "Betty turned her impudent eyes on the tall greyhaired soldier with some alarm in their\ndepths.",
    "He took the glass from the tray and smiled.",
    "Seen the papers today he asked.",
    "Yes sir.",
    "Betty eyed him warily.",
    "Did you see that Mr George Barton died last night at the Luxembourg Restaurant\nOh yes sir.",
    "Bettys eyes sparkled with the pleasure of public disaster.",
    "Wasnt it\ndreadful\nYou were in service there werent you\nYes sir.",
    "I left last winter soon after Mrs Barton died.",
    "She died at the Luxembourg too.",
    "Betty nodded.",
    "Sort of funny that isnt it sir Race did not think it funny but he knew\nwhat the words were intended to convey.",
    "He said gravely\nI see youve got brains.",
    "You can put two and two together.",
    "Betty clasped her hands and cast discretion to the winds.",
    "Was he done in too The papers didnt say exactly\nWhy do you say too Mrs Bartons death was brought in by the coroners jury as\nsuicide.",
    "She gave him a quick look out of the corner of her eye.",
    "Ever so old she thought but hes\nnice looking.",
    "That quiet kind.",
    "A real gentleman.",
    "Sort of gentleman whod have given you a\ngold sovereign when he was young.",
    "Funny I dont even know what a sovereign looks like\nWhats he after exactly\nShe said demurely Yes sir.",
    "But perhaps you never thought it was suicide\nWell no sir.",
    "I didnt  not really.",
    "Thats very interesting  very interesting indeed.",
    "Why didnt you think so\nShe hesitated her fingers began pleating her apron.",
    "Please tell me.",
    "It may be very important.",
    "So nicely he said that so gravely.",
    "Made you feel important and as though you wanted to\nhelp him.",
    "And anyway she had been smart over Rosemary Bartons death.",
    "Never been\ntaken in she hadnt\nShe was done in sir wasnt she\nIt seems possible that it may be so.",
    "But how did you come to think so\nWell Betty hesitated.",
    "It was something I heard one day.",
    "Yes\n\n\fHis tone was quietly encouraging.",
    "The door wasnt shut or anything.",
    "I mean Id never go and listen at a door.",
    "I dont like\nthat sort of thing said Betty virtuously.",
    "But I was going through the hall to the\ndiningroom and carrying the silver on a tray and they were speaking quite loud.",
    "Saying\nsomething she was  Mrs Barton I mean  about Anthony Browne not being his name.",
    "And\nthen he got really nasty Mr Browne did.",
    "I wouldnt have thought he had it in him  so\nnicelooking and so pleasant spoken as he was as a rule.",
    "Said something about carving up\nher face  ooh and then he said if she didnt do what he told her hed bump her off.",
    "Just\nlike that I didnt hear any more because Miss Iris was coming down the stairs and of\ncourse I didnt think very much of it at the time but after there was all the fuss about her\ncommitting suicide at that party and I heard hed been there at the time  well it gave me\nshivers all down my back  it did indeed\nBut you didnt say anything\nThe girl shook her head.",
    "I didnt want to get mixed up with the police  and anyway I didnt know anything  not\nreally.",
    "And perhaps if I had said anything Id have been bumped off too.",
    "Or taken for a\nride as they call it.",
    "I see.",
    "Race paused a moment and then said in his gentlest voice So you just wrote an\nanonymous letter to Mr George Barton\nShe stared at him.",
    "He detected no uneasy guilt  nothing but pure astonishment.",
    "Me Write to Mr Barton Never.",
    "Now dont be afraid to tell about it.",
    "It was really a very good idea.",
    "It warned him without\nyour having to give yourself away.",
    "It was very clever of you.",
    "But I didnt sir.",
    "I never thought of such a thing.",
    "You mean write to Mr Barton and say\nthat his wife had been done in Why the idea never came into my head\nShe was so earnest in her denial that in spite of himself Race was shaken.",
    "But if all fitted\nin so well  it could all be explained so naturally if only the girl had written the letters.",
    "But\nshe persisted in her denials not vehemently nor uneasily but soberly and without undue\nprotestation.",
    "He found himself reluctantly believing her.",
    "He shifted his ground.",
    "Whom did you tell about this\nShe shook her head.",
    "I didnt tell anyone.",
    "Ill tell you honest sir I was scared.",
    "I thought Id better keep my\nmouth shut.",
    "I tried to forget it.",
    "I only brought it up once  that was when I gave Mrs Drake\nmy notice  fussing terribly shed been more than a girl could stand and now wanting me\nto go and bury myself in the dead of the country and not even a bus route And then she\nturned nasty about my reference saying I broke things and I said sarcasticlike that at any\nrate Id find a place where people didnt get bumped off  and I felt scared when Id said it\nbut she didnt pay any real attention.",
    "Perhaps I ought to have spoken out at the time but I\ncouldnt really tell.",
    "I mean the whole thing might have been a joke.",
    "People do say all sorts\nof things and Mr Browne was ever so nice really and quite a one for joking so I couldnt\ntell sir could I\nRace agreed that she couldnt.",
    "Then he said\nMrs Barton spoke of Browne not being his real name.",
    "Did she mention what his real name\nwas\nYes she did.",
    "Because he said Forget about Tony  now what was it Tony something...",
    "Reminded me of the cherry jam cook had been making.",
    "Tony Cheriton Cherable.",
    "She shook her head.",
    "More of a fancy name than that.",
    "Began with an M. And sounded foreign.",
    "Dont worry.",
    "It will come back to you perhaps.",
    "If so let me know.",
    "Here is my card with\nmy address.",
    "If you remember the name write to me to that address.",
    "He handed her the card and a treasury note.",
    "I will sir thank you sir.",
    "A gentleman she thought as she ran downstairs.",
    "A pound note not ten shillings.",
    "It must\nhave been nice when there were gold sovereigns...\nMary ReesTalbot came back into the room.",
    "Well successful\nYes but theres still one snag to surmount.",
    "Can your ingenuity help me Can you think of\na name that would remind you of cherry jam\nWhat an extraordinary proposition.",
    "Think Mary.",
    "Im not a domestic man.",
    "Concentrate on jam making cherry jam in\nparticular.",
    "One doesnt often make cherry jam.",
    "Why not\nWell its inclined to go very sugary  unless you use cooking cherries Morello cherries.",
    "Thats it  I bet thats it.",
    "Goodbye Mary Im endlessly grateful.",
    "Do you mind if I ring\nthat bell so that the girl comes and shows me out\nMrs ReesTalbot called after him as he hurried out of the room\nOf all the ungrateful wretches Arent you going to tell me what its all about\nHe called back Ill come and tell you the whole story later.",
    "Sez you murmured Mrs ReesTalbot.",
    "Downstairs Betty waited with Races hat and stick.",
    "He thanked her and passed out.",
    "On the doorstep he paused.",
    "By the way he said was the name Morelli\nBettys face lighted up.",
    "Quite right sir.",
    "That was it.",
    "Tony Morelli thats the name he told her to forget.",
    "And he\nsaid hed been in prison too.",
    "Race walked down the steps smiling.",
    "From the nearest callbox he put through a call to Kemp.",
    "Their interchange was brief but satisfactory.",
    "Kemp said Ill send off a cable at once.",
    "We ought to hear by return.",
    "I must say it will be a\ngreat relief if youre right.",
    "I think Im right.",
    "The sequence is pretty clear.",
    "Chapter 8\nChief Inspector Kemp was not in a very good humour.",
    "For the last halfhour he had been interviewing a frightened white rabbit of sixteen who by\nvirtue of his uncle Charless great position was aspiring to be a waiter of the class required\nby the Luxembourg.",
    "In the meantime he was one of six harried underlings who ran about\nwith aprons round their waists to distinguish them from the superior article and whose\n\n\fduty it was to bear the blame for everything fetch and carry provide rolls and pats of\nbutter and be occasionally and unceasingly hissed at in French Italian and occasionally\nEnglish.",
    "Charles as befitted a great man so far from showing favour to a blood relation\nhissed cursed and swore at him even more than he did at the others.",
    "Nevertheless Pierre\naspired in his heart to be no less than the head waiter of a chic restaurant himself one day\nin the far future.",
    "At the moment however his career had received a check and he gathered that he was\nsuspected of no less than murder.",
    "Kemp turned the lad inside out and disgustedly convinced himself that the boy had done no\nless and no more than what he had said  namely picked up a ladys bag from the floor and\nreplaced it by her plate.",
    "It is as I am hurrying with sauce to M. Robert and already he is impatient and the young\nlady sweeps her bag off the table as she goes to dance so I pick it up and put it on the table\nand then I hurry on for already M. Robert he is making the signs frantically to me.",
    "That is\nall monsieur.",
    "And that was all.",
    "Kemp disgustedly let him go feeling strongly tempted to add But dont\nlet me catch you doing that sort of thing again.",
    "Sergeant Pollock made a distraction by announcing that they had telephoned up to say that\na young lady was asking for him or rather for the officer in charge of the Luxembourg\ncase.",
    "Who is she\nHer name is Miss Chloe West.",
    "Lets have her up said Kemp resignedly.",
    "I can give her ten minutes.",
    "Mr Farradays due\nafter that.",
    "Oh well wont do any harm to keep him waiting a few minutes.",
    "Makes them\njittery that does.",
    "When Miss Chloe West walked into the room Kemp was at once assailed by the impression\nthat he recognised her.",
    "But a minute later he abandoned that impression.",
    "No he had never seen this girl before he was sure of that.",
    "Nevertheless the vague haunting\nsense of familiarity remained to plague him.",
    "Miss West was about twentyfive tall brownhaired and very pretty.",
    "Her voice was rather\nconscious of its diction and she seemed decidedly nervous.",
    "Well Miss West what can I do for you Kemp spoke briskly.",
    "I read in the paper about the Luxembourg  the man who died there.",
    "Mr George Barton Yes Did you know him\nWell no not exactly.",
    "I mean I didnt really know him.",
    "Kemp looked at her carefully and discarded his first deduction.",
    "Chloe West was looking extremely refined and virtuous  severely so.",
    "He said pleasantly\nCan I have your exact name and address first please so that we know where we are\nChloe Elizabeth West.",
    "15 Merryvale Court Maida Vale.",
    "Im an actress.",
    "Kemp looked at her again out of the corner of his eye and decided that that was what she\nreally was.",
    "Repertory he fancied  in spite of her looks she was the earnest kind.",
    "Yes Miss West\nWhen I read about Mr Bartons death and that the  the police were inquiring into it I\nthought perhaps I ought to come and tell you something.",
    "I spoke to my friend about it and\nshe seemed to think so.",
    "I dont suppose its really anything to do with it but \nMiss West paused.",
    "Well be the judge of that said Kemp pleasantly.",
    "Just tell me about it.",
    "Im not acting just at the moment explained Miss West.",
    "Inspector Kemp nearly said Resting to show that he knew the proper terms but\nrestrained himself.",
    "But my name is down at the agencies and my picture in Spotlight... That I understand is\nwhere Mr Barton saw it.",
    "He got into touch with me and explained what he wanted me to\ndo.",
    "Yes\nHe told me he was having a dinner party at the Luxembourg and that he wanted to spring\na surprise on his guests.",
    "He showed me a photograph and told me that he wanted me to\nmake up as the original.",
    "I was very much the same colouring he said.",
    "Illumination flashed across Kemps mind.",
    "The photograph of Rosemary he had seen on the\ndesk in Georges room in Elvaston Square.",
    "That was who the girl had reminded him of.",
    "She was like Rosemary Barton  not perhaps startlingly so  but the general type and cast of\nfeatures was the same.",
    "He also brought me a dress to wear  Ive brought it with me.",
    "A greyish green silk.",
    "I was\nto do my hair like the photograph it was a coloured one and accentuate the resemblance\nwith makeup.",
    "Then I was to come to the Luxembourg and go into the restaurant during\nthe first cabaret show and sit down at Mr Bartons table where there would be a vacant\nplace.",
    "He took me to lunch there and showed me where the table would be.",
    "And why didnt you keep the appointment Miss West\nBecause about eight oclock that night  someone  Mr Barton  rang up and said the\nwhole thing had been put off.",
    "He said hed let me know next day when it was coming off.",
    "Then the next morning I saw his death in the papers.",
    "And very sensibly you came along to us said Kemp pleasantly.",
    "Well thank you very\nmuch Miss West.",
    "Youve cleared up one mystery  the mystery of the vacant place.",
    "By the\nway you said just now  someone  and then Mr Barton.",
    "Why is that\nBecause at first I didnt think it was Mr Barton.",
    "His voice sounded different.",
    "It was a mans voice\nOh yes I think so  at least  it was rather husky as though he had a cold.",
    "And thats all he said\nThats all.",
    "Kemp questioned her a little longer but got no further.",
    "When she had gone he said to the sergeant So that was George Bartons famous plan.",
    "I\nsee now why they all said he stared at the empty chair after the cabaret and looked queer\nand absentminded.",
    "His precious plan had gone wrong.",
    "You dont think it was he who put her off\nNot on your life.",
    "And Im not so sure it was a mans voice either.",
    "Huskiness is a good\ndisguise through the telephone.",
    "Oh well were getting on.",
    "Send in Mr Farraday if hes\nhere.",
    "Chapter 9\nOutwardly cool and unperturbed Stephen Farraday had turned into Great Scotland Yard\nfull of inner shrinking.",
    "An intolerable weight burdened his spirits.",
    "It had seemed that\nmorning as though things were going so well.",
    "Why had Inspector Kemp asked for his\n\n\fpresence here with such significance What did he know or suspect It could be only vague\nsuspicion.",
    "The thing to do was to keep ones head and admit nothing.",
    "He felt strangely bereft and lonely without Sandra.",
    "It was as though when the two faced a\nperil together it lost half its terrors.",
    "Together they had strength courage power.",
    "Alone he\nwas nothing less than nothing.",
    "And Sandra did she feel the same Was she sitting now in\nKidderminster House silent reserved proud and inwardly feeling horribly vulnerable\nInspector Kemp received him pleasantly but gravely.",
    "There was a uniformed man sitting at\na table with a pencil and a pad of paper.",
    "Having asked Stephen to sit down Kemp spoke in\na strongly formal manner.",
    "I propose Mr Farraday to take a statement from you.",
    "That statement will be written\ndown and you will be asked to read it over and sign it before you leave.",
    "At the same time it\nis my duty to tell you that you are at liberty to refuse to make such a statement and that\nyou are entitled to have your solicitor present if you so desire.",
    "Stephen was taken aback but did not show it.",
    "He forced a watery smile.",
    "That sounds very\nformidable Chief Inspector.",
    "We like everything to be clearly understood Mr Farraday.",
    "Anything I say may be used against me is that it\nWe dont use the word against.",
    "Anything you say will be liable to be used in evidence.",
    "Stephen said quietly I understand but I cannot imagine Inspector why you should need\nany further statement from me You heard all I had to say this morning.",
    "That was a rather informal session  useful as a preliminary startingoff point.",
    "And also\nMr Farraday there are certain facts which I imagined you would prefer to discuss with me\nhere.",
    "Anything irrelevant to the case we try to be as discreet about as is compatible with the\nattainment of justice.",
    "I daresay you understand what I am driving at.",
    "Im afraid I dont.",
    "Chief Inspector Kemp sighed.",
    "Just this.",
    "You were on very intimate terms with the late Mrs Rosemary Barton \nStephen interrupted him.",
    "Who says so\nKemp leaned forward and took a typewritten document from his desk.",
    "This is a copy of a letter found amongst the late Mrs Bartons belongings.",
    "The original is\nfiled here and handed to us by Miss Iris Marle who recognises the writing as that of her\nsister.",
    "Stephen read Leopard darling \nA wave of sickness passed over him.",
    "Rosemarys voice... speaking  pleading... Would the past never die  never consent to be\nburied\nHe pulled himself together and looked at Kemp.",
    "You may be correct in thinking Mrs Barton wrote this letter  but there is nothing to\nindicate that it was written to me.",
    "Do you deny that you paid the rent of 21 Malland Mansions Earls Court\nSo they knew He wondered if they had known all the time.",
    "He shrugged his shoulders.",
    "You seem very well informed.",
    "May I ask why my private affairs should be dragged into\nthe limelight\nThey will not unless they prove to be relevant to the death of George Barton.",
    "I see.",
    "You are suggesting that I first made love to his wife and then murdered him.",
    "Come Mr Farraday Ill be frank with you.",
    "You and Mrs Barton were very close friends you parted by your wish not the ladys.",
    "She was proposing as this letter shows to make\ntrouble.",
    "Very conveniently she died.",
    "She committed suicide.",
    "I daresay I may have been partly to blame.",
    "I may reproach myself\nbut it is no concern of the laws.",
    "It may have been suicide  it may not.",
    "George Barton thought not.",
    "He started to\ninvestigate  and he died.",
    "The sequence is rather suggestive.",
    "I do not see why you should  well pitch on me.",
    "You admit that Mrs Bartons death came at a very convenient moment for you A\nscandal Mr Farraday would have been highly prejudicial to your career.",
    "There would have been no scandal.",
    "Mrs Barton would have seen reason.",
    "I wonder Did your wife know about this affair Mr Farraday\nCertainly not.",
    "You are quite sure of that statement\nYes I am.",
    "My wife has no idea that there was anything but friendship between myself and\nMrs Barton.",
    "I hope she will never learn otherwise.",
    "Is your wife a jealous woman Mr Farraday\nNot at all.",
    "She has never displayed the least jealousy where I am concerned.",
    "She is far too\nsensible.",
    "The inspector did not comment on that.",
    "Instead he said Have you at any time in the past year had cyanide in your possession Mr\nFarraday\nNo.",
    "But you keep a supply of cyanide at your country property\nThe gardener may.",
    "I know nothing about it.",
    "You have never purchased any yourself at a chemists or for photography\nI know nothing of photography and I repeat that I have never purchased cyanide.",
    "Kemp pressed him a little further before he finally let him go.",
    "To his subordinate he said thoughtfully\nHe was very quick denying that his wife knew about his affair with the Barton woman.",
    "Why was that I wonder\nDaresay hes in a funk in case she should get to hear of it sir.",
    "That may be but I should have thought hed got the brains to see that if his wife was in\nignorance and would cut up rough that gives him an additional motive for wanting to\nsilence Rosemary Barton.",
    "To save his skin his line ought to have been that his wife more or\nless knew about the affair but was content to ignore it.",
    "I daresay he hadnt thought of that sir.",
    "Kemp shook his head.",
    "Stephen Farraday was not a fool.",
    "He had a clear and astute brain.",
    "And he had been passionately keen to impress on the inspector that Sandra knew nothing.",
    "Well said Kemp Colonel Race seems pleased with the line hes dug up and if hes right\nthe Farradays are out  both of them.",
    "I shall be glad if they are.",
    "I like this chap.",
    "And\npersonally I dont think hes a murderer.",
    "Opening the door of their sittingroom Stephen said Sandra\nShe came to him out of the darkness suddenly holding him her hands on his shoulders.",
    "Stephen\n\n\fWhy are you all in the dark\nI couldnt bear the light.",
    "Tell me.",
    "He said They know.",
    "About Rosemary\nYes.",
    "And what do they think\nThey see of course that I had a motive... Oh my darling see what Ive dragged you into.",
    "Its all my fault.",
    "If only Id cut loose after Rosemarys death  gone away  left you free  so\nthat at any rate you shouldnt be mixed up in all this horrible business.",
    "No not that... Never leave me... never leave me.",
    "She clung to him  she was crying the tears coursing down her cheeks.",
    "He felt her shudder.",
    "Youre my life Stephen all my life  never leave me...\nDo you care so much Sandra I never knew...",
    "I didnt want you to know.",
    "But now \nYes now...",
    "Were in this together Sandra... well face it together... whatever comes\ntogether\nStrength came to them as they stood there clasped together in the darkness.",
    "Sandra said with determination This shall not wreck our lives It shall not.",
    "It shall not\nChapter 10\nAnthony Browne looked at the card the little page was holding out to him.",
    "He frowned then shrugged his shoulders.",
    "He said to the boy All right show him up.",
    "When Colonel Race came in Anthony was standing by the window with the bright sun\nstriking obliquely over his shoulder.",
    "He saw a tall soldierly man with a lined bronze face\nand irongrey hair  a man whom he had seen before but not for some years and a man\nwhom he knew a good deal about.",
    "Race saw a dark graceful figure and the outline of a\nwellshaped head.",
    "A pleasant indolent voice said\nColonel Race You were a friend of George Bartons I know.",
    "He talked about you on that\nlast evening.",
    "Have a cigarette.",
    "Thank you I will.",
    "Anthony said as he held a match\nYou were the unexpected guest that night who did not turn up  just as well for you.",
    "You are wrong there.",
    "That empty place was not for me.",
    "Anthonys eyebrows went up.",
    "Really Barton said \nRace cut in.",
    "George Barton may have said so.",
    "His plans were quite different.",
    "That chair Mr Browne\nwas intended to be occupied when the lights went down by an actress called Chloe West.",
    "Anthony stared.",
    "Chloe West Never heard of her.",
    "Who is she\nA young actress not very well known but who possesses a certain superficial resemblance\nto Rosemary Barton.",
    "Anthony whistled.",
    "I begin to see.",
    "She had been given a photograph of Rosemary so that she could copy the style of\nhairdressing and she also had the dress which Rosemary wore the night she died.",
    "So that was Georges plan Up go the lights  Hey Presto gasps of supernatural dread\nRosemary has come back.",
    "The guilty party gasps out Its true  its true  I dunnit.",
    "He paused and added Rotten even for an ass like poor old George.",
    "Im not sure I understand you.",
    "Anthony grinned.",
    "Oh come now sir  a hardened criminal isnt going to behave like a hysterical schoolgirl.",
    "If somebody poisoned Rosemary Barton in cold blood and was preparing to administer the\nsame fatal dose of cyanide to George Barton that person had a certain amount of nerve.",
    "It\nwould take more than an actress dressed up as Rosemary to make him or her spill the\nbeans.",
    "Macbeth remember a decidedly hardened criminal went to pieces when he saw the ghost\nof Banquo at the feast.",
    "Ah but what Macbeth saw really was a ghost It wasnt a ham actor wearing Banquos\nduds Im prepared to admit that a real ghost might bring its own atmosphere from\nanother world.",
    "In fact I am willing to admit that I believe in ghosts  have believed in them\nfor the last six months  one ghost in particular.",
    "Really  and whose ghost is that\nRosemary Bartons.",
    "You can laugh if you like.",
    "Ive not seen her  but Ive felt her\npresence.",
    "For some reason or other Rosemary poor soul cant stay dead.",
    "I could suggest a reason.",
    "Because she was murdered\nTo put it in another idiom because she was bumped off.",
    "How about that Mr Tony\nMorelli\nThere was a silence.",
    "Anthony sat down chucked his cigarette into the grate and lighted\nanother one.",
    "Then he said How did you find out\nYou admit that you are Tony Morelli\nI shouldnt dream of wasting time by denying it.",
    "Youve obviously cabled to America and\ngot all the dope.",
    "And you admit that when Rosemary Barton discovered your identity you threatened to\nbump her off unless she held her tongue.",
    "I did everything I could think of to scare her into holding her tongue agreed Tony\npleasantly.",
    "A strange feeling stole over Colonel Race.",
    "This interview was not going as it should.",
    "He stared at the figure in front of him lounging\nback in its chair  and an odd sense of familiarity came to him.",
    "Shall I recapitulate what I know about you Morelli\nIt might be amusing.",
    "You were convicted in the States of attempted sabotage in the Ericsen aeroplane works\nand were sentenced to a term of imprisonment.",
    "After serving your sentence you came out\nand the authorities lost sight of you.",
    "You were next heard of in London staying at\nClaridges and calling yourself Anthony Browne.",
    "There you scraped acquaintance with\nLord Dewsbury and through him you met certain other prominent armaments\nmanufacturers.",
    "You stayed in Lord Dewsburys house and by means of your position as his\n\n\fguest you were shown things which you ought never to have seen It is a curious\ncoincidence Morelli that a trail of unaccountable accidents and some very near escapes\nfrom disaster on a large scale followed very closely after your visits to various important\nworks and factories.",
    "Coincidences said Anthony are certainly extraordinary things.",
    "Finally after another lapse of time you reappeared in London and renewed your\nacquaintance with Iris Marle making excuses not to visit her home so that her family\nshould not realise how intimate you were becoming.",
    "Finally you tried to induce her to\nmarry you secretly.",
    "You know said Anthony its really extraordinary the way you have found out all these\nthings  I dont mean the armaments business  I mean my threats to Rosemary and the\ntender nothings I whispered to Iris.",
    "Surely those dont come within the province of the\nlaw\nRace looked sharply at him.",
    "Youve a good deal to explain Morelli.",
    "Not at all.",
    "Granted your facts are all correct what of them Ive served my prison\nsentence.",
    "Ive made some interesting friends.",
    "Ive fallen in love with a very charming girl\nand am naturally impatient to marry her.",
    "So impatient that you would prefer the wedding to take place before her family have the\nchance of finding out anything about your antecedents.",
    "Iris Marle is a very rich young\nwoman.",
    "Anthony nodded his head agreeably.",
    "I know.",
    "When theres money families are inclined to be abominably nosy.",
    "And Iris you\nsee doesnt know anything about my murky past.",
    "Frankly Id rather she didnt.",
    "Im afraid she is going to know all about it.",
    "A pity said Anthony.",
    "Possibly you dont realise \nAnthony cut in with a laugh.",
    "Oh I can dot the is and cross the ts.",
    "Rosemary Barton knew my criminal past so I killed\nher.",
    "George Barton was growing suspicious of me so I killed him Now Im after Iriss\nmoney Its all very agreeable and it hangs together nicely but you havent got a mite of\nproof.",
    "Race looked at him attentively for some minutes.",
    "Then he got up.",
    "Everything I have said is true he said.",
    "And its all wrong.",
    "Anthony watched him narrowly.",
    "Whats wrong\nYoure wrong.",
    "Race walked slowly up and down the room.",
    "It hung together all right\nuntil I saw you  but now Ive seen you it wont do.",
    "Youre not a crook.",
    "And if youre not a\ncrook youre one of our kind.",
    "Im right arent I\nAnthony looked at him in silence while a smile slowly broadened on his face.",
    "Then he\nhummed softly under his breath.",
    "For the Colonels lady and Judy OGrady are sisters under the skin.",
    "Yes funny how one\nknows ones own kind.",
    "Thats why Ive tried to avoid meeting you.",
    "I was afraid youd spot\nme for what I am.",
    "It was important then that nobody should know  important up to\nyesterday.",
    "Now thank goodness the balloons gone up Weve swept our gang of\ninternational saboteurs into the net.",
    "Ive been working on this assignment for three years.",
    "Frequenting certain meetings agitating among workmen getting myself the right\n\n\freputation.",
    "Finally it was fixed that I pulled an important job and got sentenced.",
    "The\nbusiness had to be genuine if I was to establish my bona fides.",
    "When I came out things began to move.",
    "Little by little I got further into the centre of\nthings  a great international net run from Central Europe.",
    "It was as their agent I came to\nLondon and went to Claridges.",
    "I had orders to get on friendly terms with Lord Dewsbury that was my lay the social butterfly I got to know Rosemary Barton in my character of\nattractive young man about town.",
    "Suddenly to my horror I found that she knew I had\nbeen in prison in America as Tony Morelli.",
    "I was terrified for her The people I was\nworking with would have had her killed without a moments hesitation if they had thought\nshe knew that.",
    "I did my best to scare her into keeping her mouth shut but I wasnt very\nhopeful.",
    "Rosemary was born to be indiscreet.",
    "I thought the best thing I could do was to\nsheer off  and then I saw Iris coming down a staircase and I swore that after my job was\ndone I would come back and marry her.",
    "When the active part of my work was over I turned up again and got into touch with Iris\nbut I kept aloof from the house and her people for I knew theyd want to make inquiries\nabout me and I had to keep under cover for a bit longer.",
    "But I got worried about her.",
    "She\nlooked ill and afraid  and George Barton seemed to be behaving in a very odd fashion.",
    "I\nurged her to come away and marry me.",
    "Well she refused.",
    "Perhaps she was right.",
    "And then\nI was roped in for this party.",
    "It was as we sat down to dinner that George mention you\nwere to be there.",
    "I said rather quickly that Id met a man I knew and might have to leave\nearly.",
    "Actually I had seen a fellow I knew in America  Monkey Coleman  though he didnt\nremember me  but I really wanted to avoid meeting you.",
    "I was still on my job.",
    "You know what happened next  George died.",
    "I had nothing to do with his death or with\nRosemarys.",
    "I dont know now who did kill them.",
    "Not even an idea\nIt must have been either the waiter or one of the five people round the table.",
    "I dont think\nit was the waiter.",
    "It wasnt me and it wasnt Iris.",
    "It could have been Sandra Farraday or it\ncould have been Stephen Farraday or it could have been both of them together.",
    "But the\nbest bet in my opinion is Ruth Lessing.",
    "Have you anything to support that belief\nNo.",
    "She seems to me the most likely person  but I dont see in the least how she did it In\nboth tragedies she was so placed at the table that it would be practically impossible for her\nto tamper with the champagne glass  and the more I think over what happened the other\nnight the more it seems to me impossible that George could have been poisoned at all  and\nyet he was Anthony paused.",
    "And theres another thing that gets me  have you found\nout who wrote those anonymous letters that started him on the track\nRace shook his head.",
    "No.",
    "I thought I had  but I was wrong.",
    "Because the interesting thing is that it means that there is someone somewhere who\nknows that Rosemary was murdered so that unless youre careful  that person will be\nmurdered next\nChapter 11\nFrom information received over the telephone Anthony knew that Lucilla Drake was going\nout at five oclock to drink a cup of tea with a dear old friend.",
    "Allowing for possible contingencies returning for a purse determination after all to take\nan umbrella just in case and lastminute chats on the doorstep Anthony timed his own\narrival at Elvaston Square at precisely twentyfive minutes past five.",
    "It was Iris he wanted\nto see not her aunt.",
    "And by all accounts once shown into Lucillas presence he would have\nhad very little chance of uninterrupted conversation with his lady.",
    "He was told by the parlourmaid a girl lacking the impudent polish of Betty Archdale that\nMiss Iris had just come in and was in the study.",
    "Anthony said with a smile Dont bother.",
    "Ill find my way and went past her and along\nto the study door.",
    "Iris spun round at his entrance with a nervous start.",
    "Oh its you.",
    "He came over to her swiftly.",
    "Whats the matter darling\nNothing.",
    "She paused then said quickly Nothing.",
    "Only I was nearly run over.",
    "Oh my\nown fault I expect I was thinking so hard and mooning across the road without looking\nand the car came tearing round the corner and just missed me.",
    "He gave her a gentle little shake.",
    "You mustnt do that sort of thing Iris.",
    "Im worried about you  oh not about your\nmiraculous escape from under the wheels of a car but about the reason that lets you moon\nabout in the midst of traffic.",
    "What is it darling Theres something special isnt there\nShe nodded.",
    "Her eyes raised mournfully to his were large and dark with fear.",
    "He\nrecognised their message even before she said very low and quick Im afraid.",
    "Anthony recovered his calm smiling poise.",
    "He sat down beside Iris on a wide settee.",
    "Come on he said lets have it.",
    "I dont think I want to tell you Anthony.",
    "Now then funny dont be like the heroines of thirdrate thrillers who start in the very\nfirst chapter by having something they cant possibly tell for no real reason except to gum\nup the hero and make the book spin itself out for another fifty thousand words.",
    "She gave a faint pale smile.",
    "I want to tell you Anthony but I dont know what youd think  I dont know if youd\nbelieve \nAnthony raised a hand and began to check off the fingers.",
    "One an illegitimate baby.",
    "Two a blackmailing lover.",
    "Three \nShe interrupted him indignantly Of course not.",
    "Nothing of that kind.",
    "You relieve my mind said Anthony.",
    "Come on little idiot.",
    "Iriss face clouded over again.",
    "Its nothing to laugh at.",
    "Its  its about the other night.",
    "Yes His voice sharpened.",
    "Iris said You were at the inquest this morning  you heard \nShe paused.",
    "Very little said Anthony.",
    "The police surgeon being technical about cyanides generally\nand the effect of potassium cyanide on George and the police evidence as given by that first\ninspector not Kemp the one with the smart moustache who arrived first at the\nLuxembourg and took charge.",
    "Identification of the body by Georges chief clerk.",
    "The\ninquest was then adjourned for a week by a properly docile coroner.",
    "Its the Inspector I mean said Iris.",
    "He described finding a small paper packet under\n\n\fthe table containing traces of potassium cyanide.",
    "Anthony looked interested.",
    "Yes.",
    "Obviously whoever slipped that stuff into Georges glass just dropped the paper that\nhad contained it under the table.",
    "Simplest thing to do.",
    "Couldnt risk having it found on him\n or her.",
    "To his surprise Iris began to tremble violently.",
    "Oh no Anthony.",
    "Oh no it wasnt like that.",
    "What do you mean darling What do you know about it\nIris said I dropped that packet under the table.",
    "He turned astonished eyes upon her.",
    "Listen Anthony.",
    "You remember how George drank off that champagne and then it\nhappened\nHe nodded.",
    "It was awful  like a bad dream.",
    "Coming just when everything had seemed to be all right.",
    "I\nmean that after the cabaret when the lights went up  I felt so relieved.",
    "Because it was\nthen you know that we found Rosemary dead  and somehow I dont know why I felt Id\nsee it all happen again...",
    "I felt she was there dead at the table...",
    "Darling...\nOh I know.",
    "It was just nerves.",
    "But anyway there we were and there was nothing awful\nand suddenly it seemed the whole thing was really done with at last and one could  I dont\nknow how to explain it  begin again.",
    "And so I danced with George and really felt I was\nenjoying myself at last and we came back to the table.",
    "And then George suddenly talked\nabout Rosemary and asked us to drink to her memory and then he died and all the\nnightmare had come back.",
    "I just felt paralysed I think.",
    "I stood there shaking.",
    "You came\nround to look at him and I moved back a little and the waiters came and some asked for a\ndoctor.",
    "And all the time I was standing there frozen.",
    "Then suddenly a big lump came in my\nthroat and tears began to run down my cheeks and I jerked open my bag to get my\nhandkerchief.",
    "I just fumbled in it not seeing properly and got out my handkerchief but\nthere was something caught up inside the handkerchief  a folded stiff bit of white paper\nlike the kind you get powders in from the chemist.",
    "Only you see Anthony it hadnt been in\nmy bag when I started from home.",
    "I hadnt had anything like that Id put the things in\nmyself when the bag was quite empty  a powder compact a lipstick my handkerchief my\nevening comb in its case and a shilling and a couple of sixpences.",
    "Somebody had put that\npacket in my bag  they must have done.",
    "And I remembered how theyd found a packet like\nthat in Rosemarys bag after she died and how it had had cyanide in it.",
    "I was frightened\nAnthony I was horribly frightened.",
    "My fingers went limp and the packet fluttered down\nfrom the handkerchief under the table.",
    "I let it go.",
    "And I didnt say anything.",
    "I was too\nfrightened.",
    "Somebody meant it to look as though I had killed George and I didnt.",
    "Anthony gave vent to a long and prolonged whistle.",
    "And nobody saw you he said.",
    "Iris hesitated.",
    "Im not sure she said slowly.",
    "I believe Ruth noticed.",
    "But she was looking so dazed that\nI dont know whether she really noticed  or if she was just staring at me blankly.",
    "Anthony gave another whistle.",
    "This he remarked is a pretty kettle of fish.",
    "Iris said Its got worse and worse.",
    "Ive been so afraid theyd find out.",
    "Why werent your fingerprints on it I wonder The first thing theyd do would be to\nfingerprint it.",
    "I suppose it was because I was holding it through the handkerchief.",
    "Anthony nodded.",
    "Yes you had luck there.",
    "But who could have put it in my bag I had my bag with me all the evening.",
    "Thats not so impossible as you think.",
    "When you went to dance after the cabaret you left\nyour bag on the table.",
    "Somebody may have tampered with it then.",
    "And there are the\nwomen.",
    "Could you get up and give me an imitation of just how a woman behaves in the\nladies cloakroom Its the sort of thing I wouldnt know.",
    "Do you congregate and chat or do\nyou drift off to different mirrors\nIris considered.",
    "We all went to the same table  a great long glasstopped one.",
    "And we put our bags down\nand looked at our faces you know.",
    "Actually I dont.",
    "Go on.",
    "Ruth powdered her nose and Sandra patted her hair and pushed a hairpin in and I took\noff my fox cape and gave it to the woman and then I saw Id got some dirt on my hand  a\nsmear of mud and I went over to the washbasins.",
    "Leaving your bag on the glass table\nYes.",
    "And I washed my hands.",
    "Ruth was still fixing her face I think and Sandra went and\ngave up her cloak and then she went back to the glass and Ruth came and washed her\nhands and I went back to the table and just fixed my hair a little.",
    "So either of those two could have put something in your bag without your seeing\nYes but I cant believe either Ruth or Sandra would do such a thing.",
    "You think too highly of people.",
    "Sandra is the kind of Gothic creature who would have\nburned her enemies at the stake in the Middle Ages  and Ruth would make the most\ndevastatingly practical poisoner that ever stepped this earth.",
    "If it was Ruth why didnt she say she saw me drop it\nYou have me there.",
    "If Ruth deliberately planted cyanide on you shed take jolly good care\nyou didnt get rid of it.",
    "So it looks as though it wasnt Ruth.",
    "In fact the waiter is far and\naway the best bet.",
    "The waiter the waiter If only we had a strange waiter a peculiar\nwaiter a waiter hired for that evening only.",
    "But instead we have Giuseppe and Pierre and\nthey just dont fit...\nIris sighed.",
    "Im glad Ive told you No one will ever know now will they Only you and I\nAnthony looked at her with a rather embarrassed expression.",
    "Its not going to be just like that Iris.",
    "In fact youre coming with me now in a taxi to old\nman Kemp.",
    "We cant keep this under our hats.",
    "Oh no Anthony.",
    "Theyll think I killed George.",
    "Theyll certainly think so if they find out later that you sat tight and said nothing about all\nthis Your explanation will then sound extremely thin.",
    "If you volunteer it now theres a\nlikelihood of its being believed.",
    "Please Anthony.",
    "Look here Iris youre in a tight place.",
    "But apart from anything else theres such a thing\nas truth.",
    "You cant play safe and take care of your own skin when its a question of\njustice.",
    "Oh Anthony must you be so grand\nThat said Anthony was a very shrewd blow But all the same were going to Kemp\nNow\nUnwillingly she came with him out into the hall.",
    "Her coat was lying tossed on a chair and\nhe took it and held it out for her to put on.",
    "There was both mutiny and fear in her eyes but Anthony showed no sign of relenting.",
    "He\nsaid\nWell pick up a taxi at the end of the Square.",
    "As they went towards the hall door the bell was pressed and they heard it ringing in the\nbasement below.",
    "Iris gave an exclamation.",
    "I forgot.",
    "Its Ruth.",
    "She was coming here when she left the office to settle about the funeral\narrangements.",
    "Its to be the day after tomorrow.",
    "I thought we could settle things better\nwhile Aunt Lucilla was out.",
    "She does confuse things so.",
    "Anthony stepped forward and opened the door forestalling the parlourmaid who came\nrunning up the stairs from below.",
    "Its all right Evans said Iris and the girl went down again.",
    "Ruth was looking tired and rather dishevelled.",
    "She was carrying a largesized attache case.",
    "Im sorry Im late but the tubewas so terribly crowded tonight and then I had to wait for\nthree buses and not a taxi in sight.",
    "It was thought Anthony unlike the efficient Ruth to apologise.",
    "Another sign that Georges\ndeath had succeeded in shattering that almost inhuman efficiency.",
    "Iris said I cant come with you now Anthony.",
    "Ruth and I must settle things.",
    "Anthony said firmly Im afraid this is more important... Im awfully sorry Miss Lessing\nto drag Iris off like this but it really is important.",
    "Ruth said quickly Thats quite all right Mr Browne.",
    "I can arrange everything with Mrs\nDrake when she comes in.",
    "She smiled faintly.",
    "I can really manage her quite well you\nknow.",
    "Im sure you could manage anyone Miss Lessing said Anthony admiringly.",
    "Perhaps Iris if you can tell me any special points\nThere arent any.",
    "I suggested arranging this together because Aunt Lucilla changes her\nmind about everything every two minutes and I thought it would be rather hard on you.",
    "Youve had so much to do.",
    "But I really dont care what sort of funeral it is Aunt Lucilla\nlikes funerals but I hate them.",
    "Youve got to bury people but I hate making a fuss about it.",
    "It cant matter to the people themselves.",
    "Theyve got away from it all.",
    "The dead dont come\nback.",
    "Ruth did not answer and Iris repeated with a strange defiant insistence The dead dont\ncome back\nCome on said Anthony and pulled her out through the open door.",
    "A cruising taxi was coming slowly along the Square.",
    "Anthony hailed it and helped Iris in.",
    "Tell me beautiful he said after he had directed the driver to go to Scotland Yard.",
    "Who\nexactly did you feel was there in the hall when you found it so necessary to affirm that the\ndead are dead Was it George or Rosemary\nNobody Nobody at all I just hate funerals I tell you.",
    "Anthony sighed.",
    "Definitely he said I must be psychic\n\n\fChapter 12\nThree men sat at a small round marbletopped table.",
    "Colonel Race and Chief Inspector Kemp were drinking cups of dark brown tea rich in\ntannin.",
    "Anthony was drinking an English caf\u00e9s idea of a nice cup of coffee.",
    "It was not\nAnthonys idea but he endured it for the sake of being admitted on equal terms to the\nother two mens conference.",
    "Chief Inspector Kemp having painstakingly verified\nAnthonys credentials had consented to recognise him as a colleague.",
    "If you ask me said the Chief Inspector dropping several lumps of sugar into his black\nbrew and stirring it this case will never be brought to trial.",
    "Well never get the evidence.",
    "You think not asked Race.",
    "Kemp shook his head and took an approving sip of his tea.",
    "The only hope was to get evidence concerning the actual purchasing or handling of\ncyanide by one of those five.",
    "Ive drawn a blank everywhere.",
    "Itll be one of those cases\nwhere you know who did it and cant prove it.",
    "So you know who did it Anthony regarded him with interest.",
    "Well Im pretty certain\nin my own mind.",
    "Lady Alexandra Farraday.",
    "So thats your bet said Race.",
    "Reasons\nYou shall have em.",
    "Id say shes the type thats madly jealous.",
    "And autocratic too.",
    "Like\nthat queen in history  Eleanor of Something that followed the clue to Fair Rosamunds\nBower and offered her the choice of a dagger or a cup of poison.",
    "Only in this case said Anthony she didnt offer Fair Rosemary any choice.",
    "Chief Inspector Kemp went on Someone tips Mr Barton off.",
    "He becomes suspicious  and\nI should say his suspicions were pretty definite.",
    "He wouldnt have gone so far as actually\nbuying a house in the country unless he wanted to keep an eye on the Farradays.",
    "He must\nhave made it pretty plain to her  harping on this party and urging them to come to it.",
    "Shes\nnot the kind to Wait and See.",
    "Autocratic again she finished him off That you say so far is\nall theory and shorthand report made when I took her statement.",
    "If I had the poor fellow\nwould have been in hospital with writers cramp.",
    "Well said Anthony.",
    "I daresay youre right Chief Inspector in saying that the case will\nnever come to trial  but thats a very unsatisfactory finish  and theres one thing we still\ndont know  who wrote those letters to George Barton telling him his wife was murdered\nWe havent the least idea who that person is.",
    "Race said Your suspicions still the same Browne\nRuth Lessing Yes I stick to her as my candidate.",
    "You told me that she admitted to you\nshe was in love with George.",
    "Rosemary by all accounts was pretty poisonous to her.",
    "Say she\nsaw suddenly a chance of getting rid of Rosemary and was fairly convinced that with\nRosemary out of the way she could marry George out of hand.",
    "I grant you all that said Race.",
    "Ill admit that Ruth Lessing has the calm practical\nefficiency that can contemplate and carry out murder and she perhaps lacks that quality\nof pity which is essentially a product of imagination.",
    "Yes I give you the first murder.",
    "But I\nsimply cant see her committing the second one.",
    "I simply cannot see her panicking and\npoisoning the man she loved and wanted to marry Another point that rules her out  why\ndid she hold her tongue when she saw Iris throw the cyanide packet under the table\nPerhaps she didnt see her do it suggested Anthony rather doubtfully.",
    "Im fairly sure she did said Race.",
    "When I was questioning her I had the impression\nthat she was keeping something back.",
    "And Iris Marle herself thought Ruth Lessing saw\nher.",
    "Come now colonel said Kemp.",
    "Lets have your spot.",
    "Youve got one I suppose\nRace nodded.",
    "Out with it.",
    "Fairs fair.",
    "Youve listened to ours  and raised objections.",
    "Races eyes went thoughtfully from Kemps face to Anthony and rested there.",
    "Anthonys eyebrows rose.",
    "Dont say you still think I am the villain of the piece\nSlowly Race shook his head.",
    "I can imagine no possible reason why you should kill George Barton.",
    "I think I know who\ndid kill him  and Rosemary Barton too.",
    "Who is it\nRace said musingly Curious how we have all selected women as suspects.",
    "I suspect a\nwoman too.",
    "He paused and said quietly I think the guilty person is Iris Marle.",
    "With a crash Anthony pushed his chair back.",
    "For a moment his face went dark crimson then with an effort he regained command of himself.",
    "His voice when he spoke had a very\nslight tremor but was deliberately as light and mocking as ever.",
    "By all means let us discuss the possibility he said.",
    "Why Iris Marle And if so why\nshould she of her own accord tell me about dropping the cyanide paper under the table\nBecause said Race she knew that Ruth Lessing had seen her do it.",
    "Anthony considered the reply his head on one side.",
    "Finally he nodded.",
    "Passed he said.",
    "Go on.",
    "Why did you suspect her in the first place\nMotive said Race.",
    "An enormous fortune had been left to Rosemary in which Iris was\nnot to participate.",
    "For all we know she may have struggled for years with a sense of\nunfairness.",
    "She was aware that if Rosemary died childless all that money came to her.",
    "And\nRosemary was depressed unhappy run down after flu just the mood when a verdict of\nsuicide would be accepted without question.",
    "Thats right make the girl out a monster said Anthony.",
    "Not a monster said Race.",
    "There is another reason why I suspected her  a farfetched\none it may seem to you  Victor Drake.",
    "Victor Drake Anthony stared.",
    "Bad blood.",
    "You see I didnt listen to Lucilla Drake for nothing.",
    "I know all about the\nMarle family.",
    "Victor Drake  not so much weak as positively evil.",
    "His mother feeble in\nintellect and incapable of concentration.",
    "Hector Marle weak vicious and a drunkard.",
    "Rosemary emotionally unstable.",
    "A family history of weakness vice and instability.",
    "Predisposing causes.",
    "Anthony lit a cigarette.",
    "His hands trembled.",
    "Dont you believe that there may be a sound blossom on a weak or even a bad stock\nOf course there may.",
    "But I am not sure that Iris Marle is a sound blossom.",
    "And my word doesnt count Anthony said slowly because Im in love with her.",
    "George\nshowed her those letters and she got in a funk and killed him Thats how it goes on is it\nYes.",
    "Panic would obtain in her case.",
    "And how did she get the stuff into Georges champagne glass\nThat I confess I do not know.",
    "Im thankful theres something you dont know.",
    "Anthony tilted his chair back and then\n\n\fforward.",
    "His eyes were angry and dangerous.",
    "Youve got a nerve saying all this to me.",
    "Race replied quietly I know.",
    "But I considered it had to be said.",
    "Kemp watched them both with interest but he did not speak.",
    "He stirred his tea round and\nround absentmindedly.",
    "Very well.",
    "Anthony sat upright.",
    "Things have changed.",
    "Its no longer a question of\nsitting round a table drinking disgusting fluids and airing academic theories.",
    "This case\nhas got to be solved.",
    "Weve got to resolve all the difficulties and get at the truth.",
    "Thats got\nto be my job  and Ill do it somehow.",
    "Ive got to hammer at the things we dont know because when we do know them the whole thing will be clear.",
    "Ill restate the problem.",
    "Who knew that Rosemary had been murdered Who wrote to\nGeorge telling him so Why did they write to him\nAnd now the murders themselves.",
    "Wash out the first one.",
    "Its too long ago and we dont\nknow exactly what happened.",
    "But the second murder took place in front of my eyes.",
    "I saw\nit happen.",
    "Therefore I ought to know how it happened.",
    "The ideal time to put the cyanide in\nGeorges glass was during the cabaret  but it couldnt have been put in then because he\ndrank from his glass immediately afterwards.",
    "I saw him drink.",
    "After he drank nobody put\nanything in his glass.",
    "Nobody touched his glass nevertheless next time he drank it was full\nof cyanide.",
    "He couldnt have been poisoned  but he was There was cyanide in his glass but nobody could have put it there Are we getting on\nNo said Chief Inspector Kemp.",
    "Yes said Anthony.",
    "The thing has now entered into the realm of a conjuring trick.",
    "Or a\nspirit manifestation.",
    "I will now outline my psychic theory.",
    "Whilst we were dancing the\nghost of Rosemary hovers near Georges glass and drops in some cleverly materialised\ncyanide  any spirit can make cyanide out of ectoplasm.",
    "George comes back and drinks her\nhealth and  oh Lord.",
    "The other two stared curiously at him.",
    "His hands were holding his head.",
    "He rocked to and\nfro in apparent mental agony.",
    "He said\nThats it... thats it... the bag... the waiter...",
    "The waiter Kemp was alert.",
    "Anthony shook his head.",
    "No no.",
    "I dont mean what you mean.",
    "I did think once that what we needed was a waiter\nwho was not a waiter but a conjurer  a waiter who had been engaged the day before.",
    "Instead we had a waiter who had always been a waiter  and a little waiter who was of the\nroyal line of waiters  a cherubic waiter  a waiter above suspicion.",
    "And hes still above\nsuspicion  but he played his part Oh Lord yes he played a star part.",
    "He stared at them.",
    "Dont you see it A waiter could have poisoned the champagne but the waiter didnt.",
    "Nobody touched Georges glass but George was poisoned.",
    "A indefinite article.",
    "The definite\narticle.",
    "Georges glass George Two separate things.",
    "And the money  lots and lots of\nmoney And who knows  perhaps love as well Dont look at me as though Im mad.",
    "Come\non Ill show you.",
    "Thrusting his chair back he sprang to his feet and caught Kemp by the arm.",
    "Come with me.",
    "Kemp cast a regretful glance at his halffull cup.",
    "Got to pay he muttered.",
    "No no well be back in a moment.",
    "Come on.",
    "I must show you outside.",
    "Come on Race.",
    "Pushing the table aside he swept them away with him to the vestibule.",
    "You see that telephone box there\nYes\nAnthony felt in his pockets.",
    "Damn I havent got twopence.",
    "Never mind.",
    "On second thoughts Id rather not do it that\nway.",
    "Come back.",
    "They went back into the caf\u00e9 Kemp first Race following with Anthonys hand on his arm.",
    "Kemp had a frown on his face as he sat down and picked up his pipe.",
    "He blew down it\ncarefully and began to operate on it with a hairpin which he brought out of his waistcoat\npocket.",
    "Race was frowning at Anthony with a puzzled face.",
    "He leaned back and picked up his cup\ndraining the remaining fluid in it.",
    "Damn he said violently.",
    "Its got sugar in it\nHe looked across the table to meet Anthonys slowly widening smile.",
    "Hallo said Kemp as he took a sip from his cup.",
    "What the hells this\nCoffee said Anthony.",
    "And I dont think youll like it.",
    "I didnt.",
    "Chapter 13\nAnthony had the pleasure of seeing instant comprehension flash into the eyes of both his\ncompanions.",
    "His satisfaction was shortlived for another thought struck him with the force of a physical\nblow.",
    "He ejaculated out loud My God  that car.",
    "He sprang up.",
    "Fool that I was  idiot She told me that a car had nearly run her down  and I hardly\nlistened.",
    "Come on quick\nKemp said She said she was going straight home when she left the Yard.",
    "Yes.",
    "Why didnt I go with her\nWhos at the house asked Race.",
    "Ruth Lessing was there waiting for Mrs Drake.",
    "Its possible that theyre both discussing\nthe funeral still\nDiscussing everything else as well if I know Mrs Drake said Race.",
    "He added abruptly\nHas Iris Marle any other relations\nNot that I know of.",
    "I think I see the direction in which your thoughts ideas are leading you.",
    "But  is it\nphysically possible\nI think so.",
    "Consider for yourself how much has been taken for granted on one persons\nword.",
    "Kemp was paying the check.",
    "The three men hurried out as Kemp said\nYou think the danger is acute To Miss Marle\nYes I do.",
    "Anthony swore under his breath and hailed a taxi.",
    "The three men got in and the driver was\ntold to go to Elvaston Square as quickly as possible.",
    "Kemp said slowly Ive only got the general idea as yet.",
    "It washes the Farradays right\nout.",
    "Yes.",
    "Thank goodness for that.",
    "But surely there wouldnt be another attempt  so soon\nThe sooner the better said Race.",
    "Before theres any chance of our minds running on\nthe right track.",
    "Third time lucky  that will be the idea.",
    "He added Iris Marle told me in\nfront of Mrs Drake that she would marry you as soon as you wanted her to.",
    "They spoke in spasmodic jerks for the taxidriver was taking their directions literally and\nwas hurtling round corners and cutting through traffic with immense enthusiasm.",
    "Turning\nwith a final spurt into Elvaston Square he drew up with a terrific jerk in front of the\nhouse.",
    "Elvaston Square had never looked more peaceful.",
    "Anthony with an effort regaining his usual cool manner murmured Quite like the\nmovies.",
    "Makes one feel rather a fool somehow.",
    "But he was on the top step ringing the bell while Race paid off the taxi and Kemp followed\nup the steps.",
    "The parlourmaid opened the door.",
    "Anthony said sharply Has Miss Iris got back\nEvans looked a little surprised.",
    "Oh yes sir.",
    "She came in half an hour ago.",
    "Anthony breathed a sigh of relief.",
    "Everything in the house was so calm and normal that he\nfelt ashamed of his recent melodramatic fears.",
    "Where is she\nI expect shes in the drawingroom with Mrs Drake.",
    "Anthony nodded and took the stairs in easy strides.",
    "Race and Kemp close beside him.",
    "In\nthe drawingroom placid under its shaded electric lights Lucilla Drake was hunting\nthrough the pigeon holes of the desk with the hopeful absorption of a terrier and\nmurmuring audibly\nDear dear now where did I put Mrs Marshams letter Now let me see...\nWhere is Iris demanded Anthony abruptly.",
    "Lucilla turned and stared.",
    "Iris She  I beg your pardon She drew herself up.",
    "May I ask who you are\nRace came forward from behind him and Lucillas face cleared.",
    "She did not yet see Chief\nInspector Kemp who was the third to enter the room.",
    "Oh dear Colonel Race How kind of you to come But I do wish you could have been\nhere a little earlier  I should have liked to consult you about the funeral arrangements  a\nmans advice so valuable  and really I was feeling so upset as I said to Miss Lessing that\nreally I couldnt even think  and I must say that Miss Lessing was really very sympathetic\nfor once and offered to do everything she could to take the burden off my shoulders  only\nas she put it very reasonably naturally I should be the person most likely to know what\nwere Georges favourite hymns  not that I actually did because Im afraid George didnt\nvery often go to church  but naturally as a clergymans wife  I mean widow  I do know\nwhat is suitable \nRace took advantage of a momentary pause to slip in his question Where is Miss Marle\nIris She came in some time ago.",
    "She said she had a headache and was going straight up\nto her room.",
    "Young girls you know do not seem to me to have very much stamina\nnowadays  they dont eat enough spinach  and she seems positively to dislike talking about\nthe funeral arrangements but after all someone has to do these things  and one does want\n\n\fto feel that everything has been done for the best and proper respect shown to the dead not that I have ever thought motor hearses really reverent  if you know what I mean  not\nlike horses with their long black tails  but of course I said at once that it was quite all\nright and Ruth  I called her Ruth and not Miss Lessing  and I were managing splendidly\nand she could leave everything to us.",
    "Kemp asked Miss Lessing has gone\nYes we settled everything and Miss Lessing left about ten minutes ago.",
    "She took the\nannouncements for the papers with her.",
    "No flowers under the circumstances  and Canon\nWestbury to take the service \nAs the flow went on Anthony edged gently out of the door.",
    "He had left the room before\nLucilla suddenly interrupting her narrative paused to say Who was that young man\nwho came with you I didnt realise at first that you had brought him.",
    "I thought possibly he\nmight have been one of those dreadful reporters.",
    "We have had such trouble with them.",
    "Anthony was running lightly up the stairs.",
    "Hearing footsteps behind him he turned his\nhead and grinned at Chief Inspector Kemp.",
    "You deserted too Poor old Race\nKemp muttered.",
    "He does these things so nicely.",
    "Im not popular in that quarter.",
    "They were on the second floor and just preparing to start up the third when Anthony\nheard a light footstep descending.",
    "He pulled Kemp inside an adjacent bathroom door.",
    "The footsteps went on down the stairs.",
    "Anthony emerged and ran up the next flight of stairs.",
    "Iriss room he knew was the small\none at the back.",
    "He rapped lightly on the door.",
    "Hi  Iris.",
    "There was no reply  and he knocked and called again.",
    "Then he tried the handle\nbut found the door locked.",
    "With real urgency now he beat upon it.",
    "Iris  Iris \nAfter a second or two he stopped and glanced down.",
    "He was standing on one of those\nwoolly oldfashioned rugs made to fit outside doors to obviate draughts.",
    "This one was close\nup against the door and Anthony kicked it away.",
    "The space under the door at the bottom\nwas quite wide  sometime he deduced it had been cut to clear a fitted carpet instead of\nstained boards.",
    "He stooped to the keyhole but could see nothing but suddenly he raised his head and\nsniffed.",
    "Then he lay down flat and pressed his nose against the crack under the door.",
    "Springing up he shouted Kemp\nThere was no sign of the Chief Inspector.",
    "Anthony shouted again.",
    "It was Colonel Race however who came running up the stairs.",
    "Anthony gave him no\nchance to speak.",
    "He said\nGas  pouring out Well have to break the door down.",
    "Race had a powerful physique.",
    "Both he and Anthony made short shrift of the obstacle.",
    "With a splintering cracking noise the lock gave.",
    "They fell back for a moment then Race said Shes there by the fireplace.",
    "Ill dash in and\nbreak the window.",
    "You get her.",
    "Iris Marle was lying by the gas fire  her mouth and nose lying on the wide open gas jet.",
    "A minute or two later choking and spluttering Anthony and Race laid the unconscious girl\non the landing floor in the draught of the passage window.",
    "Race said Ill work on her.",
    "You get a doctor quickly.",
    "Anthony swung down the stairs.",
    "Race called after him\nDont worry.",
    "I think shell be all right.",
    "We got here in time.",
    "In the hall Anthony dialled and spoke into the mouthpiece hampered by a background of\nexclamations from Lucilla Drake.",
    "He turned at last from the telephone to say with a sigh of relief Caught him.",
    "He lives just\nacross the Square.",
    "Hell be here in a couple of minutes.",
    "but I must know what has happened Is Iris ill\nIt was a final wail from Lucilla.",
    "Anthony said She was in her room.",
    "Door locked.",
    "Her head in the gas fire and the gas full\non.",
    "Iris Mrs Drake gave a piercing shriek.",
    "Iris has committed suicide I cant believe it.",
    "I\ndont believe it\nA faint ghost of Anthonys grin returned to him.",
    "You dont need to believe it he said.",
    "It isnt true.",
    "Chapter 14\nAnd now please Tony will you tell me all about it\nIris was lying on a sofa and the valiant November sunshine was making a brave show\noutside the windows of Little Priors.",
    "Anthony looked across at Colonel Race who was sitting on the windowsill and grinned\nengagingly\nI dont mind admitting Iris that Ive been waiting for this moment.",
    "If I dont explain to\nsomeone soon how clever Ive been I shall burst.",
    "There will be no modesty in this recital.",
    "It\nwill be a shameless blowing of my own trumpet with suitable pauses to enable you to say\nAnthony how clever of you or Tony how wonderful or some phrase of a like nature.",
    "Ahem The performance will now begin.",
    "Here we go.",
    "The thing as a whole looked simple enough.",
    "What I mean is that it looked like a clear case\nof cause and effect.",
    "Rosemarys death accepted at the time as suicide was not suicide.",
    "George became suspicious started investigating was presumably getting near the truth\nand before he could unmask the murderer he was in his turn murdered.",
    "The sequence if I\nmay put it that way seems perfectly clear.",
    "But almost at once we came across some apparent contradictions.",
    "Such as A. George\ncould not be poisoned.",
    "B. George was poisoned.",
    "And A.",
    "Nobody touched Georges glass.",
    "B.\nGeorges glass was tampered with.",
    "Actually I was overlooking a very significant fact  the varied use of the possessive case.",
    "Georges ear is Georges ear indisputably because it is attached to his head and cannot be\nremoved without a surgical operation But by Georges watch I mean the watch that\nGeorge is wearing  the question might arise whether it is his or maybe one lent him by\nsomeone else.",
    "And when I come to Georges glass or Georges teacup I begin to realise that\nI mean something very vague indeed.",
    "All I actually mean is the glass or cup out of which\nGeorge has lately been drinking  and which has nothing to distinguish it from several\nother cups and glasses of the same pattern.",
    "To illustrate this I tried an experiment.",
    "Race was drinking tea without sugar Kemp was\ndrinking tea with sugar and I was drinking coffee.",
    "In appearance the three fluids were of\n\n\fmuch the same colour.",
    "We were sitting round a small marbletopped table among several\nother round marbletopped tables.",
    "On the pretext of an urgent brainwave I urged the other\ntwo out of their seats and out into the vestibule pushing the chairs aside as we went and\nalso managing to move Kemps pipe which was lying by his plate to a similar position by\nmy plate but without letting him see me do it.",
    "As soon as we were outside I made an excuse\nand we returned Kemp slightly ahead.",
    "He pulled the chair to the table and sat down\nopposite the plate that was marked by the pipe he had left behind him.",
    "Race sat on his right\nas before and I on his left  but mark what happened  a new A. and B. contradiction A.\nKemps cup has sugared tea in it.",
    "B. Kemps cup has coffee in it.",
    "Two conflicting statements\nthat cannot both be true  But they are both true.",
    "The misleading term is Kemps cup.",
    "Kemps cup when he left the table and Kemps cup when he returned to the table are not\nthe same.",
    "And that Iris is what happened at the Luxembourg that night.",
    "After the cabaret when\nyou all went to dance you dropped your bag.",
    "A waiter picked it up  a waiter not the\nwaiter attending on that table who knew just where you had been sitting  but a waiter an\nanxious hurried little waiter with everybody bullying him running along with a sauce and\nwho quickly stooped picked up the bag and placed it by a plate  actually by the plate one\nplace to the left of where you had been sitting.",
    "You and George came back first and you\nwent without a thought straight to the place marked by your bag  just as Kemp did to the\nplace marked by his pipe.",
    "George sat down in what he thought to be his place on your\nright.",
    "And when he proposed his toast in memory of Rosemary he drank from what he\nthought was his glass but was in reality your glass  the glass that can quite easily have been\npoisoned without needing a conjuring trick to explain it because the only person who did\nnot drink after the cabaret was necessarily the person whose health was being drunk\nNow go over the whole business again and the setup is entirely different You were the\nintended victim not George So it looks doesnt it as though George is being used  what\nif things had not gone wrong would have been the story as the world would see it A\nrepetition of the party a year ago  and a repetition of  suicide Clearly people would say a\nsuicidal streak in that family Bit of paper which has contained cyanide found in your bag.",
    "Clear case Poor girl has been brooding over her sisters death.",
    "Very sad  but these rich\ngirls are sometimes very neurotic\nIris interrupted him.",
    "She cried out But why should anyone want to kill me Why\nWhy\nAll that lovely money angel.",
    "Money money money Rosemarys money went to you on\nher death.",
    "Now suppose you were to die  unmarried.",
    "What would happen to that money\nThe answer was it would go to your next of kin  to your aunt Lucilla Drake.",
    "Now from all\naccounts of the dear lady I could hardly see Lucilla Drake as First Murderess.",
    "But is there\nanyone else who would benefit Yes indeed.",
    "Victor Drake.",
    "If Lucilla has money it will be\nexactly the same as Victor having it  Victor will see to that He has always been able to do\nwhat he likes with his mother.",
    "And there is nothing difficult about seeing Victor as First\nMurderer.",
    "All along from the very start of the case there had been reference to Victor\nmentions of Victor.",
    "He has been in the offing a shadowy unsubstantial evil figure.",
    "But Victors in the Argentine Hes been in South America for over a year.",
    "Has he Were coming now to what has been said to be the fundamental plot of every\nstory.",
    "Girl meets Boy When Victor met Ruth Lessing this particular story started.",
    "He\ngot hold of her.",
    "I think she must have fallen for him pretty badly.",
    "Those quiet\n\n\flevelheaded lawabiding women are the kind that often fall for a real bad lot.",
    "Think a minute and youll realise that all the evidence for Victors being in South America\ndepends on Ruths word.",
    "None of it was verified because it was never a main issue Ruth\nsaid that she had seen Victor off on the S.S. Cristobal before Rosemarys death It was\nRuth who suggested putting a call through to Buenos Aires on the day of Georges death and later sacked the telephone girl who might have inadvertantly let out that she did no\nsuch thing.",
    "Of course its been easy to check up now Victor Drake arrived in Buenos Aires by a boat\nleaving England the day after Rosemarys death a year ago.",
    "Ogilvie in Buenos Aires had\nno telephone conversation with Ruth on the subject of Victor Drake on the day of Georges\ndeath.",
    "And Victor Drake left Buenos Aires for New York some weeks ago.",
    "Easy enough for\nhim to arrange for a cable to be sent off in his name on a certain day  one of those\nwellknown cables asking for money that seemed proof positive that he was many\nthousands of miles away.",
    "Instead of which \nYes Anthony\nInstead of which said Anthony leading up to his climax with intense pleasure he was\nsitting at the next table to ours at the Luxembourg with a not so dumb blonde\nNot that awful looking man\nA yellow blotchy complexion and bloodshot eyes are easy things to assume and they make\na lot of difference to a man.",
    "Actually of our party I was the only person apart from Ruth\nLessing who had ever seen Victor Drake  and I had never known him under that name\nIn any case I was sitting with my back to him.",
    "I did think I recognised in the cocktail\nlounge outside as we came in a man I had known in my prison days  Monkey Coleman.",
    "But as I was now leading a highly respectable life I was not too anxious that he should\nrecognise me.",
    "I never for one moment suspected that Monkey Coleman had had anything\nto do with the crime  much less that he and Victor Drake were one and the same.",
    "But I dont see now how he did it\nColonel Race took up the tale.",
    "In the easiest way in the world.",
    "During the cabaret he went out to telephone passing our\ntable.",
    "Drake had been an actor and he had been something more important  a waiter.",
    "To\nassume the makeup and play the part of Pedro Morales was childs play to an actor but to\nmove deftly round a table with the step and gait of a waiter filling up the champagne\nglasses needed the definite knowledge and technique of a man who had actually been a\nwaiter.",
    "A clumsy action or movement would have drawn your attention to him but as a\nbona fide waiter none of you noticed or saw him.",
    "You were looking at the cabaret not\nnoticing that portion of the restaurants furnishings  the waiter\nIris said in a hesitating voice And Ruth\nAnthony said It was Ruth of course who put the cyanide paper in your bag  probably in\nthe cloakroom at the beginning of the evening.",
    "The same technique she had adopted a year\nago  with Rosemary.",
    "I always thought it odd said Iris that George hadnt told Ruth about those letters.",
    "He\nconsulted her about everything.",
    "Anthony gave a short laugh.",
    "Of course he told her  first thing.",
    "She knew he would.",
    "Thats why she wrote them.",
    "Then\nshe arranged all of his plan for him  having first got him well worked up.",
    "And so she had\nthe stage set  all nicely arranged for suicide No.",
    "2  and if George chose to believe that you\n\n\fhad killed Rosemary and were committing suicide out of remorse or panic  well that\nwouldnt make any difference to Ruth\nAnd to think I liked her  liked her very much And actually wanted her to marry\nGeorge.",
    "Shed probably have made him a very good wife if she hadnt come across Victor said\nAnthony.",
    "Moral every murderess was a nice girl once.",
    "Iris shivered.",
    "All that for money\nYou innocent money is what these things are done for Victor certainly did it for money.",
    "Ruth partly for money partly for Victor and partly I think because she hated Rosemary.",
    "Yes shed travelled a long way by the time she deliberately tried to run you down in a car\nand still further when she left Lucilla in the drawingroom banged the front door and then\nran up to your bedroom.",
    "What did she seem like Excited at all\nIris considered.",
    "I dont think so.",
    "She just tapped on the door came in and said everything was fixed up\nand she hoped I was feeling all right.",
    "I said yes I was just a bit tired.",
    "And then she picked\nup my big rubbercovered torch and said what a nice torch that was and after that I dont\nseem to remember anything.",
    "No dear said Anthony.",
    "Because she hit you a nice little crack not too hard on the\nback of the neck with your nice torch.",
    "Then she arranged you artistically by the gas fire\nshut the windows tight turned on the gas went out locking the door and passing the key\nunderneath it pushed the woolly mat close up against the crack so as to shut out any\ndraught and tripped gently down the stairs.",
    "Kemp and I just got into the bathroom in time.",
    "I raced on up to you and Kemp followed Miss Ruth Lessing unbeknownst to where she had\nleft that car parked  you know I felt at the time there was something fishy and\nuncharacteristic about the way Ruth tried to force it on our minds that she had come by\nbus and tube\nIris gave a shudder.",
    "Its horrible  to think anyone was as determined to kill me as all that.",
    "Did she hate me too\nby then\nOh I shouldnt think so.",
    "But Miss Ruth Lessing is a very efficient young woman.",
    "Shed\nalready been an accessory in two murders and she didnt fancy having risked her neck for\nnothing.",
    "Ive no doubt Lucilla Drake bleated out your decision to marry me at a moments\nnotice and in that case there was no time to lose.",
    "Once married I should be your next of\nkin and not Lucilla.",
    "Poor Lucilla.",
    "Im so terribly sorry for her.",
    "I think we all are.",
    "Shes a harmless kindly soul.",
    "Is he really arrested\nAnthony looked at Race who nodded and said\nThis morning when he landed in New York.",
    "Was he going to marry Ruth  afterwards\nThat was Ruths idea.",
    "I think she would have brought it off too.",
