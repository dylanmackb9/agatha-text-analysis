    "Agatha Christie \u0099 MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS\n\n\n\nPART I\nTHE FACTS\n1\n\nAN IMPORTANT PASSENGER ON THE TAURUS EXPRESS\n\nIt was five o\u2019clock on a winter\u2019s morning in Syria.",
    "Alongside the platform at Aleppo stood the\ntrain grandly designated in railway guides as the Taurus Express.",
    "It consisted of a kitchen and\ndiningcar a sleepingcar and two local coaches.",
    "By the step leading up into the sleepingcar stood a young French lieutenant resplendent in\nuniform conversing with a small man muffled up to the ears of whom nothing was visible but a\npinktipped nose and the two points of an upwardcurled moustache.",
    "It was freezingly cold and this job of seeing off a distinguished stranger was not one to be\nenvied but Lieutenant Dubosc performed his part manfully.",
    "Graceful phrases fell from his lips in\npolished French.",
    "Not that he knew what it was all about.",
    "There had been rumours of course as\nthere always were in such cases.",
    "The General\u2019s\u2014his General\u2019s\u2014temper had grown worse and\nworse.",
    "And then there had come this Belgian stranger\u2014all the way from England it seemed.",
    "There had been a week\u2014a week of curious tensity.",
    "And then certain things had happened.",
    "A\nvery distinguished officer had committed suicide another had suddenly resigned anxious faces\nhad suddenly lost their anxiety certain military precautions were relaxed.",
    "And the General\nLieutenant Dubosc\u2019s own particular General had suddenly looked ten years younger.",
    "Dubosc had overheard part of a conversation between him and the stranger.",
    "\u201cYou have saved\nus mon cher\u201d said the General emotionally his great white moustache trembling as he spoke.",
    "\u201cYou have saved the honour of the French Army\u2014you have averted much bloodshed How can I\nthank you for acceding to my request To have come so far\u2014\u201d\nTo which the stranger by name M. Hercule Poirot had made a fitting reply including the\nphrase\u2014\u201cBut indeed do I not remember that once you saved my life\u201d And then the General\nhad made another fitting reply to that disclaiming any merit for that past service and with more\nmention of France of Belgium of glory of honour and of such kindred things they had\nembraced each other heartily and the conversation had ended.",
    "As to what it had all been about Lieutenant Dubosc was still in the dark but to him had been\ndelegated the duty of seeing off M. Poirot by the Taurus Express and he was carrying it out with\nall the zeal and ardour befitting a young officer with a promising career ahead of him.",
    "\u201cToday is Sunday\u201d said Lieutenant Dubosc.",
    "\u201cTomorrow Monday evening you will be in\nStamboul.\u201d\nIt was not the first time he had made this observation.",
    "Conversations on the platform before\nthe departure of a train are apt to be somewhat repetitive in character.",
    "\u201cThat is so\u201d agreed M. Poirot.",
    "7\n\n\fAgatha Christie \u0099 MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS\n\n\u201cAnd you intend to remain there a few days I think\u201d\n\u201cMais oui.",
    "Stamboul it is a city I have never visited.",
    "It would be a pity to pass through\u2014\ncomme \u00e7a.\u201d He snapped his fingers descriptively.",
    "\u201cNothing presses\u2014I shall remain there as a\ntourist for a few days.\u201d\n\u201cLa Sainte Sophie it is very fine\u201d said Lieutenant Dubosc who had never seen it.",
    "A cold wind came whistling down the platform.",
    "Both men shivered.",
    "Lieutenant Dubosc\nmanaged to cast a surreptitious glance at his watch.",
    "Five minutes to five\u2014only five minutes\nmore\nFancying that the other man had noticed his glance he hastened once more into speech.",
    "\u201cThere are few people travelling this time of year\u201d he said glancing up at the windows of the\nsleepingcar above them.",
    "\u201cThat is so\u201d agreed M. Poirot.",
    "\u201cLet us hope you will not be snowed up in the Taurus\u201d\n\u201cThat happens\u201d\n\u201cIt has occurred yes.",
    "Not this year as yet.\u201d\n\u201cLet us hope then\u201d said M. Poirot.",
    "\u201cThe weather reports from Europe they are bad.",
    "\u201cVery bad.",
    "In the Balkans there is much snow.\u201d\n\u201cIn Germany too I have heard.\u201d\n\u201cEh bien\u201d said Lieutenant Dubosc hastily as another pause seemed to be about to occur.",
    "\u201cTomorrow evening at sevenforty you will be in Constantinople.\u201d\n\u201cYes\u201d said M. Poirot and went on desperately \u201cLa Sainte Sophie I have heard it is very\nfine.\u201d\n\u201cMagnificent I believe.\u201d\nAbove their heads the blinds of one of the sleepingcar compartments was pushed aside and a\nyoung woman looked out.",
    "Mary Debenham had had little sleep since she left Baghdad on the preceding Thursday.",
    "Neither in the train to Kirkuk nor in the Rest House at Mosul nor last night on the train had she\nslept properly.",
    "Now weary of lying wakeful in the hot stuffiness of her overheated compartment\nshe got up and peered out.",
    "This must be Aleppo.",
    "Nothing to see of course.",
    "Just a long poorly lighted platform with\nloud furious altercations in Arabic going on somewhere.",
    "Two men below her window were\ntalking French.",
    "One was a French officer the other was a little man with enormous moustaches.",
    "She smiled faintly.",
    "She had never seen anyone quite so heavily muffled up.",
    "It must be very cold\noutside.",
    "That was why they heated the train so terribly.",
    "She tried to force the window down\nlower but it would not go.",
    "The Wagon Lit conductor had come up to the two men.",
    "The train was about to depart he said.",
    "Monsieur had better mount.",
    "The little man removed his hat.",
    "What an eggshaped head he had In\nspite of her preoccupations Mary Debenham smiled.",
    "A ridiculouslooking little man.",
    "The sort of\nlittle man one could never take seriously.",
    "Lieutenant Dubosc was saying his parting speech.",
    "He had thought it out beforehand and had\nkept it till the last minute.",
    "It was a very beautiful polished speech.",
    "Not to be outdone M. Poirot replied in kind.",
    "...\n\u201cEn voiture Monsieur\u201d said the Wagon Lit conductor.",
    "With an air of infinite reluctance M.\nPoirot climbed aboard the train.",
    "The conductor climbed after him.",
    "M. Poirot waved his hand.",
    "Lieutenant Dubosc came to the salute.",
    "The train with a terrific jerk moved slowly forward.",
    "\u201cEnfin\u201d murmured M. Hercule Poirot.",
    "8\n\n\fAgatha Christie \u0099 MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS\n\n\u201cBrrrrrrrr\u201d said Lieutenant Dubosc realising to the full how cold he was.",
    "\u201cVoil\u00e0 Monsieur\u201d The conductor displayed to Poirot with a dramatic gesture the beauty of\nhis sleeping compartment and the neat arrangement of his luggage.",
    "\u201cThe little valise of\nMonsieur I have put it here.\u201d\nHis outstretched hand was suggestive.",
    "Hercule Poirot placed in it a folded note.",
    "\u201cMerci Monsieur.\u201d The conductor became brisk and businesslike.",
    "\u201cI have the tickets of\nMonsieur.",
    "I will also take the passport please.",
    "Monsieur breaks his journey in Stamboul I\nunderstand\u201d\nM. Poirot assented.",
    "\u201cThere are not many people travelling I imagine\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cNo Monsieur.",
    "I have only two other passengers\u2014both English.",
    "A Colonel from India and a\nyoung English lady from Baghdad.",
    "Monsieur requires anything\u201d\nMonsieur demanded a small bottle of Perrier.",
    "Five o\u2019clock in the morning is an awkward time to board a train.",
    "There were still two hours\nbefore dawn.",
    "Conscious of an inadequate night\u2019s sleep and of a delicate mission successfully\naccomplished M. Poirot curled up in a corner and fell asleep.",
    "When he awoke it was halfpast nine he sallied forth to the restaurant car in search of hot\ncoffee.",
    "There was only one occupant at the moment obviously the young English lady referred to by\nthe conductor.",
    "She was tall slim and dark\u2014perhaps twentyeight years of age.",
    "There was a kind\nof cool efficiency in the way she was eating her breakfast and in the way she called to the\nattendant to bring her more coffee which bespoke a knowledge of the world and of travelling.",
    "She wore a darkcoloured travelling dress of some thin material eminently suitable for the heated\natmosphere of the train.",
    "M. Hercule Poirot having nothing better to do amused himself by studying her without\nappearing to do so.",
    "She was he judged the kind of young woman who could take care of herself with perfect\nease wherever she went.",
    "She had poise and efficiency.",
    "He rather liked the severe regularity of her\nfeatures and the delicate pallor of her skin.",
    "He liked the burnished black head with its neat waves\nof hair and her eyes\u2014cool impersonal and grey.",
    "But she was he decided just a little too\nefficient to be what he called \u201cjolie femme.\u201d\nPresently another person entered the restaurant car.",
    "This was a tall man of between forty and\nfifty lean of figure brown of skin with hair slightly grizzled round the temples.",
    "\u201cThe Colonel from India\u201d said Poirot to himself.",
    "The newcomer gave a little bow to the girl.",
    "\u201cMorning Miss Debenham.\u201d\n\u201cGood morning Colonel Arbuthnot.\u201d\nThe Colonel was standing with a hand on the chair opposite her.",
    "\u201cAny objections\u201d he asked.",
    "\u201cOf course not.",
    "Sit down.\u201d\n\u201cWell you know breakfast isn\u2019t always a chatty meal.\u201d\n\u201cI should hope not.",
    "But I don\u2019t bite.\u201d\nThe Colonel sat down.",
    "\u201cBoy\u201d he called in peremptory fashion.",
    "He gave an order for eggs and coffee.",
    "His eyes rested for a moment on Hercule Poirot but they passed on indifferently.",
    "Poirot\nreading the English mind correctly knew that he had said to himself.",
    "\u201cOnly some damned\nforeigner.\u201d\n\n9\n\n\fAgatha Christie \u0099 MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS\n\nTrue to their nationality the two English people were not chatty.",
    "They exchanged a few brief\nremarks and presently the girl rose and went back to her compartment.",
    "At lunch time the other two again shared a table and again they both completely ignored the\nthird passenger.",
    "Their conversation was more animated than at breakfast.",
    "Colonel Arbuthnot\ntalked of the Punjab and occasionally asked the girl a few questions about Baghdad where it\nbecame clear she had been in a post as governess.",
    "In the course of conversation they discovered\nsome mutual friends which had the immediate effect of making them more friendly and less\nstiff.",
    "They discussed old Tommy Somebody and old Reggie Someone Else.",
    "The Colonel\ninquired whether she was going straight through to England or whether she was stopping in\nStamboul.",
    "\u201cNo I\u2019m going straight on.\u201d\n\u201cIsn\u2019t that rather a pity\u201d\n\u201cI came out this way two years ago and spent three days in Stamboul then.\u201d\n\u201cOh I see.",
    "Well I may say I\u2019m very glad you are going right through because I am.\u201d\nHe made a kind of clumsy little bow flushing a little as he did so.",
    "\u201cHe is susceptible our Colonel\u201d thought Hercule Poirot to himself with some amusement.",
    "\u201cThe train it is as dangerous as a sea voyage\u201d\nMiss Debenham said evenly that that would be very nice.",
    "Her manner was slightly repressive.",
    "The Colonel Hercule Poirot noticed accompanied her back to her compartment.",
    "Later they\npassed through the magnificent scenery of the Taurus.",
    "As they looked down towards the Cilician\nGates standing in the corridor side by side a sigh came suddenly from the girl.",
    "Poirot was\nstanding near them and heard her murmur\n\u201cIt\u2019s so beautiful I wish\u2014I wish\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYes\u201d\n\u201cI wish I could enjoy it\u201d\nArbuthnot did not answer.",
    "The square line of his jaw seemed a little sterner and grimmer.",
    "\u201cI wish to Heaven you were out of all this\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cHush please.",
    "Hush.\u201d\n\u201cOh it\u2019s all right.\u201d He shot a slightly annoyed glance in Poirot\u2019s direction.",
    "Then he went on\n\u201cBut I don\u2019t like the idea of your being a governess\u2014at the beck and call of tyrannical mothers\nand their tiresome brats.\u201d\nShe laughed with just a hint of uncontrol in the sound.",
    "\u201cOh you mustn\u2019t think that.",
    "The downtrodden governess is quite an exploded myth.",
    "I can\nassure you that it\u2019s the parents who are afraid of being bullied by me.\u201d\nThey said no more.",
    "Arbuthnot was perhaps ashamed of his outburst.",
    "\u201cRather an odd little comedy that I watch here\u201d said Poirot to himself thoughtfully.",
    "He was to remember that thought of his later.",
    "They arrived at Konya that night about halfpast eleven.",
    "The two English travellers got out to\nstretch their legs pacing up and down the snowy platform.",
    "M. Poirot was content to watch the teeming activity of the station through a window pane.",
    "After about ten minutes however he decided that a breath of air would not perhaps be a bad\nthing after all.",
    "He made careful preparations wrapping himself in several coats and mufflers and\nencasing his neat boots in goloshes.",
    "Thus attired he descended gingerly to the platform and\nbegan to pace its length.",
    "He walked out beyond the engine.",
    "It was the voices which gave him the clue to the two indistinct figures standing in the shadow\nof a traffic van.",
    "Arbuthnot was speaking.",
    "10\n\n\fAgatha Christie \u0099 MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS\n\n\u201cMary\u2014\u201d\nThe girl interrupted him.",
    "\u201cNot now.",
    "Not now.",
    "When it\u2019s all over.",
    "When it\u2019s behind us\u2014then\u2014\u201d\nDiscreetly M. Poirot turned away.",
    "He wondered.",
    "...",
    "He would hardly have recognised the cool efficient voice of Miss Debenham.",
    "...\n\u201cCurious\u201d he said to himself.",
    "The next day he wondered whether perhaps they had quarrelled.",
    "They spoke little to each\nother.",
    "The girl he thought looked anxious.",
    "There were dark circles under her eyes.",
    "It was about halfpast two in the afternoon when the train came to a halt.",
    "Heads were poked\nout of windows.",
    "A little knot of men were clustered by the side of the line looking and pointing\nat something under the diningcar.",
    "Poirot leaned out and spoke to the Wagon Lit conductor who was hurrying past.",
    "The man\nanswered and Poirot drew back his head and turning almost collided with Mary Debenham\nwho was standing just behind him.",
    "\u201cWhat is the matter\u201d she asked rather breathlessly in French.",
    "\u201cWhy are we stopping\u201d\n\u201cIt is nothing Mademoiselle.",
    "It is something that has caught fire under the diningcar.",
    "Nothing serious.",
    "It is put out.",
    "They are now repairing the damage.",
    "There is no danger I assure\nyou.\u201d\nShe made a little abrupt gesture as though she were waving the idea of danger aside as\nsomething completely unimportant.",
    "\u201cYes yes I understand that.",
    "But the time\u201d\n\u201cThe time\u201d\n\u201cYes this will delay us.\u201d\n\u201cIt is possible\u2014yes\u201d agreed Poirot.",
    "\u201cBut we can\u2019t afford delay This train is due in at 6.55 and one has to cross the Bosphorus\nand catch the Simplon Orient Express on the other side at nine o\u2019clock.",
    "If there is an hour or two\nof delay we shall miss the connection.\u201d\n\u201cIt is possible yes\u201d he admitted.",
    "He looked at her curiously.",
    "The hand that held the window bar was not quite steady her lips\ntoo were trembling.",
    "\u201cDoes it matter to you very much Mademoiselle\u201d he asked.",
    "\u201cYes.",
    "Yes it does.",
    "I\u2014I must catch that train.\u201d\nShe turned away from him and went down the corridor to join Colonel Arbuthnot.",
    "Her anxiety however was needless.",
    "Ten minutes later the train started again.",
    "It arrived at\nHaydapassar only five minutes late having made up time on the journey.",
    "The Bosphorus was rough and M. Poirot did not enjoy the crossing.",
    "He was separated from\nhis travelling companions on the boat and did not see them again.",
    "On arrival at the Galata Bridge he drove straight to the Tokatlian Hotel.",
    "11\n\n\fAgatha Christie \u0099 MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS\n\n2\n\nTHE TOKATLIAN HOTEL\nAt the Tokatlian Hercule Poirot asked for a room with bath.",
    "Then he stepped over to the\nconcierge\u2019s desk and inquired for letters.",
    "There were three waiting for him and a telegram.",
    "His eyebrows rose a little at the sight of the\ntelegram.",
    "It was unexpected.",
    "He opened it in his usual neat unhurried fashion.",
    "The printed words stood out clearly.",
    "Development you predicted in Kassner case has come unexpectedly.",
    "Please return\nimmediately.",
    "\u201cVoil\u00e0 ce qui est emb\u00eatant\u201d muttered Poirot vexedly.",
    "He glanced up at the clock.",
    "\u201cI shall\nhave to go on tonight\u201d he said to the concierge.",
    "\u201cAt what time does the Simplon Orient leave\u201d\n\u201cAt nine o\u2019clock Monsieur.\u201d\n\u201cCan you get me a sleeper\u201d\n\u201cAssuredly Monsieur.",
    "There is no difficulty this time of year.",
    "The trains are almost empty.",
    "Firstclass or second\u201d\n\u201cFirst.\u201d\n\u201cTr\u00e8s bien Monsieur.",
    "How far are you going\u201d\n\u201cTo London.\u201d\n\u201cBien Monsieur.",
    "I will get you a ticket to London and reserve your sleepingcar\naccommodation in the StamboulCalais coach.\u201d\nPoirot glanced at the clock again.",
    "It was ten minutes to eight.",
    "\u201cI have time to dine\u201d\n\u201cBut assuredly Monsieur.\u201d\nThe little Belgian nodded.",
    "He went over and cancelled his room order and crossed the hall to\nthe restaurant.",
    "As he was giving his order to the waiter a hand was placed on his shoulder.",
    "\u201cAh mon vieux but this is an unexpected pleasure\u201d said a voice behind him.",
    "The speaker was a short stout elderly man his hair cut en brosse.",
    "He was smiling delightedly.",
    "Poiret sprang up.",
    "\u201cM.",
    "Bouc\u201d\n\u201cM.",
    "Poirot\u201d\nM. Bouc was a Belgian a director of the Compagnie Internationale des Wagons Lits and his\nacquaintance with the former star of the Belgian police force dated back many years.",
    "\u201cYou find yourself far from home mon cher\u201d said M. Bouc.",
    "\u201cA little affair in Syria.\u201d\n\u201cAh and you return home\u2014when\u201d\n\u201cTonight.\u201d\n\u201cSplendid I too.",
    "That is to say I go as far as Lausanne where I have affairs.",
    "You travel on\nthe Simplon Orient I presume\u201d\n\u201cYes.",
    "I have just asked them to get me a sleeper.",
    "It was my intention to remain here some\ndays but I have.",
    "received a telegram recalling me to England on important business.\u201d\n\n12\n\n\fAgatha Christie \u0099 MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS\n\n\u201cAh\u201d sighed M. Bouc.",
    "\u201cLes affaires\u2014les affaires But you you are at the top of the tree\nnowadays mon vieux\u201d\n\u201cSome little success I have had perhaps.\u201d Hercule Poirot tried to look modest but failed\nsignally.",
    "M. Bouc laughed.",
    "\u201cWe will meet later\u201d he said.",
    "Hercule Poirot addressed himself to the task of keeping his moustaches out of the soup.",
    "That difficult task accomplished he glanced round him whilst waiting for the next course.",
    "There were only about half a dozen people in the restaurant and of those half dozen there were\nonly two that interested Hercule Poirot.",
    "These two sat at a table not far away.",
    "The younger was a likeablelooking young man of\nthirty clearly an American.",
    "It was however not he but his companion who had attracted the\nlittle detective\u2019s attention.",
    "He was a man perhaps of between sixty and seventy.",
    "From a little distance he had the bland\naspect of a philanthropist.",
    "His slightly bald head his domed forehead the smiling mouth that\ndisplayed a very white set of false teeth\u2014all seemed to speak of a benevolent personality.",
    "Only\nthe eyes belied this assumption.",
    "They were small deepset and crafty.",
    "Not only that.",
    "As the man\nmaking some remark to his young companion glanced across the room his gaze stopped on\nPoirot for a moment and just for that second there was a strange malevolence an unnatural\ntensity in the glance.",
    "Then he rose.",
    "\u201cPay the bill Hector\u201d he said.",
    "His voice was slightly husky in tone.",
    "It had a queer soft dangerous quality.",
    "When Poirot rejoined his friend in the lounge the other two men were just leaving the hotel.",
    "Their luggage was being brought down.",
    "The younger was supervising the process.",
    "Presently he\nopened the glass door and said\n\u201cQuite ready now Mr. Ratchett.\u201d\nThe elder man grunted an assent and passed out.",
    "\u201cEh bien\u201d said Poirot.",
    "\u201cWhat do you think of those two\u201d\n\u201cThey are Americans\u201d said M. Bouc.",
    "\u201cAssuredly they are Americans.",
    "I meant what did you think of their personalities\u201d\n\u201cThe young man seemed quite agreeable.\u201d\n\u201cAnd the other\u201d\n\u201cTo tell you the truth my friend I did not care for him.",
    "He produced on me an unpleasant\nimpression.",
    "And you\u201d\nHercule Poirot was a moment in replying.",
    "\u201cWhen he passed me in the restaurant\u201d he said at last \u201cI had a curious impression.",
    "It was as\nthough a wild animal\u2014an animal savage but savage you understand\u2014had passed me by.\u201d\n\u201cAnd yet he looked altogether of the most respectable.\u201d\n\u201cPr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment The body\u2014the cage\u2014is everything of the most respectable\u2014but through the\nbars the wild animal looks out.\u201d\n\u201cYou are fanciful mon vieux\u201d said M. Bouc.",
    "\u201cIt may be so.",
    "But I could not rid myself of the impression that evil had passed me by very\nclose.\u201d\n\u201cThat respectable American gentleman\u201d\n\u201cThat respectable American gentleman.\u201d\n\n13\n\n\fAgatha Christie \u0099 MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS\n\n\u201cWell\u201d said M. Bouc cheerfully \u201cit may be so.",
    "There is much evil in the world.\u201d\nAt that moment the door opened and the concierge came towards them.",
    "He looked concerned\nand apologetic.",
    "\u201cIt is extraordinary Monsieur\u201d he said to Poirot.",
    "\u201cThere is not one firstclass sleeping berth\nto be had on the train.\u201d\n\u201cComment\u201d cried M. Bouc.",
    "\u201cAt this time of year Ah without doubt there is some party of\njournalists\u2014of politicians\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know sir\u201d said the concierge turning to him respectfully.",
    "\u201cBut that\u2019s how it is.\u201d\n\u201cWell well.\u201d M. Bouc turned to Poirot.",
    "\u201cHave no fear my friend.",
    "We will arrange something.",
    "There is always one compartment the No.",
    "16 which is not engaged.",

    "But\nsomehow\u2014\u201d he gave a slight shiver\u2014\u201cI felt that there was a good deal going on underneath the\nquietness.\u201d\nPoirot nodded.",

    "\u201cMr.",

    "It is true Mr. Ratchett did not\ntell him that he had tried to enlist my services and failed but I do not think that that is really a\nsuspicious circumstance.",
    "I fancy Mr. Ratchett was a gentleman who kept his own counsel on\nevery possible occasion.\u201d\n\u201cSo you pronounce one person at least innocent of the crime\u201d said M. Bouc jovially.",

    "I was careful not to move the body in making my examination.\u201d\nPoirot nodded.",
    "He looked round him.",
    "The first thing that struck the senses was the intense cold.",
    "The window was pushed down as\nfar as it would go and the blind was drawn up.",

    "\u201cYou are right\u201d he announced.",
    "\u201cNobody left the carriage this way.",
    "Possibly the open window\nwas intended to suggest that somebody did but if so the snow has defeated the murderer\u2019s\nintention.\u201d\nHe examined the frame of the window carefully.",
    "Taking a small case from his pocket he blew\na little powder over the frame.",
    "\u201cNo fingerprints at all\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cThat means it has been wiped.",
    "Well if there had been\nfingerprints they would have told us very little.",
    "They would have been those of Mr. Ratchett or\nhis valet or the conductor.",
    "Criminals do not make mistakes of that kind nowadays.",
    "\u201cAnd that being so\u201d he added cheerfully \u201cwe might as well shut the window.",
    "Positively it is\nthe cold storage in here\u201d\nHe suited the action to the word and then turned his attention for the first time to the\nmotionless figure lying in the bunk.",
    "Ratchett lay on his back.",
    "His pyjama jacket stained with rusty patches had been unbuttoned\nand thrown back.",
    "\u201cI had to see the nature of the wounds you see\u201d explained the doctor.",

    "\u201cIt is not pretty\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cSomeone must have stood there and stabbed him again and again.",
    "How many wounds are there exactly\u201d\n\u201cI make it twelve.",
    "One or two are so slight as to be practically scratches.",
    "On the other hand at\nleast three would be capable of causing death.\u201d\nSomething in the doctor\u2019s tone caught Poirot\u2019s attention.",
    "He looked at him sharply.",
    "The little\nGreek was standing staring down at the body with a puzzled frown.",
    "\u201cSomething strikes you as odd does it not\u201d he asked gently.",

    "Each cut must\nhave severed blood vessels\u2014and yet the edges do not gape.",
    "They have not bled as one would\nhave expected.\u201d\n\u201cWhich suggests\u201d\n\u201cThat the man was already dead\u2014some little time dead\u2014when they were delivered.",
    "But that\nis surely absurd.\u201d\n\u201cIt would seem so\u201d said Poirot thoughtfully.",

    "Some of these other blows are just as obviously righthanded.\u201d\n\u201cTwo people.",
    "We are back at two people again\u201d murmured the detective.",

    "You see it is turned off by the conductor every morning about ten\no\u2019clock.\u201d\n\u201cThe switches will tell us\u201d said Poirot.",
    "He examined the switch of the top light and also the rollback bedhead light.",
    "The former was\nturned off.",
    "The latter was closed.",
    "\u201cEh bien\u201d he said thoughtfully.",

    "\u201cSee you my dear doctor me I am not one to rely upon the expert procedure.",
    "It is the\npsychology I seek not the fingerprint or the cigarette ash.",

    "Then there is another.",
    "Did a woman kill him and did she deliberately drop a pipecleaner to\nmake it look like a man\u2019s work Or are we seriously to suppose that two people a man and a\nwoman were separately concerned and that each was so careless as to drop a clue to his or her\nidentity It is a little too much of a coincidence that\u201d\n\u201cBut where does the hatbox come in\u201d asked the doctor still puzzled.",

    "Possibly a note.",
    "If\nso there was something in that note some mistake some error that left a possible clue to the\nassailant.",
    "I am going to try to discover what that something was.\u201d\nHe went out of the compartment and returned a few moments later with a small spirit stove\nand a pair of curlingtongs.",

    "The doctor watched him with great interest.",

    "He clapped the other on\ntop of it and then holding both pieces together with the tongs held the whole thing over the\nflame of the spiritlamp.",
    "\u201cIt is a very makeshift affair this\u201d he said over his shoulder.",
    "\u201cLet us hope that it will answer\nour purpose.\u201d\nThe doctor watched the proceedings attentively.",
    "The metal began to glow.",

    "Let us first make sure that we have seen all there is to be\nseen here.\u201d\nQuickly and deftly he went once more through the pockets of the dead man\u2019s clothes but\nfound nothing there of interest.",

    "Where were you at a quarter past\none\u2019\n\u201cI Monsieur I was at my little seat at the end\u2014facing up the corridor.\u201d\n\u201cYou are sure\u201d\n\u201cMais oui\u2014at least\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI went into the next coach the Athens coach to speak to my colleague there.",
    "We spoke\nabout the snow.",
    "That was at some time soon after one o\u2019clock.",
    "I cannot say exactly.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you returned\u2014when\u201d\n\u201cOne of my bells rang Monsieur\u2014I remember\u2014I told you.",
    "It was the American lady.",
    "She\nhad rung several times.\u201d\n\u201cI recollect\u201d said Poirot.",
    "\u201cAnd after that\u201d\n\u201cAfter that Monsieur I answered your bell and brought you some mineral water.",
    "Then about\nhalf an hour later I made up the bed in one of the other compartments\u2014that of the young\nAmerican gentleman Mr. Ratchett\u2019s secretary.\u201d\n\u201cWas Mr. MacQueen alone in his compartment when you went to make up his bed\u201d\n\u201cThe English Colonel from No.",

    "I had made it up while he was at dinner.\u201d\n\u201cWhat time was all this\u201d\n\u201cI could not say exactly Monsieur.",
    "Not later than two o\u2019clock certainly.\u201d\n\u201cAnd after that\u201d\n\u201cAfter that Monsieur I sat in my seat till morning.\u201d\n\u201cYou did not go again into the Athens coach\u201d\n\u201cNo Monsieur.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps you slept\u201d\n\u201cI do not think so Monsieur.",
    "The train being at a standstill prevented me from dozing off as I\nusually do.\u201d\n\u201cDid you see any of the passengers moving up or down the corridor\u201d\nThe man reflected.",
    "\u201cOne of the ladies went to the toilet at the far end I think.\u201d\n\u201cWhich lady\u201d\n\n43\n\n\fAgatha Christie \u0099 MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS\n\n\u201cI do not know Monsieur.",

    "\u201cI wondered whether you would remember that.",
    "By the way I\nwas awakened by what sounded like something heavy falling against my door.",
    "Have you any\nidea what that could have been\u201d\nThe man stared at him.",
    "\u201cThere was nothing Monsieur.",
    "Nothing I am positive of it.\u201d\n\u201cThen I must have had the cauchemar\u201d said Poirot philosophically.",
    "\u201cUnless\u201d put in M. Bouc \u201cit was something in the compartment next door that you heard.\u201d\nPoirot took no notice of the suggestion.",
    "Perhaps he did not wish to before the Wagon Lit\nconductor.",
    "\u201cLet us pass to another point\u201d he said.",

    "After the service of dinner the door between the ordinary carriages and the\nsleepingcars is locked.\u201d\n\u201cDid you yourself descend from the train at Vincovci\u201d\n\u201cYes Monsieur.",
    "I got down onto the platform as usual and stood by the step up into the train.",
    "The other conductors did the same.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about the forward door\u2014the one near the restaurant car\u201d\n\u201cIt is always fastened on the inside.\u201d\n\u201cIt is not so fastened now.\u201d\nThe man looked surprised then his face cleared.",
    "\u201cDoubtless one of the passengers opened it\nto look out on the snow.\u201d\n\u201cProbably\u201d said Poirot.",
    "He tapped thoughtfully on the table for a minute or two.",
    "\u201cMonsieur does not blame me\u201d said the man timidly.",
    "Poirot smiled on him kindly.",
    "\u201cYou have had the evil chance my friend\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cAh one other point while I remember it.",
    "You said that another bell rang just as you were knocking at M. Ratchett\u2019s door.",
    "In fact I heard it\nmyself Whose was it\u201d\n\u201cIt was the bell of Madame la Princesse Dragomiroff.",
    "She desired me to summon her maid.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you did so\u201d\n\u201cYes Monsieur.\u201d\nPoirot studied the plan in front of him thoughtfully.",

    "He looked at M. Bouc.",
    "\u201cDo not distress yourself\u201d said the latter kindly \u201cI cannot see that there has been any\nnegligence on your part.\u201d\nGratified Pierre Michel left the compartment.",

    "\u201cWell\u201d he said \u201chow are things going\u201d\n\u201cNot too badly.",
    "Since our last conversation I have learnt something\u2014the identity of Mr.\nRatchett.\u201d\nHector MacQueen leaned forward interestedly.",
    "\u201cYes\u201d he said.",
    "\u201c \u2018Ratchett\u2019 as you suspected was merely an alias.",
    "The man \u2018Ratchett\u2019 was Cassetti who ran\nthe celebrated kidnapping stunts\u2014including the famous affair of little Daisy Armstrong.\u201d\nAn expression of utter astonishment appeared on MacQueen\u2019s face.",
    "Then it darkened.",
    "\u201cThe\ndamned skunk\u201d he exclaimed.",
    "\u201cYou had no idea of this Mr. MacQueen\u201d\n\u201cNo sir\u201d said the young American decidedly.",
    "\u201cIf I had I\u2019d have cut off my right hand before\nit had a chance to do secretarial work for him\u201d\n\u201cYou feel strongly about the matter Mr. MacQueen\u201d\n\u201cI have a particular reason for doing so.",
    "My father was the district attorney who handled the\ncase Mr. Poirot.",
    "I saw Mrs. Armstrong more than once\u2014she was a lovely woman.",

    "I\u2019m rejoiced at his end.",
    "Such a man wasn\u2019t fit to live\u201d\n\u201cYou almost feel as though you would have been willing to do the good deed yourself\u201d\n\u201cI do.",
    "I\u2014\u201d He paused then added rather guiltily \u201cSeems I\u2019m kind of incriminating myself.\u201d\n\u201cI should be more inclined to suspect you Mr. MacQueen if you displayed an inordinate\nsorrow at your employer\u2019s decease.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I could do that even to save myself from the chair\u201d said MacQueen grimly.",
    "Then he added \u201cIf I\u2019m not being unduly curious just how did you figure this out Cassetti\u2019s\nidentity I mean.\u201d\n\u201cBy a fragment of a letter found in his compartment.\u201d\n\u201cBut surely\u2014I mean\u2014that was rather careless of the old man\u201d\n\u201cThat depends\u201d said Poirot \u201con the point of view.\u201d\nThe young man seemed to find this remark rather baffling.",
    "He stared at Poirot as though\ntrying to make him out.",
    "\u201cThe task before me\u201d said Poirot \u201cis to make sure of the movements of every one on the\ntrain.",
    "No offence need be taken you understand.",

    "Get right on with it and let me clear my character if I can.\u201d\n\u201cI need hardly ask you the number of your compartment\u201d said Poirot smiling \u201csince I shared\nit with you for a night.",
    "It is the secondclass compartment Nos.",
    "6 and 7 and after my departure\nyou had it to yourself.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\n\n46\n\n\fAgatha Christie \u0099 MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS\n\n\u201cNow Mr. MacQueen I want you to describe your movements last night from the time of\nleaving the diningcar.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s quite easy.",
    "I went back to my compartment read a bit got out on the platform at\nBelgrade decided it was too cold and got in again.",
    "I talked for a while to a young English lady\nwho is in the compartment next to mine.",
    "Then I fell into conversation with that Englishman\nColonel Arbuthnot\u2014as a matter of fact I think you passed us as we were talking.",
    "Then I went in\nto Mr. Ratchett and as I told you took down some memoranda of letters he wanted written.",
    "I\nsaid good tight to him and left him.",
    "Colonel Arbuthnot was still standing in the corridor.",
    "His\ncompartment was already made up for the night so I suggested that he should come along to\nmine.",
    "I ordered a couple of drinks and we got right down to it.",
    "Discussed world politics and the\nGovernment of India and our own troubles with Prohibition and the Wall Street crisis.",
    "I don\u2019t as\na rule cotton to Britishers\u2014they\u2019re a stiffnecked lot\u2014but I liked this one.\u201d\n\u201cDo you know what time it was when he left you\u201d\n\u201cPretty late.",
    "Nearly two o\u2019clock I should say.\u201d\n\u201cYou noticed that the train had stopped\u201d\n\u2018Oh yes.",
    "We wondered a bit.",
    "Looked out and saw the snow lying very thick but we didn\u2019t\nthink it was serious.\u201d\n\u201cWhat happened when Colonel Arbuthnot finally said good night\u201d\n\u201cHe went along to his compartment and I called to the conductor to make up my bed.\u201d\n\u201cWhere were you whilst he was making it\u201d\n\u201cStanding just outside the door in the corridor smoking a cigarette.\u201d\n\u201cAnd then\u201d\n\u201cAnd then I went to bed and slept till morning.\u201d\n\u201cDuring the evening did you leave the train at all\u201d\n\u201cArbuthnot and I thought we\u2019d get out at\u2014what was the name of the place\u2014Vincovci\u2014to\nstretch our legs a bit.",
    "But it was bitterly cold\u2014a blizzard on.",
    "We soon hopped back again.\u201d\n\u201cBy which door did you leave the train\u201d\n\u201cBy the one nearest to our compartment.\u201d\n\u201cThe one next to the diningcar\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cDo you remember if it was bolted\u201d\nMacQueen considered.",
    "\u201cWhy yes I seem to remember it was.",
    "At least there was a kind of bar that fitted across the\nhandle.",
    "Is that what you mean\u201d\n\u201cYes.",
    "On getting back into the train did you replace that bar\u201d\n\u201cWhy no\u2014I don\u2019t think I did.",
    "I got in last.",
    "No I don\u2019t seem to remember doing so.\u201d He\nadded suddenly \u201cIs that an important point\u201d\n\u201cIt may be.",
    "Now I presume Monsieur that while you and Colonel Arbuthnot were sitting\ntalking the door of your compartment into the corridor was open\u201d\nHector MacQueen nodded.",
    "\u201cI want you if you can to tell me if anyone passed along that corridor after the train left\nVincovci up to the time you parted company for the night.\u201d\nMacQueen drew his brows together.",
    "\u201cI think the conductor passed along once\u201d he said \u201ccoming from the direction of the diningcar.",
    "And a woman passed the other way going towards it.\u201d\n\u201cWhich woman\u201d\n\n47\n\n\fAgatha Christie \u0099 MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t say.",
    "I didn\u2019t really notice.",
    "You see I was arguing a point with Arbuthnot.",
    "I just\nseem to remember a glimpse of some scarlet silk affair passing the door.",
    "I didn\u2019t look and\nanyway I wouldn\u2019t have seen the person\u2019s face.",
    "As you know my carriage faces the diningcar\nend of the train so a woman going along the corridor in that direction would have her back to me\nas soon as she\u2019d passed.\u201d\nPoirot nodded.",
    "\u201cShe was going to the toilet I presume\u201d\n\u201cI suppose so.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you saw her return\u201d\n\u201cWell no now that you mention it I didn\u2019t notice her returning but I suppose she must have\ndone so.\u201d\n\u201cOne more question.",
    "Do you smoke a pipe Mr. MacQueen\u201d\n\u201cNo sir I do not.\u201d\nPoirot paused a moment.",
    "\u201cI think that is all at present.",
    "I should now like to see the valet of Mr.\nRatchett.",
    "By the way did both you and he always travel secondclass\u201d\n\u201cHe did.",
    "But I usually went first\u2014if possible in the compartment adjoining Mr. Ratchett\u2019s.",
    "Then he had most of his baggage put in my compartment and yet could get at both it and me\neasily whenever he chose.",
    "But on this occasion all the firstclass berths were booked except the\none that he took.\u201d\n\u201cI comprehend.",

    "\u201cWell sir I think he was upset.\u201d\n\u201cIn what way\u2014upset\u201d\n\u201cOver a letter he\u2019d been reading.",
    "He asked me if it was I who had put it in his compartment.",
    "Of course I told him I hadn\u2019t done any such thing but he swore at me and found fault with\neverything I did.\u201d\n\u201cWas that unusual\u201d\n\u201cOh no sir.",
    "He lost his temper easily\u2014as I say it just depended what had happened to upset\nhim.\u201d\n\u201cDid your master ever take a sleeping draught\u201d\nDr. Constantine leaned forward a little.",

    "And would you believe it there wasn\u2019t a soul there\u201d\nThis seemed to Mrs. Hubbard to be a dramatic climax rather than an anticlimax.",

    "I made him look under the seat though he said there\nwasn\u2019t room for a man to squeeze himself in there.",
    "It was plain enough that the man had got\naway\u2014but there had been a man there and it just made me mad the way the conductor tried to\nsoothe me down I\u2019m not one to imagine things Mr.\u2014I don\u2019t think I know your name\u201d\n\u201cPoirot Madame and this is M.

    "Who else could he be\u201d\n\u201cAnd you think he went back into the adjoining compartment\u201d\n\u201cHow do I know where he went I had my eyes tight shut.\u201d\n\u201cHe might have slipped out through the door into the corridor.\u201d\n\u201cWell I couldn\u2019t say.",

    "He turned gently to the lady.",
    "\u201cThis button Madame may have dropped from the conductor\u2019s uniform either when he\nsearched your cabin or when he was making the bed up last night.\u201d\n\u201cI just don\u2019t know what\u2019s the matter with all you people.",
    "Seems as though you don\u2019t want to\ndo anything but make objections.",
    "Now listen here.",
    "I was reading a magazine last night before I\nwent to sleep.",
    "Before I turned the light out I placed that magazine on a little case that was\nstanding on the floor near the window.",

    "\u201cVery well then.",
    "The conductor looked under the seat from near the door and then he came in\nand bolted the door between me and the next compartment but he never went near the window.",
    "Well this morning that button was lying right on top of the magazine.",
    "What do you call that I\nshould like to know\u201d\n\u201cThat Madame I call evidence\u201d said Poirot.",

    "\u201cOh you had\u201d\n\u201cWell as a matter of fact I asked that Swedish creature\u2014a pleasant soul\u2014if it was bolted\nand she said it was.\u201d\n\u201cHow was it you couldn\u2019t see for yourself\u201d\n\u201cBecause I was in bed and my spongebag was hanging on the doorhandle.\u201d\n\u201cWhat time was it when you asked her to do this for you\u201d\n\u201cNow let me think.",
    "It must have been round about halfpast ten or a quarter to eleven.",
    "She\u2019d\ncome along to see if I had an aspirin.",
    "I told her where to find it and she got it out of my grip.\u201d\n\u201cYou yourself were in bed\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\nSuddenly she laughed.",

    "\u201cBut yes I do.",
    "Ratchett was the man.\u201d\n\u201cWell Well to think of that I must write and tell my daughter.",

    "They are very\nreserved the English.",
    "So I appeal to you Monsieur in the interest of justice.",
    "What sort of person\nis this Miss Debenham What do you know about her\u201d\n\u201cMiss Debenham\u201d said the Colonel with some warmth \u201cis a lady.\u201d\n\u201cAh\u201d said Poirot with every appearance of being much gratified.",
    "\u201cSo you do not think that\nshe is likely to be implicated in this crime\u201d\n\n68\n\n\fAgatha Christie \u0099 MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS\n\n\u201cThe idea is absurd\u201d said Arbuthnot.",

    "He\u2019d got hold of some tomfool idiotic ideas about the\nsituation in India.",
    "That\u2019s the worst of Americans\u2014they\u2019re so sentimental and idealistic.",
    "Well he\nwas interested in what I had to tell him.",
    "I\u2019ve had nearly thirty years\u2019 experience of the country.",
    "And I was interested in what he had to tell me about the working of Prohibition in America.",
    "Then we got down to world politics in general.",
    "I was quite surprised to look at my watch and\nfind it was a quarter to two.\u201d\n\u201cThat is the time you broke up this conversation\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cWhat did you do then\u201d\n\u201cWalked along to my own compartment and turned in.\u201d\n\u201cYour bed was made up ready\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cThat is the compartment\u2014let me see\u2014No.",

    "As a matter of fact MacQueen called him just as I went in\nto my own compartment.\u201d\n\u201cWhy did he call him\u201d\n\u201cTo make up his bed I suppose.",
    "The compartment hadn\u2019t been made up for the night.\u201d\n\u201cNow Colonel Arbuthnot I want you to think carefully.",
    "During the time you were talking to\nMr. MacQueen did anyone pass along the corridor outside the door\u201d\n\u201cA good many people I should think.",

    "\u201cThe English they open\neverything\u2014then others they come along and shut everything.",
    "It is very difficult.\u201d\nNeither Poirot nor Colonel Arbuthnot paid any attention to him.",

    "You\nhave returned to the train.",
    "You sit down again you smoke\u2014perhaps a cigarette\u2014perhaps a\npipe\u2014\u201d\nHe paused for the fraction of a second.",
    "\u201cA pipe for me.",
    "MacQueen smoked cigarettes.\u201d\n\u201cThe train starts again.",
    "You smoke your pipe.",
    "You discuss the state of Europe\u2014of the world.",

    "Wasn\u2019t looking that way.",
    "just a rustle and a sort of smell of scent.\u201d\n\u201cScent A good scent\u201d\n\u201cWell rather fruity if you know what I mean.",
    "I mean you\u2019d smell it a hundred yards away.",
    "But mind you\u201d the Colonel went on hastily \u201cthis may have been earlier in the evening.",
    "You see\nas you said just now it was just one of those things you notice without noticing so to speak.",
    "Some time that evening I said to myself\u2014\u2018Woman\u2014scent\u2014got it on pretty thick.\u2019 But when it\nwas I can\u2019t be sure except that\u2014why yes it must have been after Vincovci.\u201d\n\u201cWhy\u201d\n\u201cBecause I remember\u2014sniffing you know\u2014just when I was talking about the utter washout\nStalin\u2019s Five Year Plan was turning out.",
    "I know the idea woman brought the idea of the position\nof women in Russia into my mind.",
    "And I know we hadn\u2019t got on to Russia until pretty near the\nend of our talk.\u201d\n\u201cYou can\u2019t pin it down more definitely than that\u201d\n\u201cNno.",
    "It must have been roughly within the last halfhour.\u201d\n\u201cIt was after the train had stopped\u201d\nThe other nodded.",

    "\u201cThen in my opinion the swine deserved what he got.",
    "Though I would have preferred to see him properly hanged\u2014or electrocuted I suppose over\nthere.\u201d\n\u201cIn fact Colonel Arbuthnot you prefer law and order to private vengeance\u201d\n\u201cWell you can\u2019t go about having blood feuds and stabbing each other like Corsicans or the\nMafia\u201d said the Colonel.",
    "\u201cSay what you like trial by jury is a sound system.\u201d\nPoirot looked at him thoughtfully for a minute or two.",
    "\u201cYes\u201d he said.",
    "I am sure that would be your view.",
    "Well Colonel Arbuthnot I do not think\nthere is anything more I have to ask you.",
    "There is nothing you yourself can recall last night that\nin any way snuck you\u2014or shall we say strikes you now looking back\u2014as suspicious\u201d\nArbuthnot considered for a moment or two.",
    "\u201cNo\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cNothing at all.",

    "Go on.\u201d\n\u201cOh it\u2019s nothing.",
    "A mere detail.",

    "16.\u201d\n\u201cWell the door of it was not quite closed.",
    "And the fellow inside peered out in a furtive sort of\nway.",
    "Then he pulled the door to quickly.",
    "Of course I know there\u2019s nothing in that\u2014but it just\nstruck me as a bit odd.",
    "I mean it\u2019s quite usual to open a door and stick your head out if you want\nto see anything.",
    "But it was the furtive way he did it that caught my attention.\u201d\n\u201cYees\u201d said Poirot doubtfully.",
    "\u201cI told you there was nothing to it\u201d said Arbuthnot apologetically.",
    "\u201cBut you know what it\nis\u2014early hours of the morning\u2014everything very still.",
    "The thing had a sinister look\u2014like a\ndetective story.",
    "All nonsense really.\u201d\nHe rose.",
    "\u201cWell if you don\u2019t want me any more\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThank you Colonel Arbuthnot there is nothing else.\u201d\nThe soldier hesitated for a minute.",
    "His first natural distaste for being questioned by\n\u201cforeigners\u201d had evaporated.",
    "\u201cAbout Miss Debenham\u201d he said rather awkwardly.",
    "\u201cYou can take it from me that she\u2019s all\nright.",
    "She\u2019s a pukka sahib.\u201d\nFlushing a little he withdrew.",
    "\u201cWhat\u201d asked Dr. Constantine with interest \u201cdoes a pukka sahib mean\u201d\n\u201cIt means\u201d said Poirot \u201cthat Miss Debenham\u2019s father and brothers were at the same kind of\nschool as Colonel Arbuthnot was.\u201d\n\u201cOh said Dr. Constantine disappointed.",
    "\u201cThen it has nothing to do with the crime at all.\u201d\n\u201cExactly\u201d said Poirot.",
    "He fell into a reverie beating a light tattoo on the table.",
    "Then he looked up.",

    "\u201cIn the compartment of Mr. Ratchett I found a\npipecleaner.",

    "He put up a proposition to me.",
    "I was to\ntravel by the same train as he did to Parrus and see that nobody got him.",
    "Well gentlemen I did\ntravel by the same train and in spite of me somebody did get him.",
    "I certainly feel sore about it.",
    "It doesn\u2019t look any too good for me.\u201d\n\u201cDid he give you any indication of the line you were to take\u201d\n\u201cSure.",
    "He had it all taped out.",
    "It was his idea that I should travel in the compartment alongside\nhis.",
    "Well that blew up right at the start.",
    "The only place I could get was berth No.",

    "There was only the diningcar in front of the Stamboul sleepingcar and the door onto the platform at the front end was barred at night.",
    "The only way a thug\ncould come was through the rearend door to the platform or along the train from the rear and in\neither case he\u2019d have to pass right by my compartment.\u201d\n\u201cYou had no idea I suppose of the identity of the possible assailant\u201d\n\u201cWell I knew what he looked like.",

    "\u201cIt\u2019s hard to say.",
    "Pretty nearly everyone connected with\nthat case is dead.\u201d\n\u201cThere was the girl who threw herself out of the window remember.\u201d\n\u201cSure.",
    "That\u2019s a good point that.",
    "She was a foreigner of some kind.",
    "Maybe she had some Wop\nrelations.",
    "But you\u2019ve got to remember that there were other cases besides the Armstrong one.",
    "Cassetti had been running this kidnapping stunt for some time.",
    "You can\u2019t concentrate on that\nonly.\u201d\nAh but we have reason to believe that this crime is connected with the Armstrong case.\u201d\nMr. Hardman cocked an inquiring eye.",
    "Poirot did not respond.",
    "The American shook his head.",
    "\u201cI can\u2019t call to mind anybody answering that description in the Armstrong case\u201d he said\nslowly.",
    "\u201cBut of course I wasn\u2019t in it and didn\u2019t know much about it.\u201d\n\u201cWell continue your narrative Mr. Hardman.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s very little to tell.",
    "I got my sleep in the daytime and stayed awake on the watch at\nnight.",
    "Nothing suspicious happened the first night.",
    "Last night was the same as far as I was\nconcerned.",
    "I had my door a little ajar and watched.",

    "Nobody got on that train from outside and nobody came along the train\nfrom the rear carriages.",
    "I\u2019ll take my oath on that.\u201d\n\u201cCould you see the conductor from your position\u201d\n\u201cSure.",
    "He sits on that little seat almost flush with my door.\u201d\n\u201cDid he leave that seat at all after the train stopped at Vincovci\u201d\n\u201cThat was the last station Why yes he answered a couple of bells\u2014that would be just after\nthe train came to a halt for good.",
    "Then after that he went past me into the rear coach\u2014was there\nabout a quarter of an hour.",
    "There was a bell ringing like mad and he came back running.",
    "I\nstepped out into the corridor to see what it was all about\u2014felt a mite nervous you understand\u2014\nbut it was only the American dame.",
    "She was raising hell about something or other I grinned.",
    "Then he went on to another compartment and came back and got a bottle of mineral water for\nsomeone.",
    "After that he settled down in his seat till he went up to the far end to make somebody\u2019s\nbed up.",
    "I don\u2019t think he stirred after that until about five o\u2019clock this morning.\u201d\n\u201cDid he doze off at all\u201d\n\u201cThat I can\u2019t say.",
    "He may have.\u201d\nPoirot nodded.",
    "Automatically his hands straightened the papers on the table.",

    "\u201cBe so good as just to initial this\u201d he said.",
    "The other complied.",

    "Unless it might be young MacQueen.",

    "\u201cI will pass over for the moment certain rather peculiar appearances which Dr. Constantine\nand I have already discussed together.",
    "I will come to them presently.",
    "The next fact of\nimportance to my mind is the time of the crime.\u201d\n\u201cThat again is one of the few things we do know\u201d said M. Bouc.",
    "\u201cThe crime was committed\nat a quarter past one this morning.",
    "Everything goes to show that that was so.\u201d\n\u201cNot everything.",
    "You exaggerate.",
    "There is certainly a fair amount of evidence to support that\nview.\u201d\n\u201cI am glad you admit that at least.\u201d\nPoirot went on calmly unperturbed by the interruption.",
    "\u201cWe have before us three\npossibilities.",
    "86\n\n\fAgatha Christie \u0099 MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS\n\n\u201c1\u2014that the crime was committed as you say at a quarter past one.",
    "This is supported by the\nevidence of the watch by the evidence of Mrs. Hubbard and by the evidence of the German\nwoman Hildegarde Schmidt.",
    "It agrees with the evidence of Dr. Constantine.",
    "\u201c2\u2014that the crime was committed later and that the evidence of the watch was deliberately\nfaked in order to mislead.",
    "\u201c3\u2014that the crime was committed earlier and the evidence faked for the same reason as\nabove.",
    "\u201cNow if we accept possibility 1 as the most likely to have occurred and the one supported\nby most evidence we must also accept certain facts arising from it.",
    "If the crime was committed\nat a quarter past one the murderer cannot have left the train and the questions arise Where is\nhe And who is he\n\u201cTo begin with let us examine the evidence carefully.",
    "We first hear of the existence of this\nman\u2014the small dark man with a womanish voice\u2014from the man Hardman.",
    "He says that\nRatchett told him of this person and employed him to watch out for the man.",
    "There is no\nevidence to support this we have only Hardman\u2019s word for it.",
    "Let us next examine the question\nIs Hardman the person he pretends to be an operative of a New York detective agency\n\u201cWhat to my mind is so interesting in this case is that we have none of the facilities afforded\nto the police.",
    "We cannot investigate the bona fides of any of these people.",
    "We have to rely solely\non deduction.",
    "That to me makes the matter very much more interesting.",
    "There is no routine\nwork.",
    "It is all a matter of the intellect.",
    "I ask myself Can we accept Hardman\u2019s account of\nhimself I make my decision and I answer \u2018Yes.\u2019 I am of the opinion that we can accept\nHardman\u2019s account of himself.\u201d\n\u201cYou rely on the intuition What the Americans call \u2018the hunch\u2019\u201d asked Dr. Constantine.",
    "\u201cNot at all.",
    "I regard the probabilities.",
    "Hardman is travelling with a false passport\u2014that will at\nonce make him an object of suspicion.",
    "The first thing that the police will do when they do arrive\nupon the scene is to detain Hardman and cable as to whether his account of himself is true.",
    "In the\ncase of many of the passengers to establish their bona fides will be difficult in most cases it will\nprobably not be attempted especially since there seems nothing in the way of suspicion attaching\nto them.",
    "But in Hardman\u2019s case it is simple.",
    "Either he is the person he represents himself to be\nor he is not.",
    "Therefore I say that all will prove to be in order.\u201d\n\u201cYou acquit him of suspicion\u201d\n\u201cNot at all.",
    "You misunderstand me.",
    "For all I know any American detective might have his\nown private reasons for wishing to murder Ratchett.",
    "No what I am saying is that I think we can\naccept Hardman\u2019s own account of himself.",
    "This story then that he tells of Ratchett\u2019s seeking\nhim out and employing him is not unlikely and is most probably\u2014though not of course\ncertainly\u2014true.",
    "If we are going to accept it as true we must see if there is any confirmation of it.",
    "We find it in rather an unlikely place\u2014in the evidence of Hildegarde Schmidt.",
    "Her description of\nthe man she saw in Wagon Lit uniform tallies exactly.",
    "Is there any further confirmation of these\ntwo stories There is.",
    "There is the button that Mrs. Hubbard found in her compartment.",
    "And\nthere is also another corroborating statement which you may not have noticed.\u201d\n\u201cWhat is that\u201d\n\u201cThe fact that both Colonel Arbuthnot and Hector MacQueen mention that the conductor\npassed their carriage.",
    "They attached no importance to the fact but Messieurs Pierre Michel has\ndeclared that he did not leave his seat except on certain specified occasions\u2014none of which\nwould take him down to the far end of the coach past the compartment in which Arbuthnot and\nMacQueen were sitting.",
    "87\n\n\fAgatha Christie \u0099 MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS\n\n\u201cTherefore this story the story of a small dark man with a womanish voice dressed in Wagon\nLit uniform rests on the testimony direct or indirect of four witnesses.\u201d\n\u201cOne small point\u201d said Dr. Constantine.",
    "\u201cIf Hildegarde Schmidt\u2019s story is true how is it that\nthe real conductor did not mention having seen her when he came to answer Mrs. Hubbard\u2019s\nbell\u201d\n\u201cThat is explained I think.",

    "He had two heavy leather\nsuitcases.",
    "\u201cThe rest of my kit has gone by long sea\u201d he explained.",
    "Like most Army men the Colonel was a neat packer.",
    "The examination of his baggage took\nonly a few minutes.",

    "\u201cUsually.",
    "If I can get \u2019em.\u201d\n\u201cAh\u201d Poirot nodded.",
    "These pipecleaners corresponded exactly with the one he had found on\nthe floor of the dead man\u2019s compartment.",

    "It was that occupied by Princess Dragomiroff.",
    "They knocked on the door and the Princess\u2019s deep voice called \u201cEntrez\u201d\nM. Bouc was spokesman.",
    "He was very deferential and polite as he explained their errand.",
    "The Princess listened to him in silence her small toadlike face quite impassive.",
    "\u201cIf it is necessary Messieurs\u201d she said quietly when he had finished \u201cthat is all there is to it.",
    "My maid has the keys.",
    "She will attend to it with you.\u201d\n\u201cDoes your maid always carry your keys Madame\u201d asked Poirot.",
    "\u201cCertainly Monsieur.\u201d\n\u201cAnd if during the night at one of the frontiers the customs officials should require a piece of\nluggage to be opened\u201d\nThe old lady shrugged her shoulders.",
    "\u201cIt is very unlikely.",
    "But in such a case the conductor\nwould fetch her.\u201d\n\u201cYou trust her then implicitly Madame\u201d\n\u201cI have told you so already\u201d said the Princess quietly.",
    "\u201cI do not employ people whom I do not\ntrust.\u201d\n\u201cYes\u201d said Poirot thoughtfully.",
    "\u201cTrust is indeed something in these days.",
    "It is perhaps better\nto have a homely woman whom one can trust than a more chic maid\u2014for example some smart\nParisienne.\u201d\nHe saw the dark intelligent eyes come slowly round and fasten themselves upon his face.",

    "What do you think then That I would not soil\nmy hands with killing such canaille as that man Cassetti Well perhaps you are right.\u201d\nShe was silent a minute or two.",
    "Then she said\n\u201cWith such a man as that do you know what I should have liked to do I should have liked to\ncall to my servants \u2018Flog this man to death and fling him out on the rubbish heap\u2019 That is the\nway things were done when I was young Monsieur.\u201d\nStill he did not speak just listened attentively.",

    "What is it\nthat you are thinking I wonder\u201d\nHe looked at her with a very direct glance.",
    "\u201cI think Madame that your strength is in your\nwill\u2014not in your arm.\u201d\nShe glanced down at her thin blackclad arms ending in those clawlike yellow hands with\nthe rings on the fingers.",
    "\u201cIt is true\u201d she said.",
    "\u201cI have no strength in these\u2014none.",
    "I do not know whether I am sorry or\nglad.\u201d\nThen she turned abruptly back towards her carriage where the maid was busily packing up the\ncases.",

    "\u201cThis may be awkward.",
    "These are diplomatic passports.",
    "Their luggage is\nexempt.\u201d\n\u201cFrom customs examination yes.",
    "But a murder is different.\u201d\n\u201cI know.",
    "All the same\u2014we do not want to have complications.\u201d\n\u201cDo not distress yourself my friend.",
    "The Count and Countess will be reasonable.",
    "See how\namiable Princess Dragomiroff was about it.\u201d\n\u201cShe is truly grande dame.",
    "These two are also of the same position but the Count impressed\nme as a man of somewhat truculent disposition.",
    "He was not pleased when you insisted on\nquestioning his wife.",
    "And this will annoy him still further.",
    "Suppose\u2014eh\u2014we omit them.",
    "After\nall they can have nothing to do with the matter.",
    "Why should I stir up needless trouble for\nmyself\u201d\n\u201cI do not agree with you\u201d said Poirot.",
    "\u201cI feel sure that Count Andrenyi will be reasonable.",
    "At\nany rate let us make the attempt.\u201d\nAnd before M. Bouc could reply he rapped sharply on the door of No.",
    "13.",
    "A voice from within cried \u201cEntrez\u201d\nThe Count was sitting in the corner near the door reading a newspaper.",
    "The Countess was\ncurled up in the opposite corner near the window.",
    "There was a pillow behind her head and she\nseemed to have been asleep.",
    "\u201cPardon Monsieur le Comte\u201d began Poirot.",
    "\u201cpray forgive this intrusion.",
    "It is that we are\nmaking a search of all the baggage on the train.",
    "In most cases a mere formality.",
    "But it has to be\ndone.",
    "M. Bouc suggests that as you have a diplomatic passport you might reasonably claim to\nbe exempt from such a search.\u201d\n\n96\n\n\fAgatha Christie \u0099 MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS\n\nThe Count considered for a moment.",
    "\u201cThank you\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cBut I do not think that I care to have an exception made in my case.",
    "I\nshould prefer that our baggage should be examined like that of the other passengers.\u201d\nHe turned to his wife.",
    "\u201cYou do not object I hope Elena\u201d\n\u201cNot at all\u201d said the Countess without hesitation.",
    "A rapid and somewhat perfunctory search followed.",
    "Poirot seemed to be trying to mask an\nembarrassment by making various small pointless remarks such as\n\u201cHere is a label all wet on your suitcase Madame\u201d as he lifted down a blue morocco case\nwith initials on it and a coronet.",
    "The Countess did not reply to this observation.",
    "She seemed indeed rather bored by the whole\nproceeding remaining curled up in her corner and staring dreamily out through the window\nwhilst the men searched her luggage in the compartment next door.",
    "Poirot finished his search by opening the little cupboard above the washbasin and taking a\nrapid glance at its contents\u2014a sponge face cream powder and a small bottle labelled trional.",
    "Then with polite remarks on either side the search party withdrew.",
    "Mrs. Hubbard\u2019s compartment that of the dead man and Poirot\u2019s own came next.",
    "They now came to the secondclass carriages.",
    "The first one Nos.",
    "10 and 11 was occupied by\nMary Debenham who was reading a book and Greta Ohlsson who was fast asleep but woke\nwith a start at their entrance.",
    "Poirot repeated his formula.",
    "The Swedish lady seemed agitated Mary Debenham calmly\nindifferent.",
    "He addressed himself to the Swedish lady.",
    "\u201cIf you permit Mademoiselle we will examine your baggage first and then perhaps you\nwould be so good as to see how the American lady is getting on.",
    "We have moved her into one of\nthe carriages in the next coach but she is still very much upset as the result of her discovery.",
    "I\nhave ordered coffee to be sent to her but I think she is of those to whom someone to talk to is a\nnecessity of the first order.\u201d\nThe good lady was instantly sympathetic.",
    "She would go immediately.",
    "It must have been\nindeed a terrible shock to the nerves and already the poor lady was upset by the journey and\nleaving her daughter.",
    "Ah yes certainly she would go at once\u2014her case was not locked\u2014and she\nwould take with her some sal ammoniac.",
    "She bustled off.",
    "Her possessions were soon examined.",
    "They were meagre in the extreme.",
    "She\nhad evidently not yet noticed the missing wires from the hatbox.",
    "Miss Debenham had put her book down.",
    "She was watching Poirot.",
    "When he asked her she\nhanded over her keys.",
    "Then as he lifted down a case and opened it she said\n\u201cWhy did you send her away M. Poirot\u201d\n\u201cI Mademoiselle Why to minister to the American lady.\u201d\n\u201cAn excellent pretext\u2014but a pretext all the same.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand you Mademoiselle.\u201d\n\u201cI think you understand me very well.\u201d She smiled.",
    "\u201cYou wanted to get me alone.",
    "Wasn\u2019t that\nit\u201d\n\u201cYou are putting words into my mouth Mademoiselle.\u201d\n\u201cAnd ideas into your head No I don\u2019t think so.",
    "The ideas are already there.",
    "That is right\nisn\u2019t it\u201d\n\u201cMademoiselle we have a proverb\u2014\u201d\n\u201cQui s\u2019excuse s\u2019accuse\u2014is that what you were going to say You must give me the credit for\na certain amount of observation and common sense.",
    "For some reason or other you have got it\n\n97\n\n\fAgatha Christie \u0099 MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS\n\ninto your head that I know something about this sordid business\u2014this murder of a man I never\nsaw before.\u201d\n\u201cYou are imagining things Mademoiselle.\u201d\n\u201cNo I am not imagining things at all.",
    "But it seems to me that a lot of time is wasted by not\nspeaking the truth\u2014by beating about the bush instead of coming straight out with things.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you do not like the waste of time.",
    "No you like to come straight to the point.",
    "You like\nthe direct method.",
    "Eh bien I will give it to you the direct method.",
    "I will ask you the meaning of\ncertain words that I overheard on the journey from Syria.",
    "I had got out of the train to do what the\nEnglish call \u2018stretch the legs\u2019 at the station of Konya.",
    "Your voice and the Colonel\u2019s\nMademoiselle they came to me out of the night.",
    "You said to him \u2018Not now.",
    "Not now.",
    "When it\u2019s\nall over.",
    "When it\u2019s behind us.\u2019 What did you mean by those words Mademoiselle\u201d\nShe asked very quietly \u201cDo you think I meant\u2014murder\u201d\n\u201cIt is I who am asking you Mademoiselle.\u201d\nShe sighed\u2014was lost a minute in thought.",
    "Then as though rousing herself she said\n\u201cThose words had a meaning Monsieur but not one that I can tell you.",
    "I can only give you\nmy solemn word of honour that I had never set eyes on this man Ratchett in my life until I saw\nhim on this train.\u201d\n\u201cAnd\u2014you refuse to explain those words\u201d\n\u201cYes if you like to put it that way\u2014I refuse.",
    "They had to do with\u2014with a task I had\nundertaken.\u201d\n\u201cA task that is now ended\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean\u201d\n\u201cIt is ended is it not\u201d\n\u201cWhy should you think so\u201d\n\u201cListen Mademoiselle I will recall to you another incident.",
    "There was a delay to the train on\nthe day we were to reach Stamboul.",
    "You were very agitated Mademoiselle.",
    "You so calm so\nselfcontrolled.",
    "You lost that calm.\u201d\n\u201cI did not want to miss my connection.\u201d\n\u201cSo you said.",
    "But Mademoiselle the Orient Express leaves Stamboul every day of the week.",
    "Even if you had missed the connection it would only have been a matter of twentyfour hours\u2019\ndelay.\u201d\nMiss Debenham for the first time showed signs of losing her temper.",
    "\u201cYou do not seem to realise that one may have friends awaiting one\u2019s arrival in London and\nthat a day\u2019s delay upsets arrangements and causes a lot of annoyance.\u201d\n\u201cAh it is like that There are friends awaiting your arrival You do not want to cause them\ninconvenience\u201d\n\u201cNaturally.\u201d\n\u201cAnd yet\u2014it is curious\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWhat is curious\u201d\n\u201cOn this train\u2014again we have a delay.",
    "And this time a more serious delay since there is no\npossibility of sending a telegram to your friends or of getting them on the long\u2014the long\u2014\u201d\n\u201cLong distance The telephone you mean.\u201d\n\u201cAh yes the portmanteau call as you say in England.\u201d\nMary Debenham smiled a little in spite of herself.",
    "\u201cTrunk call\u201d she corrected.",
    "\u201cYes as you\nsay it is extremely annoying not to be able to get any word through either by telephone or by\ntelegraph.\u201d\n\n98\n\n\fAgatha Christie \u0099 MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS\n\n\u201cAnd yet Mademoiselle this time your manner is quite different.",
    "You no longer betray the\nimpatience.",
    "You are calm and philosophical.\u201d\nMary Debenham flushed and bit her lip.",
    "She no longer felt inclined to smile.",
    "\u201cYou do not answer Mademoiselle\u201d\n\u201cI am sorry.",
    "I did not know that there was anything to answer.\u201d\n\u201cYour change of attitude Mademoiselle.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t you think that you are making rather a fuss about nothing M. Poirot\u201d\nPoirot spread out his hands in an apologetic gesture.",
    "\u201cIt is perhaps a fault with us detectives.",
    "We expect the behaviour to be always consistent.",
    "We\ndo not allow for changes of mood.\u201d\nMary Debenham made no reply.",
    "\u201cYou know Colonel Arbuthnot well Mademoiselle\u201d\nHe fancied that she was relieved by the change of subject.",
    "\u201cI met him for the first time on this journey.\u201d\n\u201cHave you any reason to suspect that he may have known this man Ratchett\u201d\nShe shook her head decisively.",
    "\u201cI am quite sure he didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cWhy are you sure\u201d\n\u201cBy the way he spoke.\u201d\n\u201cAnd yet Mademoiselle we found a pipecleaner on the floor of the dead man\u2019s\ncompartment.",
    "And Colonel Arbuthnot is the only man on the train who smokes a pipe.\u201d\nHe watched her narrowly but she displayed neither surprise nor emotion merely said\n\u201cNonsense.",
    "It\u2019s absurd.",
    "Colonel Arbuthnot is the last man in the world to be mixed up in a\ncrime\u2014especially a theatrical kind of crime like this.\u201d\nIt was so much what Poirot himself thought that he found himself on the point of agreeing\nwith her.",
    "He said instead\n\u201cI must remind you that you do not know him very well Mademoiselle.\u201d\nShe shrugged her shoulders.",
    "\u201cI know the type well enough.\u201d\nHe said very gently\n\u201cYou still refuse to tell me the meaning of those words \u2018When it\u2019s behind us\u2019\u201d\nShe replied coldly \u201cI have nothing more to say.\u201d\n\u201cIt does not matter\u201d said Hercule Poirot.",
    "\u201cI shall find out.\u201d\nHe bowed and left the compartment closing the door after him.",
    "\u201cWas that wise my friend\u201d asked M. Bouc.",
    "\u201cYou have put her on her guard\u2014and through\nher you have put the Colonel on his guard also.\u201d\n\u201cMon ami if you wish to catch a rabbit you put a ferret into the hole and if the rabbit is\nthere\u2014he runs.",
    "That is all I have done.\u201d\nThey entered the compartment of Hildegarde Schmidt.",
    "The woman was standing in readiness her face respectful but unemotional.",
    "Poirot took a quick glance through the contents of the small case on the seat.",
    "Then he\nmotioned to the attendant to get down the bigger suitcase from the rack.",
    "\u201cThe keys\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cIt is not locked Monsieur.\u201d\nPoirot undid the hasps and lifted the lid.",
    "\u201cAha\u201d he said and turning to M. Bouc \u201cYou remember what I said Look here a little\nmoment\u201d\nOn the top of the suitcase was a hastily rolledup brown Wagon Lit uniform.",
    "99\n\n\fAgatha Christie \u0099 MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS\n\nThe stolidity of the German woman underwent a sudden change.",
    "\u201cAch\u201d she cried.",
    "\u201cThat is not mine.",
    "I did not put it there.",
    "I have never looked in that case\nsince we left Stamboul.",
    "Indeed indeed it is true\u201d She looked from one to another of the men\npleadingly.",
    "Poirot took her gently by the arm and soothed her.",
    "\u201cNo no all is well.",
    "We believe you.",
    "Do not be agitated.",
    "I am sure you did not hide the\nuniform there as I am sure that you are a good cook.",
    "See.",
    "You are a good cook are you not\u201d\nBewildered the woman smiled in spite of herself \u201cYes indeed all my ladies have said so.",
    "I\u2014\u201d\nShe stopped her mouth open looking frightened again.",
    "\u201cNo no\u201d said Poirot.",
    "\u201cI assure you all is well.",
    "See I will tell you how this happened.",
    "This\nman the man you saw in Wagon Lit uniform comes out of the dead man\u2019s compartment.",
    "He\ncollides with you.",
    "That is bad luck for him.",
    "He has hoped that no one will see him.",
    "What to do\nnext He must get rid of his uniform.",
    "It is now not a safeguard but a danger.\u201d\nHis glance went to M. Bow and Dr. Constantine who were listening attentively.",
    "\u201cThere is the snow you see.",
    "The snow which confuses all his plans.",
    "Where can he hide these\nclothes All the compartments are full.",
    "No he passes one whose door is open showing it to be\nunoccupied.",
    "It must be the one belonging to the woman with whom he has just collided.",
    "He slips\nin removes the uniform and jams it hurriedly into a suitcase on the rack.",
    "It may be some time\nbefore it is discovered.\u201d\n\u201cAnd then\u201d said M. Bouc.",
    "\u201cThat we must discuss\u201d Poirot said with a warning glance.",
    "He held up the tunic.",
    "A button the third down was missing.",
    "Poirot slipped his hand into the\npocket and took out a conductor\u2019s passkey used to unlock the doors of the compartments.",
    "\u201cHere is the explanation of how one man was able to pass through locked doors\u201d said M.\nBouc.",
    "\u201cYour questions to Mrs. Hubbard were unnecessary.",
    "Locked or not locked the man could\neasily get through the communicating door.",
    "After all if a Wagon Lit uniform why not a Wagon\nLit key\u201d\n\u201cWhy not indeed\u201d returned Poirot.",
    "\u201cWe might have known it really.",
    "You remember that Michel said that the door into the\ncorridor of Mrs. Hubbard\u2019s compartment was locked when he came in answer to her bell.\u201d\n\u201cThat is so Monsieur\u201d said the conductor.",
    "\u201cThat is why I thought the lady must have been\ndreaming.\u201d\n\u201cBut now it is easy\u201d continued M. Bouc.",
    "\u201cDoubtless he meant to relock the communicating\ndoor also but perhaps he heard some movement from the bed and it startled him.\u201d\n\u201cWe have now\u201d said Poirot \u201conly to find the scarlet kimono.\u201d\n\u201cTrue.",
    "And these last two compartments are occupied by men.\u201d\n\u201cWe will search all the same.\u201d\n\u201cOh assuredly.",
    "Besides I remember what you said.\u201d\nHector MacQueen acquiesced willingly in the search.",

    "\u201cI feel I\u2019m definitely the most suspicious character on the train.",
    "You\u2019ve only got\nto find a will in which the old man left me all his money and that\u2019ll just about fix things.\u201d\nM. Bouc bent a suspicious glance upon him.",

    "I\u2019m no linguist myself but I know what I call Shopping and\nHotel\u2014snappy bits in French and German and Italian.\u201d\nHis voice was a little louder than usual.",

    "They moved on to the last compartment.",
    "The examination of the luggage of the big Italian and\nof the valet yielded no result.",
    "The three men stood at the end of the coach looking at each other.",
    "\u201cWhat next\u201d said M. Bouc.",
    "\u201cWe will go back to the diningcar\u201d said Poirot.",

    "His nod seemed to say\n\u201cQuite right.",
    "That is the proper thing to say.",
    "You have given me the cue I expected.\u201d\nHe sat very upright threw out his chest caressed his moustache and spoke in the manner of a\npractised speaker addressing a public meeting.",
    "\u201cMy friends I have reviewed the facts in my mind and have also gone over to myself the\nevidence of the passengers\u2014with this result I see nebulously as yet a certain explanation that\nwould cover the facts as we know them.",

    "Remember also the passenger who\nfailed to turn up.",
    "He is I think significant.",
    "Then there are some minor points that strike me as\nsuggestive\u2014for instance the position of Mrs. Hubbard\u2019s spongebag the name of Mrs.\nArmstrong\u2019s mother the detective methods of M. Hardman the suggestion of M. MacQueen that\nRatchett himself destroyed the charred note we found Princess Dragomiroff\u2019s Christian name\nand a grease spot on a Hungarian passport.\u201d\nThe two men stared at him.",
    "\u201cDo they suggest anything to you those points\u201d asked Poirot.",
    "\u201cNot a thing\u201d said M. Bouc frankly.",
    "\u201cAnd M. le docteur\u201d\n\u201cI do not understand in the least what you are talking of.\u201d\nM. Bouc meanwhile seizing upon the one tangible thing his friend had mentioned was\nsorting through the passports.",
    "With a grunt he picked up that of Count and Countess Andrenyi\nand opened it.",
    "\u201cIs this what you mean This dirty mark\u201d\n\u201cYes.",
    "It is a fairly fresh grease spot.",
    "You notice where it occurs\u201d\n\u201cAt the beginning of the description of the Count\u2019s wife\u2014her Christian name to be exact.",
    "But\nI confess that I still do not see the point.\u201d\n\u201cI am going to approach it from another angle.",
    "Let us go back to the handkerchief found at the\nscene of the crime.",
    "As we stated not long ago three people are associated with the letter H Mrs.\nHubbard Miss Debenham and the maid Hildegarde Schmidt.",
    "Now let us regard that\nhandkerchief from another point of view.",
    "It is my friends an extremely expensive\nhandkerchief\u2014an objet de luxe handmade embroidered in Paris.",
    "Which of the passengers\napart from the initial was likely to own such a handkerchief Not Mrs. Hubbard a worthy\nwoman with no pretensions to reckless extravagance in dress.",
    "Not Miss Debenham\u2014that class of\nEnglishwoman has a dainty linen handkerchief not an expensive wisp of cambric costing\nperhaps two hundred francs.",
    "And certainly not the maid.",
    "But there are two women on the tram\nwho would be likely to own such a handkerchief.",
    "Let us see if we can connect them in any way\nwith the letter H. The two women I refer to are Princess Dragomiroff\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWhose Christian name is Natalia\u201d put in M. Bouc ironically.",
    "\u201cExactly.",
    "And her Christian name as I said just now is decidedly suggestive.",
    "The other\nwoman is Countess Andrenyi.",
    "And at once something strikes us\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou\u201d\n\n110\n\n\fAgatha Christie \u0099 MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS\n\n\u201cMe then.",
    "Her Christian name on her passport is disfigured by a blob of grease.",
    "just an\naccident anyone would say.",
    "But consider that Christian name.",
    "Elena.",
    "Suppose that instead of\nElena it were Helena.",
    "That capital H could be turned into a capital E and then run over the small\ne next to it quite easily\u2014and then a spot of grease dropped to cover up the alteration.\u201d\n\u201cHelena\u201d cried M. Bouc.",
    "\u201cIt is an idea that.\u201d\n\u201cCertainly it is an idea I look about for any confirmation however slight of my idea\u2014and I\nfind it.",
    "One of the luggage labels on the Countess\u2019s baggage is slightly damp.",
    "It is one that\nhappens to run over the first initial on top of the case.",
    "That label has been soaked off and put on\nagain in a different place.\u201d\n\u201cYou begin to convince me\u201d said M. Bouc.",
    "\u201cBut the Countess Andrenyi\u2014surely\u2014\u201d\n\u201cAh now mon vieux you must turn yourself round and approach an entirely different angle\nof the case.",
    "How was this murder intended to appear to everybody Do not forget that the snow\nhas upset all the murderer\u2019s original plan.",
    "Let us imagine for a little minute that there is no\nsnow that the train proceeded on its normal course.",
    "What then would have happened\n\u201cThe murder let us say would still have been discovered in all probability at the Italian\nfrontier early this morning.",
    "Much of the same evidence would have been given to the Italian\npolice.",
    "The threatening letters would have been produced by M. MacQueen M. Hardman would\nhave told his story Mrs. Hubbard would have been eager to tell how a man passed through her\ncompartment the button would have been found.",
    "I imagine that two things only would have been\ndifferent.",
    "The man would have passed through Mrs. Hubbard\u2019s compartment just before one\no\u2019clock\u2014and the Wagon Lit uniform would have been found cast off in one of the toilets.\u201d\n\u201cYou mean\u201d\n\u201cI mean that the murder was planned to look like an outside job.",
    "It would have been presumed\nthat the assassin had left the train at Brod where it is timed to arrive at 0.58.",
    "Somebody would\nprobably have passed a strange Wagon Lit conductor in the corridor.",
    "The uniform would be left\nin a conspicuous place so as to show clearly just how the trick had been played.",
    "No suspicion\nwould have attached to the passengers.",
    "That my friends was how the affair was intended to\nappear to the outside world.",
    "\u201cBut the accident to the train changes everything.",
    "Doubtless we have here the reason why the\nman remained in the compartment with his victim so long.",
    "He was waiting for the train to go on.",
    "But at last he realised that the train was not going on.",
    "Different plans would have to be made.",
    "The murderer would now be known to be still on the train.\u201d\n\u201cYes yes\u201d said M. Bouc impatiently.",
    "\u201cI see all that.",
    "But where does the handkerchief come\nin\u201d\n\u201cI am returning to it by a somewhat circuitous route.",
    "To begin with you must realise that the\nthreatening letters were in the nature of a blind.",
    "They might have been lifted bodily out of an\nindifferently written American crime novel.",
    "They are not real.",
    "They are in fact simply intended\nfor the police.",
    "What we have to ask ourselves is \u2018Did they deceive Ratchett\u2019 On the face of it\nthe answer seems to be No.",
    "His instructions to Hardman seem to point to a definite \u2018private\u2019\nenemy of whose identity he was well aware.",
    "That is if we accept Hardman\u2019s story as true.",
    "But\nRatchett certainly received one letter of a very different character\u2014the one containing a\nreference to the Armstrong baby a fragment of which we found in his compartment.",
    "In case\nRatchett had not realised it sooner this was to make sure that he understood the reason of the\nthreats against his life.",
    "That letter as I have said all along was not intended to be found.",
    "The\nmurderer\u2019s first care was to destroy it.",
    "This then was the second hitch in his plans.",
    "The first was\nthe snow the second was our reconstruction of that fragment.",
    "111\n\n\fAgatha Christie \u0099 MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS\n\n\u201cThat the note was destroyed so carefully can mean only one thing.",
    "There must be on the train\nsomeone so intimately connected with the Armstrong family that the finding of that note would\nimmediately direct suspicion upon that person.",
    "\u201cNow we come to the other two clues that we found.",
    "I pass over the pipecleaner.",
    "We have\nalready said a good deal about that.",
    "Let us pass on to the handkerchief.",
    "Taken at its simplest it is\na clue which directly incriminates someone whose initial is H and it was dropped there\nunwittingly by that person.\u201d\n\u201cExactly\u201d said Dr. Constantine.",
    "\u201cShe finds out that she has dropped the handkerchief and\nimmediately takes steps to conceal her Christian name.\u201d\n\u201cHow fast you go You arrive at a conclusion much sooner than I would permit myself to do.\u201d\n\u201cIs there any other alternative\u201d\n\u2018Certainly there is.",
    "Suppose for instance that you have committed a crime and wish to cast\nthe blame for it on someone else.",
    "Well there is on the train a certain person connected intimately\nwith the Armstrong family\u2014a woman.",
    "Suppose then that you leave there a handkerchief\nbelonging to that woman.",
    "She will be questioned her connection with the Armstrong family will\nbe brought out\u2014et voil\u00e0 motive\u2014and an incriminating article of evidence.\u201d\n\u201cBut in such a case\u201d objected the doctor \u201cthe person indicated being innocent would not\ntake steps to conceal her identity.\u201d\n\u201cAh really That is what you think That is truly the opinion of the police court.",
    "But I know\nhuman nature my friend and I tell you that suddenly confronted with the possibility of being\ntried for murder the most innocent person will lose his head and do the most absurd things.",
    "No\nno the grease spot and the changed label do not prove guilt\u2014they only prove that the Countess\nAndrenyi is anxious for some reason to conceal her identity.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you think her connection with the Armstrong family can be She has never been in\nAmerica she says.\u201d\n\u201cExactly and she speaks English with a foreign accent and she has a very foreign appearance\nwhich she exaggerates.",
    "But it should not be difficult to guess who she is.",
    "I mentioned just now\nthe name of Mrs. Armstrong\u2019s mother.",
    "It was \u2018Linda Arden\u2019 and she was a very celebrated\nactress\u2014among other things a Shakespearean actress.",
    "Think of As You Like It with the Forest of\nArden and Rosalind.",
    "It was there she got the inspiration for her acting name.",
    "\u2018Linda Arden\u2019 the\nname by which she was known all over the world was not her real name.",
    "It may have been\nGoldenberg it is quite likely that she had Central European blood in her veins\u2014a strain of\nJewish perhaps.",
    "Many nationalities drift to America.",
    "I suggest to you gentlemen that that\nyoung sister of Mrs. Armstrong\u2019s little more than a child at the time of the tragedy was Helena\nGoldenberg the younger daughter of Linda Arden and that she married Count Andrenyi when\nhe was an attach\u00e9 in Washington.\u201d\n\u201cBut Princess Dragomiroff says that the girl married an Englishman.\u201d\n\u201cWhose name she cannot remember I ask you my friends is that really likely Princess\nDragomiroff loved Linda Arden as great ladies do love great artists.",
    "She was godmother to one\nof the actress\u2019s daughters.",
    "Would she forget so quickly the married name of the other daughter\nIt is not likely.",
    "No I think we can safely say that Princess Dragomiroff was lying.",
    "She knew\nHelena was on the train she had seen her.",
    "She realised at once as soon as she heard who\nRatchett really was that Helena would be suspected.",
    "And so when we question her as to the\nsister she promptly lies\u2014is vague cannot remember but \u2018thinks Helena married an\nEnglishman\u2019\u2014a suggestion as far away from the truth as possible.\u201d\n\n112\n\n\fAgatha Christie \u0099 MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS\n\nOne of the restaurant attendants came through the door at the end and approached them.",
    "He\naddressed M. Bouc.",
    "\u201cThe dinner Monsieur shall I serve it It is ready some little time.\u201d\nM. Bouc looked at Poirot.",
    "The latter nodded.",
    "\u201cBy all means let dinner be served.\u201d\nThe attendant vanished through the doors at the other end.",

    "The company assembled in the restaurant car was a very subdued one.",
    "They spoke little.",
    "Even\nthe loquacious Mrs. Hubbard was unnaturally quiet.",
    "She murmured as she sat\n\u201cI don\u2019t feel as though I had the heart to eat anything\u201d and then partook of everything offered\nher encouraged by the Swedish lady who seemed to regard her as a special charge.",
    "Before the meal was served Poirot had caught the chief attendant by the sleeve and\nmurmured something to him.",
    "Constantine made a pretty good guess as to what the instructions\nhad been when he noticed that the Count and Countess Andrenyi were always served last and\nthat at the end of the meat there was a delay in making out their bill.",
    "It therefore came about that\nthe Count and Countess were the last left in the restaurant car.",
    "When they rose at length and moved in the direction of the door Poirot sprang up and\nfollowed them.",
    "\u201cPardon Madame you have dropped your handkerchief.\u201d\nHe was holding out to her the tiny monogrammed square.",
    "She took it glanced at it then handed it back to him.",
    "\u201cYou are mistaken Monsieur that is not\nmy handkerchief.\u201d\n\u201cNot your handkerchief Are you sure\u201d\n\u201cPerfectly sure Monsieur.\u201d\n\u201cAnd yet Madame it has your initial\u2014the initial H.\u201d\nThe Count made a sudden movement.",
    "Poirot ignored him.",
    "His eyes were fixed on the\nCountess\u2019s face.",
    "Looking steadily at him she replied\n\u201cI do not understand Monsieur.",
    "My initials are E. A.\u201d\n\u201cI think not.",

    "Both the Count and the Countess had gone\ndeadly white.",
    "Poirot said in a gentler tone \u201cIt is of no use denying.",
    "That is the truth is it not\u201d\nThe Count burst out furiously \u201cI demand Monsieur by what right you\u2014\u201d\nShe interrupted him putting up a small hand towards his mouth.",
    "\u201cNo Rudolph.",
    "Let me speak.",
    "It is useless to deny what this gentleman says.",
    "We had better sit\ndown and talk the matter out.\u201d\nHer voice had changed.",
    "It still had the southern richness of tone but it had become suddenly\nmore clear cut and incisive.",
    "It was for the first time a definitely American voice.",
    "The Count was silenced.",
    "He obeyed the gesture of her hand and they both sat down opposite\nPoirot.",
    "\u201cYour statement Monsieur is quite true\u201d said the Countess.",
    "\u201cI am Helena Goldenberg the\nyounger sister of Mrs. Armstrong.\u201d\n\u201cYou did not acquaint me with that fact this morning Madame la Comtesse.\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\n114\n\n\fAgatha Christie \u0099 MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS\n\n\u201cIn fact all that your husband and you told me was a tissue of lies.\u201d\n\u201cMonsieur\u201d cried the Count angrily.",
    "\u201cDo not be angry Rudolph.",
    "M. Poirot puts the fact rather brutally but what he says is\nundeniable.\u201d\n\u201cI am glad you admit the fact so freely Madame.",
    "Will you now tell me your reasons for that\nand also for altering your Christian name on your passport\u201d\n\u201cThat was my doing entirely\u201d put in the Count.",
    "Helena said quietly \u201cSurely M. Poirot you can guess my reason\u2014our reason.",
    "This man who\nwas killed is the man who murdered my baby niece who killed my sister who broke my brotherinlaw\u2019s heart.",

    "\u201cI give you my word of honour that last night Helena\nnever left her compartment.",
    "She took a sleeping draught exactly as I said.",

    "\u201cAnd yet you took it upon yourself to alter the name in the passport\u201d\n\u201cMonsieur Poirot\u201d the Count said earnestly and passionately \u201cconsider my position.",
    "Do you\nthink I could stand the thought of my wife dragged through a sordid police case She was\ninnocent I knew it but what she said was true\u2014because of her connection with the Armstrong\nfamily she would have been immediately suspected.",
    "She would have been questioned\u2014attested\nperhaps.",
    "Since some evil chance had taken us on the same train as this man Ratchett there was I\nfelt sure but one thing for it.",
    "I admit Monsieur that I lied to you\u2014all that is save in one thing.",

    "It would be bitter indeed for you to have your wife dragged into an\nunpleasant police case.",
    "With that I can sympathise.",

    "\u201cYou are enticing me to admit that after all it is mine But indeed M.\nPoirot it isn\u2019t.\u201d She spoke with great earnestness.",
    "\u201cThen why if the handkerchief was not yours did you alter the name in the passport\u201d\nThe Count answered this.",
    "115\n\n\fAgatha Christie \u0099 MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS\n\n\u201cBecause we heard that a handkerchief had been found with the initial H on it.",
    "We talked the\nmatter over together before we came to be interviewed.",

    "Princess Dragomiroff was looking at Poirot with a very direct glance.",
    "\u201cHow do you explain\nthe evidence of my maid Monsieur\u201d\n\u201cVery simply Madame.",
    "Your maid recognised the handkerchief I showed her as yours.",
    "She\nsomewhat clumsily tried to shield you.",
    "She did encounter the man but earlier\u2014while the train\nwas at Vincovci station.",

    "But do not abandon this one too abruptly.",
    "You may agree with it later.\u201d\nHe turned back again to face the others.",
    "\u201cThere is another possible solution of the crime.",
    "This is how I arrived at it.",
    "\u201cWhen I had heard all the evidence I leaned back and shut my eyes and began to think.",
    "Certain points presented themselves to me as worthy of attention.",
    "I enumerated these points to\nmy two colleagues.",
    "Some I have already elucidated\u2014such as a grease spot on a passport and so\non.",
    "I will run over the points that remain.",
    "The first and most important is a remark made to me by\n\n131\n\n\fAgatha Christie \u0099 MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS\n\nM.

    "In America there might be a household\ncomposed of just such varied nationalities\u2014an Italian chauffeur an English governess a\nSwedish nurse a German lady\u2019smaid and so on.",
    "That led me to my scheme of \u2018guessing\u2019\u2014that\nis casting each person for a certain part in the Armstrong drama much as a producer casts a play.",
    "Well that gave me an extremely interesting and satisfactory result.",
    "\u201cI had also examined in my own mind each separate person\u2019s evidence with some curious\nresults.",
    "Take first the evidence of Mr. MacQueen.",
    "My first interview with him was entirely\nsatisfactory.",
    "But in my second he made rather a curious remark.",
    "I had described to him the\nfinding of a note mentioning the Armstrong case.",
    "He said \u2018But surely\u2014\u2019 and then paused and\nwent on \u2018I mean\u2014that was rather careless of the old man.\u2019\n\u201cNow I could feel that that was not what he had started out to say.",
    "Supposing what he had\nmeant to say was \u2018But surely that was burnt\u2019 In which case MacQueen knew of the note and of\nits destruction\u2014in other words he was either the murderer or an accomplice of the murderer.",
    "Very good.",
    "\u201cThen the valet.",
    "He said his master was in the habit of taking a sleeping draught when\ntravelling by train.",
    "That might be true but would Ratchett have taken one last night The\nautomatic under his pillow gave the lie to that statement.",
    "Ratchett intended to be on the alert last\nnight.",
    "Whatever narcotic was administered to him must have been given without his knowledge.",
    "By whom Obviously by MacQueen or the valet.",
    "\u201cNow we come to the evidence of Mr. Hardman.",
    "I believed all that he told me about his own\nidentity but when it came to the actual methods he had employed to guard Mr. Ratchett his\nstory was neither more nor less than absurd.",
    "The only way to have protected Ratchett effectively\nwas to pass the night actually in his compartment or in some spot where he could watch the door.",
    "The one thing that his evidence did show plainly was that no one in any other part of the train\ncould possibly have murdered Ratchett.",
    "It drew a clear circle round the StamboulCalais\ncarriage.",
    "That seemed to me a rather curious and inexplicable fact and I put it aside to think\nover.",
    "\u201cYou probably all know by now of the few words I overheard between Miss Debenham and\nColonel Arbuthnot.",
    "The interesting thing to my mind was the fact that Colonel Arbuthnot called\nher Mary and was clearly on terms of intimacy with her.",
    "But the Colonel was supposed to have\nmet her only a few days previously.",
    "And I know Englishmen of the Colonel\u2019s type\u2014even if he\nhad fallen in love with the young lady at first sight he would have advanced slowly and with\ndecorum not rushing things.",
    "Therefore I concluded that Colonel Arbuthnot and Miss Debenham\nwere in reality well acquainted and were for some reason pretending to be strangers.",
    "Another\nsmall point was Miss Debenham\u2019s easy familiarity with the term \u2018long distance\u2019 for a telephone\ncall.",
    "Yet Miss Debenham had told me that she had never been in the States.",
    "\u201cTo pass to another witness.",
    "Mrs. Hubbard had told us that lying in bed she had been unable\nto see whether the communicating door was bolted or not and so had asked Miss Ohlsson to see\nfor her.",
    "Now\u2014though her statement would have been perfectly true if she had been occupying\ncompartment No.",
    "2 4 12 or any even number in which the bolt is directly under the handle of\nthe door\u2014in the uneven numbers such as compartment No.",
    "3 the bolt is well above the handle\n\n132\n\n\fAgatha Christie \u0099 MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS\n\nand could not therefore be masked by the spongebag in the least.",
    "I was forced to the conclusion\nthat Mrs. Hubbard was inventing an incident that had never occurred.",
    "\u201cAnd here let me say just a word or two about times.",
    "To my mind the really interesting point\nabout the dented watch is the place where it was found\u2014in Ratchett\u2019s pyjama pocket a\nsingularly uncomfortable and unlikely place to keep one\u2019s watch especially as there is a watch\n\u2018hook\u2019 provided just by the head of the bed.",
    "I felt sure therefore that the watch had been\ndeliberately placed in the pocket\u2014faked.",
    "The crime then was not committed at a quarter past\none.",
    "\u201cWas it then committed earlier To be exact at twentythree minutes to one My friend M.\nBouc advanced as an argument in favour of it the loud cry which awoke me from sleep.",
    "But if\nRatchett had been heavily drugged he could not have cried out.",
    "If he had been capable of crying\nout he would have been capable of making some kind of struggle to defend himself and there\nwere no signs of any such struggle.",
    "\u201cI remembered that MacQueen had called attention not once but twice and the second time\nin a very blatant manner to the fact that Ratchett could speak no French.",
    "I came to the\nconclusion that the whole business at twentythree minutes to one was a comedy played for my\nbenefit Anyone might see through the watch business\u2014it is a common enough device in\ndetective stories.",
    "They assumed that I should see through it and that pluming myself on my own\ncleverness I would go on to assume that since Ratchett spoke no French the voice I heard at\ntwentythree minutes to one could not have been his and that Ratchett must have been already\ndead.",
    "But I am convinced that at twentythree minutes to one Ratchett was still lying in his\ndrugged sleep.",
    "\u201cBut the device has succeeded I have opened my door and looked out.",
    "I have actually heard\nthe French phrase used.",
    "If I am so unbelievably dense as not to realise the significance of that\nphrase it must be brought to my attention.",
    "If necessary MacQueen can come right out in the\nopen.",
    "He can say \u2018Excuse me M. Poirot that can\u2019t have been Mr. Ratchett speaking.",
    "He\ncouldn\u2019t speak French.\u2019\n\u201cNow what was the real time of the crime And who killed him\n\u201cIn my opinion\u2014and this is only an opinion\u2014Ratchett was killed at some time very close\nupon two o\u2019clock the latest hour the doctor gives us as possible.",
    "\u201cAs to who killed him\u2014\u201d\nHe paused looking at his audience.",
    "He could not complain of any lack of attention.",
    "Every eye\nwas fixed upon him.",
    "In the stillness you could have heard a pin drop.",
    "He went on slowly\n\u201cI was particularly struck by the extraordinary difficulty of proving a case against any one\nperson on the train and by the rather curious coincidence that in each case the testimony giving\nan alibi came from what I might describe as an \u2018unlikely\u2019 person.",
    "Thus Mr. MacQueen and\nColonel Arbuthnot provided alibis for each other\u2014two persons between whom it seemed most\nunlikely there should have been any prior acquaintanceship.",
    "The same thing happened with the\nEnglish valet and the Italian and with the Swedish lady and the English girl.",
    "I said to myself\nThis is extraordinary\u2014they cannot all be in it\n\u201cAnd then Messieurs I saw light.",
    "They were all in it.",
    "For so many people connected with the\nArmstrong case to be travelling by the same train through coincidence was not only unlikely it\nwas impossible.",
    "It must be not chance but design.",
    "I remembered a remark of Colonel\nArbuthnot\u2019s about trial by jury.",
    "A jury is composed of twelve people\u2014there were twelve\npassengers\u2014Ratchett was stabbed twelve times.",
    "And the thing that had worried me all along\u2014\n\n133\n\n\fAgatha Christie \u0099 MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS\n\nthe extraordinary crowd travelling in the StamboulCalais coach at a slack time of year\u2014this was\nexplained.",
    "\u201cRatchett had escaped justice in America.",
    "There was no question as to his guilt.",
    "I visualised a\nselfappointed jury of twelve people who had condemned him to death and who by the\nexigencies of the case had themselves been forced to be his executioners.",
    "And immediately on\nthat assumption the whole case fell into beautiful shining order.",
    "\u201cI saw it as a perfect mosaic each person playing his or her allotted part.",
    "It was so arranged\nthat if suspicion should fall on any one person the evidence of one or more of the others would\nclear the accused person and confuse the issue.",
    "Hardman\u2019s evidence was necessary in case some\noutsider should be suspected of the crime and be unable to prove an alibi.",
    "The passengers in the\nStamboul carriage were in no danger.",
    "Every minute detail of their evidence was worked out\nbeforehand.",
    "The whole thing was a very cleverly planned jigsaw puzzle so arranged that every\nfresh piece of knowledge that came to light made the solution of the whole more difficult.",
    "As my\nfriend M. Bouc remarked the case seemed fantastically impossible That was exactly the\nimpression intended to be conveyed.",
    "\u201cDid this solution explain everything Yes it did.",
    "The nature of the wounds\u2014each inflicted\nby a different person.",
    "The artificial threatening letters\u2014artificial since they were unreal written\nonly to be produced as evidence.",
    "Doubtless there were real letters warning Ratchett of his fate\nwhich MacQueen destroyed substituting for them these others.",
    "Then Hardman\u2019s story of being\ncalled in by Ratchett\u2014a lie of course from beginning to end.",
    "The description of the mythical\n\u2018small dark man with a womanish voice\u2019\u2014a convenient description since it had the merit of not\nincriminating any of the actual Wagon Lit conductors and would apply equally well to a man or\na woman.",
    "\u201cThe idea of stabbing is at first sight a curious one but on reflection nothing else would fit the\ncircumstances so well.",
    "A dagger was a weapon that could be used by everyone\u2014strong or\nweak\u2014and it made no noise.",
    "I fancy though I may be wrong that each person in turn entered\nRatchett\u2019s darkened compartment through that of Mrs. Hubbard\u2014and struck They themselves\nwould never know which blow actually killed him.",
    "\u201cThe final letter which Ratchett had probably found on his pillow was carefully burnt.",
    "With\nno clue pointing to the Armstrong case there would be absolutely no reason for suspecting any of\nthe passengers on the train.",
    "It would be put down as an outside job and the \u2018small dark man with\nthe womanish voice\u2019 would actually have been seen by one or more of the passengers leaving the\ntrain at Brod\n\u201cI do not know exactly what happened when the conspirators discovered that this part of their\nplan was impossible owing to the accident to the train.",
    "There was I imagine a hasty\nconsultation and then they decided to go through with it.",
    "It was true that now one and all of the\npassengers were bound to come under suspicion but that possibility had already been foreseen\nand provided for.",
    "The only additional thing to be done was to confuse the issue even further.",
    "Two socalled \u2018clues\u2019 were dropped in the dead man\u2019s compartment\u2014one incriminating Colonel\nArbuthnot who had the strongest alibi and whose connection with the Armstrong family was\nprobably the hardest to prove and the second clue the handkerchief incriminating Princess\nDragomiroff who by virtue of her social position her particularly frail physique and the alibi\ngiven her by her maid and the conductor was practically in an unassailable position.",
    "\u201cFurther to confuse the issue a red herring was drawn across the trail\u2014the mythical woman\nin the red kimono.",
    "Again I am to bear witness to this woman\u2019s existence.",
    "There is a heavy bang\nat my door.",
    "I get up and look out\u2014and see the scarlet kimono disappearing in the distance.",
    "A\n\n134\n\n\fAgatha Christie \u0099 MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS\n\njudicious selection of people\u2014the conductor Miss Debenham and MacQueen\u2014will also have\nseen her.",
    "It was I think someone with a sense of humour who thoughtfully placed the scarlet\nkimono on the top of my suitcase whilst I was interviewing people in the diningcar.",
    "Where the\ngarment came from in the first place I do not know.",
    "I suspect it is the property of Countess\nAndrenyi since her luggage contained only a chiffon negligee so elaborate as to be rather a teagown than a dressinggown.",
    "\u201cWhen MacQueen first learned that the letter which had been so carefully burnt had in part\nescaped destruction and that the word Armstrong was exactly the word remaining he must at\nonce have communicated his news to the others.",
    "It was at this minute that the position of\nCountess Andrenyi became acute and her husband immediately took steps to alter the passport.",
    "It was their second piece of bad luck\n\u201cThey one and all agreed to deny utterly any connection with the Armstrong family.",
    "They\nknew I had no immediate means of finding out the truth and they did not believe that I should go\ninto the matter unless my suspicions were aroused against one particular person.",
    "\u201cNow there was one further point to consider.",
    "Allowing that my theory of the crime was the\ncorrect one and I believed that it must be the correct one then obviously the Wagon Lit\nconductor himself must be privy to the plot.",
    "But if so that gave us thirteen persons not twelve.",
    "Instead of the usual formula \u2018Of so many people one is guilty\u2019 I was faced with the problem that\nof thirteen persons one and one only was innocent.",
    "Which was that person\n\u201cI came to a very odd conclusion.",
    "I came to the conclusion that the person who had taken no\npart in the crime was the person who would be considered the most likely to do so.",
    "I refer to\nCountess Andrenyi.",
    "I was impressed by the earnestness of her husband when he swore to me\nsolemnly on his honour that his wife never left her compartment that night.",
    "I decided that Count\nAndrenyi took so to speak his wife\u2019s place.",
    "\u201cIf so then Pierre Michel was definitely one of the twelve.",
    "But how could one explain his\ncomplicity He was a decent man who had been many years in the employ of the company\u2014not\nthe kind of man who could be bribed to assist in a crime.",
    "Then Pierre Michel must be involved in\nthe Armstrong case.",
    "But that seemed very improbable.",
    "Then I remembered that the dead nurserymaid had been French.",
    "Supposing that that unfortunate girl had been Pierre Michel\u2019s daughter.",
    "That would explain everything\u2014it would also explain the place chosen for the staging of the\ncrime.",
    "Were there any others whose part in the drama was not clear Colonel Arbuthnot I put\ndown as a friend of the Armstrongs.",
    "They had probably been through the War together.",
    "The\nmaid Hildegarde Schmidt\u2014I could guess her place in the Armstrong household.",
    "I am perhaps\nover greedy but I sense a good cook instinctively.",
    "I laid a trap for her\u2014she fell into it.",
    "I said I\nknew she was a good cook.",
    "She answered \u2018Yes indeed all my ladies have said so.\u2019 But if you\nare employed as a lady\u2019smaid your employers seldom have a chance of learning whether or not\nyou are a good cook.",
    "\u201cThen there was Hardman.",
    "He seemed quite definitely not to belong to the Armstrong\nhousehold.",
    "I could only imagine that he had been in love with the French girl.",
    "I spoke to him of\nthe charm of foreign women\u2014and again I obtained the reaction I was looking for.",
    "Sudden tears\ncame into his eyes which he pretended were dazzled by the snow.",
    "\u201cThere remains Mrs. Hubbard.",
    "Now Mrs. Hubbard let me say played the most important part\nin the drama.",
    "By occupying the compartment communicating with that of Ratchett she was more\nopen to suspicion than anyone else.",
    "In the nature of things she could not have an alibi to fall back\nupon.",
    "To play the part she played\u2014the perfectly natural slightly ridiculous American fond\n\n135\n\n\fAgatha Christie \u0099 MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS\n\nmother\u2014an artist was needed.",
    "But there was an artist connected with the Armstrong family Mrs.\nArmstrong\u2019s mother\u2014Linda Arden the actress .",
    "...\u201d\nHe stopped.",
    "Then in a soft rich dreamy voice quite unlike the one she had used throughout the journey\nMrs. Hubbard said\n\u201cI always fancied myself in comedy parts.\u201d\nShe went on still dreamily\n\u201cThat slip about the spongebag was silly.",
    "It shows that you should always rehearse property.",
    "We tried it on the way out\u2014I was in an evennumber compartment then I suppose.",
    "I never\nthought of the bolts being in different places.\u201d\nShe shifted her position a little and looked straight at Poirot.",
    "\u201cYou know all about it M. Poirot.",
    "You\u2019re a very wonderful man.",
    "But even you can\u2019t quite\nimagine what it was like\u2014that awful day in New York.",
    "I was just crazy with grief so were the\nservants.",
    "And Colonel Arbuthnot was there too.",
    "He was John Armstrong\u2019s best friend.\u201d\n\u201cHe saved my life in the War\u201d said Arbuthnot.",
    "\u201cWe decided then and there perhaps we were mad\u2014I don\u2019t know that the sentence of death\nthat Cassetti had escaped had got to be carried out.",
    "There were twelve of us\u2014or rather eleven\nSusanne\u2019s father was over in France of course.",
    "First we thought we\u2019d draw lots as to who should\ndo it but in the end we decided on this way.",
    "It was the chauffeur Antonio who suggested it.",
    "Mary worked out all the details later with Hector MacQueen.",
    "He\u2019d always adored Sonia\u2014my\ndaughter\u2014and it was he who explained to us exactly how Cassetti\u2019s money had managed to get\nhim off.",
    "\u201cIt took a long time to perfect our plan.",
    "We had first to track Ratchett down.",
    "Hardman\nmanaged that in the end.",
    "Then we had to try and get Masterman and Hector into his\nemployment\u2014or at any rate one of them.",
    "Well we managed that.",
    "Then we had a consultation\nwith Susanne\u2019s father.",
    "Colonel Arbuthnot was very keen on having twelve of us.",
    "He seemed to\nthink it made it more in order.",
    "He didn\u2019t like the stabbing idea much but he agreed that it did\nsolve most of our difficulties.",
    "Well Susanne\u2019s father was willing.",
    "Susanne had been his only\nchild.",
    "We knew from Hector that Ratchett would be coming back from the East sooner or later\nby the Orient Express.",
    "With Pierre Michel actually working on that train the chance was too\ngood to be missed.",
    "Besides it would be a good way of not incriminating any outsiders.",
    "\u201cMy daughter\u2019s husband had to know of course and he insisted on coming on the train with\nher.",
    "Hector wangled it so that Ratchett selected the right day for travelling when Michel would\nbe on duty.",
    "We meant to engage every carriage in the StamboulCalais coach but unfortunately\nthere was one carriage we couldn\u2019t get.",
    "It had been reserved long beforehand for a director of the\ncompany.",
    "\u2018Mr.",
    "Harris\u2019 of course was a myth.",
    "But it would have been awkward to have any\nstranger in Hector\u2019s compartment.",
    "And then at the last minute you came.",
    "...\u201d\nShe stopped.",
    "\u201cWell\u201d she said \u201cyou know everything now M. Poirot.",
    "What are you going to do about it If\nit must all come out can\u2019t you lay the blame upon me and me only I would have stabbed that\nman twelve times willingly.",
    "It wasn\u2019t only that he was responsible for my daughter\u2019s death and\nher child\u2019s and that of the other child who might have been alive and happy now.",
    "It was more\nthan that there had been other children kidnapped before Daisy and there might be others in the\nfuture.",
    "Society had condemned him\u2014we were only carrying out the sentence.",
    "But it\u2019s\nunnecessary to bring all these others into it.",
    "All these good faithful souls\u2014and poor Micheland\nMary and Colonel Arbuthnot\u2014they love each other.",
    "...\u201d\n\n136\n\n\fAgatha Christie \u0099 MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS\n\nHer voice was wonderful echoing through the crowded space\u2014that deep emotional heartstirring voice that had thrilled many a New York audience.",
    "Poirot looked at his friend.",
    "\u201cYou are a director of the company M. Bouc\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cWhat do you say\u201d\nM. Bouc cleared his throat.",
    "\u201cIn my opinion M. Poirot\u201d he said \u201cthe first theory you put forward was the correct one\u2014\ndecidedly so.",
    "I suggest that that is the solution we offer to the JugoSlavian police when they\narrive.",
    "You agree doctor\u201d\n\u201cCertainly I agree\u201d said Dr. Constantine.",
    "\u201cAs regards the medical evidence I think\u2014er\u2014that\nI made one or two fantastic suggestions.\u201d\n\u201cThen\u201d said Poirot \u201chaving placed my solution before you I have the honour to retire from\nthe case.",
