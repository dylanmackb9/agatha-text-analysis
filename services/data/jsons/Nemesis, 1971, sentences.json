    "NEMESIS\n\nAgatha Christie\n\n\fChapter 1\n\nOVERTURE\n\nIn the afternoons it was the custom of Miss Jane Marple to unfold her\nsecond newspaper.",
    "Two newspapers were delivered at her house\nevery morning.",
    "The first one Miss Marple read while sipping her early\nmorning tea that is if it was delivered in time.",
    "The boy who delivered\nthe papers was notably erratic in his management of time.",
    "Frequently\ntoo there was either a new boy or a boy who was acting temporarily\nas a standin for the first one.",
    "And each one would have ideas of his\nown as to the geographical route that he should take in delivering.",
    "Perhaps it varied monotony for him.",
    "But those customers who were\nused to reading their papers early so that they could snap up the more\nsaucy items in the days news before departing for their bus train or\nother means of progress to the days work were annoyed if the papers\nwere late though the middleaged and elderly ladies who resided\npeacefully in St Mary Mead often preferred to read a newspaper\npropped up on their breakfast table.",
    "Today Miss Marple had absorbed the front page and a few other items\nin the daily paper that she had nicknamed the Daily AllSorts this\nbeing a slightly satirical allusion to the fact that her paper the Daily\nNewsgiver owing to a change of proprietor to her own and to other of\n\n\fher friends great annoyance now provided articles on mens tailoring\nwomens dress female heartthrobs competitions for children and\ncomplaining letters from women and had managed pretty well to shove\nany real news off any part of it but the front page or to some obscure\ncorner where it was impossible to find it.",
    "Miss Marple being oldfashioned preferred her newspapers to be newspapers and give you\nnews.",
    "In the afternoon having finished her luncheon treated herself to\ntwenty minutes nap in a specially purchased upright armchair which\ncatered for the demands of her rheumatic back she had opened The\nTimes which lent itself still to a more leisurely perusal.",
    "Not that The\nTimes was what it used to be.",
    "The maddening thing about The Times\nwas that you couldnt find anything any more.",
    "Instead of going through\nfrom the front page and knowing where everything else was so that\nyou passed easily to any special articles on subjects in which you were\ninterested there were now extraordinary interruptions to this timehonoured programme.",
    "Two pages were suddenly devoted to travel in\nCapri with illustrations.",
    "Sport appeared with far more prominence than\nit had ever had in the old days.",
    "Court news and obituaries were a little\nmore faithful to routine.",
    "The births marriages and deaths which had at\none time occupied Miss Marples attention first of all owing to their\nprominent position had migrated to a different part of The Times\nthough of late Miss Marple noted they had come almost permanently\nto rest on the back page.",
    "Miss Marple gave her attention first to the main news on the front\npage.",
    "She did not linger long on that because it was equivalent to what\nshe had already read this morning though possibly couched in a\nslightly more dignified manner.",
    "She cast her eye down the table of\n\n\fcontents.",
    "Articles comments science sport then she pursued her\nusual plan turned the paper over and had a quick run down the births\nmarriages and deaths after which she proposed to turn to the page\ngiven to correspondence where she nearly always found something to\nenjoy from that she passed on to the Court Circular on which page\ntodays news from the Sale Rooms could also be found.",
    "A short article\non Science was often placed there but she did not propose to read\nthat.",
    "It seldom made sense for her.",
    "Having turned the paper over as usual to the births marriages and\ndeaths Miss Marple thought to herself as so often before Its sad\nreally but nowadays one is only interested in the deaths\n\nPeople had babies but the people who had babies were not likely to be\neven known by name to Miss Marple.",
    "If there had been a column\ndealing with babies labelled as grandchildren there might have been\nsome chance of a pleasurable recognition.",
    "She might have thought to\nherself Really Mary Prendergast has had a third granddaughter\nthough even that perhaps might have been a bit remote.",
    "She skimmed down Marriages also with not a very close survey\nbecause most of her old friends daughters or sons had married some\nyears ago already.",
    "She came to the Deaths column and gave that her\nmore serious attention.",
    "Gave it enough in fact so as to be sure she\nwould not miss a name.",
    "Alloway Angopastro Arden Barton\nBedshaw Burgoweisser... dear me what a German name but he\nseemed to be late of Leeds.",
    "Carpenter Camperdown Clegg.",

    "No she hadnt known her.",
    "Quantril Dear me that\nmust be Elizabeth Quantril.",

    "Deeply\nloved by her husband and children.",
    "Well very nice or very sad.",
    "Whichever way you liked to look at it.",
    "Miss Marple laid down her paper glancing idly through the crossword\nwhile she puzzled to remember why the name Rafiel was familiar to\nher.",
    "It will come to me said Miss Marple knowing from long experience\nthe way old peoples memories worked.",
    "Itll come to me I have no doubt.",
    "She glanced out of the window towards the garden withdrew her gaze\nand tried to put the garden out of her mind.",
    "Her garden had been the\nsource of great pleasure and also a great deal of hard work to Miss\nMarple for many many years.",
    "And now owing to the fussiness of\ndoctors working in the garden was forbidden to her.",
    "Shed once tried\nto fight this ban but had come to the conclusion that she had after all\nbetter do as she was told.",
    "She had arranged her chair at such an angle\n\n\fas not to be easy to look out in the garden unless she definitely and\nclearly wished to see something in particular.",
    "She sighed picked up\nher knitting bag and took out a small childs woolly jacket in process of\ncoming to a conclusion.",
    "The back was done and the front.",
    "Now she\nwould have to get on with the sleeves.",
    "Sleeves were always boring.",
    "Two sleeves both alike.",

    "It isnt good for\nyou.",
    "Well she hadnt wished to get mixed up in any murders but it just\nhappened.",
    "That was all.",
    "Simply because of an elderly Major with a\nglass eye who had insisted on telling her some very long and boring\nstories.",
    "Poor Major  now what was his name Shed forgotten that\nnow.",
    "Mr Rafiel and his secretary Mrs... Mrs Walters yes Esther\nWalters and his masseurattendant Jackson.",
    "It all came back.",
    "Well\nwell.",
    "Poor Mr Rafiel.",
    "So Mr Rafiel was dead.",
    "He had known he was\ngoing to die before very long.",
    "He had practically told her so.",
    "It seemed\nas though he had lasted longer than the doctors had thought.",
    "He was a\nstrong man an obstinate man  a very rich man.",
    "Miss Marple remained in thought her knitting needles working\nregularly but her mind not really on her knitting.",
    "Her mind was on the\nlate Mr Rafiel and remembering what she could remember about him.",
    "Not an easy man to forget really.",
    "She could conjure his appearance up\nmentally quite well.",
    "Yes a very definite personality a difficult man an\nirritable man shockingly rude sometimes.",
    "Nobody ever resented his\nbeing rude though.",
    "She remembered that also.",
    "They didnt resent his\nbeing rude because he was so rich.",
    "Yes he had been very rich.",
    "He had\nhad his secretary with him and a valet attendant a qualified masseur.",
    "He had not been able to get about very well without help.",
    "Rather a doubtful character that nurseattendant had been Miss\nMarple thought.",
    "Mr Rafiel had been very rude to him sometimes.",
    "He\nhad never seemed to mind.",
    "And that again of course was because Mr\nRafiel was so rich.",
    "Nobody else would pay him half what I do Mr Rafiel had said and\nhe knows it.",
    "Hes good at his job though.",
    "Miss Marple wondered whether Jackson Johnson had stayed on\nwith Mr Rafiel.",
    "Stayed on for what must have been  another year A\nyear and three or four months.",
    "She thought probably not.",
    "Mr Rafiel\nwas one who liked a change.",
    "He got tired of people tired of their ways\ntired of their faces tired of their voices.",
    "Miss Marple understood that.",
    "She had felt the same sometimes.",
    "That\ncompanion of hers that nice attentive maddening woman with her\ncooing voice.",
    "Ah said Miss Marple what a change for the better since  oh dear\nshed forgotten her name now Miss  Miss Bishop no not Miss Bishop\nof course not.",
    "Why had she thought of the name Bishop.",
    "Oh dear how\ndifficult it was.",
    "Her mind went back to Mr Rafiel and to  no it wasnt Johnson it had\nbeen Jackson Arthur Jackson.",
    "Oh dear said Miss Marple again I always get all the names wrong.",

    "Why do I think of her as Miss Bishop The answer came to her.",
    "Chess\nof course.",
    "A chess piece.",
    "A knight.",
    "A bishop.",
    "I shall be calling her Miss Castle next time I think of her I suppose or\nMiss Rook.",
    "Though really shes not the sort of person who would ever\nrook anybody.",
    "No indeed.",
    "And now what was the name of that nice\nsecretary that Mr Rafiel had.",
    "Oh yes Esther Walters.",
    "That was right.",
    "I\nwonder what has happened to Esther Walters Shed inherited money\nShe would probably inherit money now.",
    "Mr Rafiel she remembered had told her something about that or she\nhad  oh dear what a muddle things were when you tried to remember\nwith any kind of exactitude.",
    "Esther Walters.",
    "It had hit her badly that\nbusiness in the Caribbean but she would have got over it.",
    "Shed been\na widow hadnt she Miss Marple hoped that Esther Walters had\nmarried again some nice kindly reliable man.",
    "It seemed faintly\nunlikely.",
    "Esther Walters she thought had had rather a genius for\nliking the wrong kind of men to marry.",
    "Miss Marple went back to thinking about Mr Rafiel.",
    "No flowers it had\nsaid.",
    "Not that she herself would have dreamed of sending flowers to\nMr Rafiel.",
    "He could buy up all the nurseries in England if hed wanted\nto.",
    "And anyway they hadnt been on those terms.",
    "They hadnt been\nfriends or on terms of affection.",
    "They had been what was the word she\n\n\fwanted  allies.",
    "Yes they had been allies for a very short time.",
    "A very\nexciting time.",
    "And he had been an ally worth having.",
    "She had known\nso.",
    "Shed known it as she had gone running through a dark tropical\nnight in the Caribbean and had come to him.",
    "Yes she remembered\nwearing that pink shawlscarf shed been wearing  what used they to\ncall them when she was young  a fascinator.",
    "That nice pink shawlscarf of wool that she had put round her head he had looked at her\nand laughed and later when she had said  she smiled at the\nremembrance  one word she had used and he had laughed but he\nhadnt laughed in the end.",
    "No hed done what she asked him and\ntherefore  Ah Miss Marple sighed it had been she had to admit it\nall very exciting.",
    "And shed never told her nephew or dear Joan about\nit because after all it was what theyd told her not to do wasnt it\nMiss Marble nodded her head.",
    "Then softly she murmured\n\nPoor Mr Rafiel I hope he didnt suffer.",
    "Probably not.",
    "Probably hed been kept by expensive sedatives easing\nthe end.",
    "He had suffered a great deal in those weeks in the Caribbean.",
    "Hed nearly always been in pain.",
    "A brave man.",
    "A brave man.",
    "She was sorry he was dead because she thought that\nthough hed been elderly and an invalid and ill the world had lost\nsomething through his going.",
    "She had no idea what he could have\nbeen like in business.",
    "Ruthless she thought and rude and overmastering and aggressive.",
    "A great attacker.",
    "But  but a good friend\nshe thought.",
    "And somewhere in him a deep kind of kindness that he\nwas very careful never to show on the surface.",
    "A man she admired and\nrespected.",
    "Well she was sorry he was gone and she hoped he hadnt\nminded too much and that his passing had been easy.",
    "And now he\n\n\fwould be cremated no doubt and put in some large handsome marble\nvault.",
    "She didnt even know if hed been married.",
    "He had never\nmentioned a wife never mentioned children.",
    "A lonely man Or had his\nlife been so full that he hadnt needed to feel lonely She wondered.",
    "She sat there quite a long time that afternoon wondering about Mr\nRafiel.",
    "She had never expected to see him again after she had\nreturned to England and she never had seen him again.",
    "Yet in some\nqueer way she could at any moment have felt she was in touch with\nhim.",
    "If he had approached her or had suggested that they meet again\nfeeling perhaps a bond because of a life that had been saved between\nthem or of some other bond.",
    "A bond.",
    "Surely said Miss Marple aghast at an idea that had come into her\nmind there cant be a bond of ruthlessness between us Was she\nJane Marple could she ever be ruthless\n\nDyou know said Miss Marple to herself its extraordinary I never\nthought about it before.",
    "I believe you know I could be ruthless \n\nThe door opened and a dark curly head was popped in.",
    "It was Cherry\nthe welcome successor to Miss Bishop Miss Knight.",
    "Did you say something said Cherry.",
    "I was speaking to myself said Miss Marple I just wondered if I\ncould ever be ruthless.",
    "What you said Cherry.",
    "Never Youre kindness itself.",
    "All the same said Miss Marple I believe I could be ruthless if there\nwas due cause.",
    "What would you call due cause\n\nIn the cause of justice said Miss Marple.",
    "You did have it in for little Gary Hopkins I must say said Cherry.",
    "When you caught him torturing his cat that day.",
    "Never knew you had\nit in you to go for anyone like that Scared him stiff you did.",
    "Hes never\nforgotten it.",
    "I hope he hasnt tortured any more cats.",
    "Well hes made sure you werent about if he did said Cherry.",
    "In fact\nIm not at all sure as there isnt other boys as got scared.",
    "Seeing you\nwith your wool and the pretty things you knits and all that anyone\nwould think you were gentle as a lamb.",
    "But theres times I could say\nyoud behave like a lion if you was goaded into it.",
    "Miss Marple looked a little doubtful.",
    "She could not quite see herself in\nthe role in which Cherry was now casting her.",
    "Had she ever  she\npaused on the reflection recalling various moments  there had been\nintense irritation with Miss Bishop Knight.",
    "Really she must not forget\nnames in this way.",
    "But her irritation had shown itself in more or less\nironical remarks.",
    "Lions presumably did not use irony.",
    "There was\nnothing ironical about a lion.",
    "It sprang.",
    "It roared.",
    "It used its claws\npresumably it took large bites at its prey.",
    "Really said Miss Marple I dont think I have ever behaved quite like\nthat.",
    "Walking slowly along her garden that evening with the usual feelings of\nvexation rising in her Miss Marple considered the point again.",
    "Possibly\nthe sight of a plant of snapdragons recalled it to her mind.",
    "Really she\nhad told old George again and again that she only wanted sulphurcoloured antirrhinums not that rather ugly purple shade that\ngardeners always seemed so fond of.",
    "Sulphur yellow said Miss\nMarple aloud.",
    "Someone the other side of the railing that abutted on the lane past her\nhouse turned her head and spoke.",
    "I beg your pardon You said something\n\nI was talking to myself Im afraid said Miss Marple turning to look\nover the railing.",
    "This was someone she did not know and she knew most people in St\nMary Mead.",
    "Knew them by sight even if not personally.",
    "It was a\nthickset woman in a shabby but tough tweed skirt and wearing good\ncountry shoes.",
    "She wore an emerald pullover and a knitted woollen\nscarf.",
    "Im afraid one does at my age added Miss Marple.",
    "Nice garden youve got here said the other woman.",
    "Not particularly nice now said Miss Marple.",
    "When I could attend to\nit myself \n\nOh I know.",
    "I understand just what you feel.",
    "I suppose youve got one\nof those amateurs.",
    "I have a lot of names for them mostly very rude elderly chaps who say they know all about gardening.",
    "Sometimes they\ndo sometimes they dont know a thing about it.",
    "They come and have a\nlot of cups of tea and do a little very mild weeding.",
    "Theyre quite nice\nsome of them but all the same it does make ones temper rise.",
    "She\nadded Im quite a keen gardener myself.",
    "Do you live here asked Miss Marple with some interest.",
    "Well Im boarding with a Mrs Hastings.",
    "I think Ive heard her speak of\nyou.",
    "Youre Miss Marple arent you\n\nOh yes.",
    "Ive come as a sort of companiongardener.",
    "My name is Bartlett by\nthe way.",
    "Miss Bartlett.",
    "Theres not really much to do there said Miss\nBartlett.",
    "She goes in for annuals and all that.",
    "Nothing you can really\nget your teeth into.",
    "She opened her mouth and showed her teeth\nwhen making this remark.",
    "Of course I do a few odd jobs as well.",
    "Shopping you know and things like that.",
    "Anyway if you want any time\nput in here I could put in an hour or two for you.",
    "Id say I might be\nbetter than any chap youve got now.",
    "That would be easy said Miss Marple.",
    "I like flowers best.",
    "Dont care\nso much for vegetables.",
    "I do vegetables for Mrs Hastings.",
    "Dull but necessary.",
    "Well Ill be\ngetting along.",
    "Her eyes swept over Miss Marple from head to foot as\nthough memorising her then she nodded cheerfully and tramped off.",
    "Mrs Hastings Miss Marple couldnt remember the name of any Mrs\nHastings.",
    "Certainly Mrs Hastings was not an old friend.",
    "She had\ncertainly never been a gardening chum.",
    "Ah of course it was probably\nthose newly built houses at the end of Gibraltar Road.",
    "Several families\nhad moved in in the last year.",
    "Miss Marple sighed looked again with\nannoyance at the antirrhinums saw several weeds which she yearned\nto root up one or two exuberant suckers she would like to attack with\nher secateurs and finally sighing and manfully resisting temptation\nshe made a detour round by the lane and returned to her house.",
    "Her\nmind recurred again to Mr Rafiel.",
    "They had been he and she  what\nwas the title of that book they used to quote so much when she was\nyoung Ships that pass in the night.",
    "Rather apt it was really when she\ncame to think of it.",
    "Ships that pass in the night...",
    "It was in the night that\nshe had gone to him to ask  no to demand help.",
    "To insist to say no\ntime must be lost.",
    "And he had agreed and put things in train at once\nPerhaps she had been rather lionlike on that occasion No.",
    "No that\nwas quite wrong.",
    "It had not been anger she had felt.",
    "It had been\ninsistence on something that was absolutely imperative to be put in\nhand at once.",
    "And hed understood.",
    "Poor Mr Rafiel.",
    "The ship that had passed in the night had been an\ninteresting ship.",
    "Once you got used to his being rude he might have\nbeen quite an agreeable man No She shook her head.",
    "Mr Rafiel could\nnever have been an agreeable man.",
    "Well she must put Mr Rafiel out of\nher head.",
    "Ships that pass in the night and speak each other in passing\n\nOnly a signal shown and a distant voice in the darkness.",
    "She would probably never think of him again.",
    "She would look out\nperhaps to see if there was an obituary of him in The Times.",
    "But she\ndid not think it was very likely.",
    "He was not a very well known\ncharacter she thought.",
    "Not famous.",
    "He had just been very rich.",
    "Of\ncourse many people did have obituaries in the paper just because\nthey were very rich but she thought that Mr Rafiels richness would\npossibly not have been of that kind.",
    "He had not been prominent in any\ngreat industry he had not been a great financial genius or a\nnoteworthy banker.",
    "He had just all his life made enormous amounts of\nmoney...\n\nChapter 2\n\nCODE WORD NEMESIS\n\nIt was about a week or so after Mr Rafiels death that Miss Marple\npicked up a letter from her breakfast tray and looked at it for a\nmoment before opening it.",
    "The other two letters that had come by this\n\n\fmornings post were bills or just possibly receipts for bills.",
    "In either\ncase they were not of any particular interest.",
    "This letter might be.",
    "A London postmark typewritten address a long good quality\nenvelope.",
    "Miss Marple slit it neatly with the paper knife she always\nkept handy on her tray.",
    "It was headed Messrs. Broadribb and\nSchuster Solicitors and Notaries Public with an address in\nBloomsbury.",
    "It asked her in suitable courteous and legal phraseology\nto call upon them one day in the following week at their office to\ndiscuss a proposition that might be to her advantage.",
    "Thursday the\n24th was suggested.",
    "If that date was not convenient perhaps she\nwould let them know what date she would be likely to be in London in\nthe near future.",
    "They added that they were the solicitors to the late Mr\nRafiel with whom they understood she had been acquainted.",
    "Miss Marple frowned in some slight puzzlement.",
    "She got up rather\nmore slowly than usual thinking about the letter she had received.",
    "She\nwas escorted downstairs by Cherry who was meticulous in hanging\nabout in the hall so as to make sure that Miss Marple did not come to\ngrief walking by herself down the staircase which was of the oldfashioned kind which turned a sharp corner in the middle of its run.",
    "You take very good care of me Cherry said Miss Marple.",
    "Got to said Cherry in her usual idiom.",
    "Good people are scarce.",
    "Well thank you for the compliment said Miss Marple arriving safely\nwith her last foot on the ground floor.",
    "Nothing the matter is there asked Cherry.",
    "You look a bit rattled\nlike if you know what I mean.",
    "No nothings the matter said Miss Marple.",
    "I had rather an unusual\nletter from a firm of solicitors.",
    "Nobody is suing you for anything are they said Cherry who was\ninclined to regard solicitors letters as invariably associated with\ndisaster of some kind.",
    "Oh no I dont think so said Miss Marple.",
    "Nothing of that kind.",
    "They\njust asked me to call upon them next week in London.",
    "Perhaps youve been left a fortune said Cherry hopefully.",
    "That I think is very unlikely said Miss Marple.",
    "Well you never know said Cherry.",
    "Settling herself in her chair and taking her knitting out of its\nembroidered knitting bag Miss Marple considered the possibility of Mr\nRafiel having left her a fortune.",
    "It seemed even more unlikely than\nwhen Cherry had suggested it.",
    "Mr Rafiel she thought was not that\nkind of a man.",
    "It was not possible for her to go on the date suggested.",
    "She was\nattending a meeting of the Womens Institute to discuss the raising of a\nsum for building a small additional couple of rooms.",
    "But she wrote\nnaming a day in the following week.",
    "In due course her letter was\nanswered and the appointment definitely confirmed.",
    "She wondered\n\n\fwhat Messrs. Broadribb and Schuster were like.",
    "The letter had been\nsigned by J.R. Broadribb who was apparently the senior partner.",
    "It\nwas possible Miss Marple thought that Mr Rafiel might have left her\nsome small memoir or souvenir in his will.",
    "Perhaps some book on rare\nflowers that had been in his library and which he thought would please\nan old lady who was keen on gardening.",
    "Or perhaps a cameo brooch\nwhich had belonged to some greataunt of his.",
    "She amused herself by\nthese fancies.",
    "They were only fancies she thought because in either\ncase it would merely be a case of the Executors  if these lawyers were\nthe Executors  forwarding her by post any such object.",
    "They would\nnot have wanted an interview.",
    "Oh well said Miss Marple I shall know next Tuesday.",
    "Wonder what shell be like said Mr Broadribb to Mr Schuster\nglancing at the clock as he did so.",
    "Shes due in a quarter of an hour said Mr Schuster.",
    "Wonder if shell\nbe punctual\n\nOh I should think so.",
    "Shes elderly I gather and much more\npunctilious than the young scatterbrains of today.",
    "Fat or thin I wonder said Mr Schuster.",
    "Mr Broadribb shook his head.",
    "Didnt Rafiel ever describe her to you asked Mr Schuster.",
    "He was extraordinarily cagey in everything he said about her.",
    "The whole thing seems very odd to me said Mr Schuster.",
    "If we only\nknew a bit more about what it all meant...",
    "It might be said Mr Broadribb thoughtfully something to do with\nMichael.",
    "What After all these years Couldnt be.",
    "What put that into your\nhead Did he mention \n\nNo he didnt mention anything.",
    "Gave me no clue at all as to what was\nin his mind.",
    "Just gave me instructions.",
    "Think he was getting a bit eccentric and all that towards the end\n\nNot in the least.",
    "Mentally he was as brilliant as ever.",
    "His physical illhealth never affected his brain anyway.",
    "In the last two months of his\nlife he made an extra two hundred thousand pounds.",
    "Just like that.",
    "He had a flair said Mr Schuster with due reverence.",
    "Certainly he\nalways had a flair.",
    "A great financial brain said Mr Broadribb also in a tone of\nreverence suitable to the sentiment.",
    "Not many like him mores the\npity.",
    "A buzzer went on the table.",
    "Mr Schuster picked up the receiver.",
    "A\nfemale voice said\n\n\fMiss Jane Marple is here to see Mr Broadribb by appointment.",
    "Mr Schuster looked at his partner raising an eyebrow for an\naffirmative or a negative.",
    "Mr Broadribb nodded.",
    "Show her up said Mr Schuster.",
    "And he added Now well see.",
    "Miss Marple entered a room where a middleaged gentleman with a\nthin spare body and a long rather melancholy face rose to greet her.",
    "This apparently was Mr Broadribb whose appearance somewhat\ncontradicted his name.",
    "With him was a rather younger middleaged\ngentleman of definitely more ample proportions.",
    "He had black hair\nsmall keen eyes and a tendency to a double chin.",
    "My partner Mr Schuster Mr Broadribb presented.",
    "I hope you didnt feel the stairs too much said Mr Schuster.",
    "Seventy\nif she is a day nearer eighty perhaps he was thinking in his own\nmind.",
    "I always get a little breathless going upstairs.",
    "An oldfashioned building this said Mr Broadribb apologetically.",
    "No\nlift.",
    "Ah well we are a very long established firm and we dont go in for\nas many of the modern gadgets as perhaps our clients expect of us.",
    "This room has very pleasant proportions said Miss Marple politely.",
    "She accepted the chair that Mr Broadribb drew forward for her.",
    "Mr\nSchuster in an unobtrusive sort of way left the room.",
    "I hope that chair is comfortable said Mr Broadribb.",
    "Ill pull that\ncurtain slightly shall I You may feel the sun a little too much in your\neyes.",
    "Thank you said Miss Marple gratefully.",
    "She sat there upright as was her habit.",
    "She wore a light tweed suit a\nstring of pearls and a small velvet toque.",
    "To himself Mr Broadribb was\nsaying The Provincial Lady.",
    "A good type.",
    "Fluffy old girl.",
    "May be\nscatty may not.",
    "Quite a shrewd eye.",
    "I wonder where Rafiel came\nacross her.",
    "Somebodys aunt perhaps up from the country While\nthese thoughts passed through his head he was making the kind of\nintroductory small talk relating to the weather the unfortunate effects\nof late frosts early in the year and such other remarks as he\nconsidered suitable.",
    "Miss Marple made the necessary responses and sat placidly awaiting\nthe opening of preliminaries to the meeting.",
    "You will be wondering what all this is about said Mr Broadribb\nshifting a few papers in front of him and giving her a suitable smile.",
    "Youve heard no doubt of Mr Rafiels death or perhaps you saw it in\nthe paper.",
    "I saw it in the paper said Miss Marple.",
    "He was I understand a friend of yours.",
    "I met him first just over a year ago said Miss Marple.",
    "In the West\nIndies she added.",
    "Ah.",
    "I remember.",
    "He went out there I believe for his health.",
    "It did him\nsome good perhaps but he was already a very ill man badly crippled\nas you know.",
    "Yes said Miss Marple.",

    "We were fellow visitors in\nan hotel.",
    "We had occasional conversations.",
    "I never saw him again\nafter my return to England.",
    "I live very quietly in the country you see\nand I gather that he was completely absorbed in business.",
    "He continued transacting business right up... well I could almost say\nright up to the day of his death said Mr Broadribb.",
    "A very fine\nfinancial brain.",
    "I am sure that was so said Miss Marple.",
    "I realised quite soon that he\nwas a... well a very remarkable character altogether.",
    "I dont know if you have any idea... whether youve been given any\nidea at some time by Mr Rafiel as to what this proposition is that I have\nbeen instructed to put up to you\n\n\fI cannot imagine said Miss Marple what possible kind of\nproposition Mr Rafiel might have wanted to put up to me.",
    "It seems most\nunlikely.",
    "He had a very high opinion of you.",
    "That is kind of him but hardly justified said Miss Marple.",
    "I am a very\nsimple person.",
    "As you no doubt realise he died a very rich man.",
    "The provisions of his\nWill are on the whole fairly simple.",
    "He had already made dispositions\nof his fortune some time before his death.",
    "Trusts and other beneficiary\narrangements.",
    "That is I believe very usual procedure nowadays said Miss Marple\nthough I am not at all cognisant of financial matters myself.",
    "The purpose of this appointment said Mr Broadribb is that I am\ninstructed to tell you that a sum of money has been laid aside to\nbecome yours absolutely at the end of one year but conditional on\nyour accepting a certain proposition with which I am to make you\nacquainted.",
    "He took from the table in front of him a long envelope.",
    "It was sealed.",
    "He passed it across the table to her.",
    "It would be better I think that you should read for yourself of what\nthis consists.",
    "There is no hurry.",
    "Take your time.",
    "Miss Marple took her time.",
    "She availed herself of a small paper knife\nwhich Mr Broadribb handed to her slit up the envelope took out the\nenclosure one sheet of typewriting and read it.",
    "She folded it up again\nthen reread it and looked at Mr Broadribb.",
    "This is hardly very definite.",
    "Is there no more definite elucidation of\nany kind\n\nNot so far as I am concerned.",
    "I was to hand you this and tell you the\namount of the legacy.",
    "The sum in question is twenty thousand pounds\nfree of legacy duty.",
    "Miss Marple sat looking at him.",
    "Surprise had rendered her speechless.",
    "Mr Broadribb said no more for the moment.",
    "He was watching her\nclosely.",
    "There was no doubt of her surprise.",
    "It was obviously the last\nthing Miss Marple had expected to hear.",
    "Mr Broadribb wondered what\nher first words would be.",
    "She looked at him with the directness the\nseverity that one of his own aunts might have done.",
    "When she spoke it\nwas almost accusingly.",
    "That is a very large sum of money said Miss Marple.",
    "Not quite so large as it used to be said Mr Broadribb and just\nrestrained himself from saying Mere chicken feed nowadays.",
    "I must admit said Miss Marple that I am amazed.",
    "Frankly quite\namazed.",
    "She picked up the document and read it carefully through again.",
    "I gather you know the terms of this she said.",
    "Yes.",
    "It was dictated to me personally by Mr Rafiel.",
    "Did he not give you any explanation of it\n\nNo he did not.",
    "You suggested I suppose that it might he better if he did said Miss\nMarple.",
    "There was a slight acidity in her voice now.",
    "Mr Broadribb smiled faintly.",
    "You are quite right.",
    "That is what I did.",
    "I said that you might find it\ndifficult to oh to understand exactly what he was driving at.",
    "Very remarkable said Miss Marple.",
    "There is no need of course said Mr Broadribb for you to give me\nan answer now.",
    "No said Miss Marple I should have to reflect upon this.",
    "It is as you have pointed out quite a substantial sum of money.",
    "I am old said Miss Marple.",
    "Elderly we say but old is a better word.",
    "Definitely old.",
    "It is both possible and indeed probable that I might not\nlive as long as a year to earn this money in the rather doubtful case\nthat I was able to earn it\n\n\fMoney is not to be despised at any age said Mr Broadribb.",
    "I could benefit certain charities in which I have an interest said Miss\nMarple and there are always people.",
    "People whom one wishes one\ncould do a little something for but ones own funds do not admit of it.",
    "And then I will not pretend that there are not pleasures and desires things that one has not been able to indulge in or to afford.",
    "I think Mr\nRafiel knew quite well that to be able to do so quite unexpectedly\nwould give an elderly person a great deal of pleasure.",
    "Yes indeed said Mr Broadribb.",
    "A cruise abroad perhaps One of\nthese excellent tours as arranged nowadays.",
    "Theatres concerts the\nability to replenish ones cellars.",
    "My tastes would be a little more moderate than that said Miss\nMarple.",
    "Partridges she said thoughtfully it is very difficult to get partridges\nnowadays and theyre very expensive.",
    "I should enjoy a partridge  a\nwhole partridge  to myself very much.",
    "A box of marrons glac\u00e9s are an\nexpensive taste which I cannot often gratify.",
    "Possibly a visit to the\nopera.",
    "It means a car to take one to Covent Garden and back and the\nexpense of a night in an hotel.",
    "But I must not indulge in idle chat she\nsaid.",
    "I will take this back with me and reflect upon it.",
    "Really what on\nearth made Mr Rafiel  you have no idea why he should have suggested\nthis particular proposition and why he should think that I could be of\nservice to him in any way He must have known that it was over a year\nnearly two years since he had seen me and that I might have got much\nmore feeble than I have and much more unable to exercise such small\ntalents as I might have.",
    "He was taking a risk.",
    "There are other people\n\n\fsurely much better qualified to undertake an investigation of this\nnature\n\nFrankly one would think so said Mr Broadribb but he selected you\nMiss Marple.",
    "Forgive me if this is idle curiosity but have you had  oh\nhow shall I put it  any connection with crime or the investigation of\ncrime\n\nStrictly speaking I should say no said Miss Marple.",
    "Nothing\nprofessional that is to say.",
    "I have never been a probation officer or\nindeed sat as a magistrate on a Bench or been connected in any way\nwith a detective agency.",
    "To explain to you Mr Broadribb which I think\nis only fair for me to do and which I think Mr Rafiel ought to have done\nto explain it in any way all I can say is that during our stay in the West\nIndies we both Mr Rafiel and myself had a certain connection with a\ncrime that took place there.",
    "A rather unlikely and perplexing murder.",
    "And you and Mr Rafiel solved it\n\nI should not put it quite like that said Miss Marple.",
    "Mr Rafiel by the\nforce of his personality and I by putting together one or two obvious\nindications that came to my notice were successful in preventing a\nsecond murder just as it was about to take place.",
    "I could not have\ndone it alone I was physically far too feeble.",
    "Mr Rafiel could not have\ndone it alone he was a cripple.",
    "We acted as allies however.",
    "Just one other question I should like to ask you Miss Marple.",
    "Does the\nword Nemesis mean anything to you\n\n\fNemesis said Miss Marple.",
    "It was not a question.",
    "A very slow and\nunexpected smile dawned on her face.",
    "Yes she said it does mean\nsomething to me.",
    "It meant something to me and it meant something to\nMr Rafiel.",
    "I said it to him and he was much amused by my describing\nmyself by that name.",
    "Whatever Mr Broadribb had expected it was not that.",
    "He looked at\nMiss Marple with something of the same astonished surprise that Mr\nRafiel had once felt in a bedroom by the Caribbean sea.",
    "A nice and\nquite intelligent old lady.",
    "But really...",
    "Nemesis\n\nYou feel the same I am sure said Miss Marple.",
    "She rose to her feet.",
    "If you should find or receive any further instructions in this matter\nyou will perhaps let me know Mr Broadribb.",
    "It seems to me\nextraordinary that there should not be something of that kind.",
    "This\nleaves me entirely in the dark really as to what Mr Rafiel is asking me\nto do or try to do.",
    "You are not acquainted with his family his friends his...\n\nNo.",
    "I told you.",
    "He was a fellow traveller in a foreign part of the world.",
    "We had a certain association as allies in a very mystifying matter.",
    "That\nis all.",
    "As she was about to go to the door she turned suddenly and\nasked He had a secretary Mrs Esther Walters.",
    "Would it be infringing\netiquette if I asked if Mr Rafiel left her fifty thousand pounds\n\n\fHis bequest will appear in the press said Mr Broadribb.",
    "I can\nanswer your question in the affirmative... Mrs Walterss name is now\nMrs Anderson by the way.",
    "She has remarried.",
    "I am glad to hear that.",
    "She was a widow with one daughter and she\nwas a very adequate secretary it appears.",
    "She understood Mr Rafiel\nvery well.",
    "A nice woman.",
    "I am glad she has benefited.",
    "That evening Miss Marple sitting in her straightbacked chair her feet\nstretched out to the fireplace where a small wood fire was burning\nowing to the sudden cold spell which as is its habit can always\ndescend on England at any moment selected by itself took once more\nfrom the long envelope the document delivered to her that morning.",
    "Still in a state of partial unbelief she read murmuring the words here\nand there below her breath as though to impress them on her mind\n\nTo Miss Jane Marple resident in the village of St Mary Mead.",
    "This will be delivered to you after my death by the good offices of my\nsolicitor James Broadribb.",
    "He is the man I employ for dealing with\nsuch legal matters as fall in the field of my private affairs not my\nbusiness activities.",
    "He is a sound and trustworthy lawyer.",
    "Like the\nmajority of the human race he is susceptible to the sin of curiosity.",
    "I\nhave not satisfied his curiosity.",
    "In some respects this matter will\nremain between you and myself.",
    "Our code word my dear lady is\nNemesis.",
    "I dont think you will have forgotten in what place and in what\n\n\fcircumstances you first spoke that word to me.",
    "In the course of my\nbusiness activities over what is now quite a long life I have learnt one\nthing about a man whom I wish to employ.",
    "He has to have flair.",
    "A flair\nfor the particular job I want him to do.",
    "It is not knowledge it is not\nexperience.",
    "The only word that describes it is flair.",
    "A natural gift for\ndoing a certain thing.",
    "You my dear if I may call you that have a natural flair for justice and\nthat has led to your having a natural flair for crime.",
    "I want you to\ninvestigate a certain crime.",
    "I have ordered a certain sum to be placed\nso that if you accept this request and as a result of your investigation\nthis crime is probably elucidated the money will become yours\nabsolutely.",
    "I have set aside a year for you to engage on this mission.",
    "You are not young but you are if I may say so tough.",
    "I think I can trust\na reasonable fate to keep you alive for a year at least.",
    "I think the work involved will not be distasteful to you.",
    "You have a\nnatural genius I should say for investigation.",
    "The necessary funds for\nwhat I may describe as working capital for making this investigation\nwill be remitted to you during that period whenever necessary.",
    "I offer\nthis to you as an alternative to what may be your life at present.",
    "I envisage you sitting in a chair a chair that is agreeable and\ncomfortable for whatever kind or form of rheumatism from which you\nmay suffer.",
    "All persons of your age I consider are likely to suffer from\nsome form of rheumatism.",
    "If this ailment affects your knees or your\nback it will not be easy for you to get about much and you will spend\nyour time mainly in knitting.",
    "I see you as I saw you once one night as I\nrose from sleep disturbed by your urgency in a cloud of pink wool.",
    "I envisage you knitting more jackets head scarves and a good many\nother things of which I do not know the name.",
    "If you prefer to continue\nknitting that is your decision.",

    "Chapter 3\n\nMISS MARPLE TAKES ACTION\n\nMiss Marple read this letter three times then she laid it aside and sat\nfrowning slightly while she considered the letter and its implications.",
    "The first thought that came to her was that she was left with a\nsurprising lack of definite information.",
    "Would there be any further\ninformation coming to her from Mr Broadribb Almost certainly she felt\nthat there would be no such thing.",
    "That would not have fitted in with Mr\n\n\fRafiels plan.",
    "Yet how on earth could Mr Rafiel expect her to do\nanything to take any course of action in a matter about which she\nknew nothing.",
    "It was intriguing.",
    "After a few minutes more for\nconsideration she decided that Mr Rafiel had meant it to be intriguing.",
    "Her thoughts went back to him for the brief time that she had known\nhim.",
    "His disability his bad temper his flashes of brilliance of\noccasional humour.",
    "Hed enjoy she thought teasing people.",
    "He had\nbeen enjoying she felt and this letter made it almost certain baffling\nthe natural curiosity of Mr Broadribb.",
    "There was nothing in the letter he had written her to give her the\nslightest clue as to what this business was all about.",
    "It was no help to\nher whatsoever.",
    "Mr Rafiel she thought had very definitely not meant it\nto be of any help.",
    "He had had  how could she put it  other ideas.",
    "All\nthe same she could not start out into the blue knowing nothing.",
    "This\ncould almost be described as a crossword puzzle with no clues given.",
    "There would have to be clues.",
    "She would have to know what she was\nwanted to do where she was wanted to go whether she was to solve\nsome problem sitting in her armchair and laying aside her knitting\nneedles in order to concentrate better.",
    "Or did Mr Rafiel intend her to\ntake a plane or a boat to the West Indies or to South America or to\nsome other specially directed spot She would either have to find out\nfor herself what it was she was meant to do or else she would have to\nreceive definite instructions.",
    "He might think she had sufficient\ningenuity to guess at things to ask questions to find out that way No\nshe couldnt quite believe that.",
    "If he does think that said Miss Marple aloud hes gaga.",
    "I mean he\nwas gaga before he died.",
    "But she didnt think Mr Rafiel would have been gaga.",
    "I shall receive\ninstructions said Miss Marple.",
    "But what instructions and when\n\nIt was only then that it occurred to her suddenly that without noticing it\nshe had definitely accepted the mandate.",
    "She spoke aloud again\naddressing the atmosphere.",
    "I believe in eternal life said Miss Marple.",
    "I dont know exactly where\nyou are Mr Rafiel but I have no doubt that you are somewhere.",
    "I will\ndo my best to fulfil your wishes.",
    "II\n\nIt was three days later when Miss Marple wrote to Mr Broadribb.",
    "It was\na very short letter keeping strictly to the point.",
    "Dear Mr Broadribb\n\nI have considered the suggestion you made to me and I am letting you\nknow that I have decided to accept the proposal made to me by the\nlate Mr Rafiel.",
    "I shall do my best to comply with his wishes though I am\nnot at all assured of success.",
    "Indeed I hardly see how it is possible for\n\n\fme to be successful.",
    "I have been given no direct instructions in his\nletter and have not been  I think the term is briefed  in any way.",
    "If you\nhave any further communication you are holding for me which sets out\ndefinite instructions I should be glad if you will send it to me but I\nimagine that as you have not done so that is not the case.",
    "I presume that Mr Rafiel was of sound mind and disposition when he\ndied I think I am justified in asking if there has been recently in his life\nany criminal affair in which he might possibly have been interested\neither in the course of his business or in his personal relations.",
    "Has he\never expressed to you any anger or dissatisfaction with some notable\nmiscarriage of justice about which he felt strongly If so I think I\nshould be justified in asking you to let me know about it.",
    "Has any\nrelation or connection of his suffered some hardship lately been the\nvictim of some unjust dealing or what might be considered as such\n\nI am sure you will understand my reasons for asking these things.",
    "Indeed Mr Rafiel himself may have expected me to do so.",
    "III\n\nMr Broadribb showed this to Mr Schuster who leaned back in his chair\nand whistled.",
    "Shes going to take it on is she Sporting old bean he said.",
    "Then he\nadded I suppose she knows something of what its all about does\nshe\n\nApparently not said Mr Broadribb.",
    "I wish we did said Mr Schuster.",
    "He was an odd cuss.",
    "A difficult man said Mr Broadribb.",
    "I havent got the least idea said Mr Schuster have you\n\nNo I havent said Mr Broadribb.",
    "He added He didnt want me to\nhave I suppose.",
    "Well hes made things a lot more difficult by doing that.",
    "I dont see the\nleast chance that some old pussy from the country can interpret a\ndead mans brain and know what fantasy was plaguing him.",
    "You dont\nthink he was leading her up the garden path Having her on Sort of\njoke you know.",
    "Perhaps he thinks that she thinks shes the cats\nwhiskers at solving village problems but hes going to teach her a\nsharp lesson \n\nNo said Mr Broadribb I dont quite think that.",
    "Rafiel wasnt that\ntype of man.",
    "He was a mischievous devil sometimes said Mr Schuster.",
    "Yes but no I think he was serious over this.",
    "Something was worrying\nhim.",
    "In fact Im quite sure something was worrying him.",
    "And he didnt tell you what it was or give you the least idea\n\nNo he didnt.",
    "Then how the devil can he expect  Schuster broke off.",
    "He cant really have expected anything to come of this said Mr\nBroadribb.",
    "I mean how is she going to set about it\n\nA practical joke if you ask me.",
    "Twenty thousand pounds is a lot of money.",
    "Yes but if he knows she cant do it\n\nNo said Mr Broadribb.",
    "He wouldnt have been as unsporting as all\nthat.",
    "He must think shes got a chance of doing or finding out whatever\nit is.",
    "And what do we do\n\nWait said Mr Broadribb.",
    "Wait and see what happens next.",
    "After all\nthere has to be some development.",
    "Got some sealed orders somewhere have you\n\nMy dear Schuster said Mr Broadribb.",
    "Mr Rafiel had implicit trust in\nmy discretion and in my ethical conduct as a lawyer.",
    "Those sealed\n\n\finstructions are to be opened only under certain circumstances none\nof which has yet arisen.",
    "And never will said Mr Schuster.",
    "That ended the subject.",
    "IV\n\nMr Broadribb and Mr Schuster were lucky in so much as they had a full\nprofessional life to lead.",
    "Miss Marple was not so fortunate.",
    "She knitted\nand she reflected and she also went out for walks occasionally\nremonstrated with by Cherry for so doing.",
    "You know what the doctor said.",
    "You werent to take too much\nexercise.",
    "I walk very slowly said Miss Marple and I am not doing anything.",

    "Shes thinking out something said Cherry.",
    "Sort of plan.",
    "Thinking\nout how to tackle something thats how I look at it.",
    "She broke off the conversation at this stage and took in the coffee tray\nand put it down by Miss Marples side.",
    "Do you know a woman who lives in a new house somewhere here\nshes called Mrs Hastings asked Miss Marple.",
    "And someone called\nMiss Bartlett I think it is who lives with her \n\nWhat do you mean the house thats been all done up and repainted at\nthe end of the village The people there havent been there very long.",
    "I\n\n\fdont know what their names are.",
    "Why do you want to know Theyre\nnot very interesting.",
    "At least I shouldnt say they were.",
    "Are they related asked Miss Marple.",
    "No.",
    "Just friends I think.",
    "I wonder why  said Miss Marple and broke off.",

    "I hope the dear Canon is well and did not\nsuffer much with his asthma in the cold weather last winter.",
    "I am writing to ask you if you can possibly let me have the address of\nMrs Walters  Esther Walters  whom you may remember from the\nCaribbean days.",
    "She was secretary to Mr Rafiel.",
    "She did give me her\naddress at the time but unfortunately I have mislaid it.",
    "I was anxious to\nwrite to her as I have some horticultural information which she asked\nme about but which I was not able to tell her at the time.",
    "I heard in a\nroundabout way the other day that she had married again but I dont\nthink my informant was very certain of these facts.",
    "Perhaps you know\nmore about her than I do.",
    "I hope this is not troubling you too much.",
    "With kind regards to your\nbrother and best wishes to yourself.",
    "Yours sincerely\n\nJane Marple.",

    "No.",
    "Not so far away.",
    "I could.",
    "I dont know what\nwould be the best method possibly one of Inchs taxis.",
    "Slightly\nextravagant but if anything results from it it could be charged as\nexpenses quite legitimately.",
    "Now do I write to her beforehand or do I\n\n\fleave it to chance I think it would be better really to leave it to\nchance.",
    "Poor Esther.",
    "She could hardly remember me with any\naffection or kindliness.",
    "Miss Marple lost herself in a train of thought that arose from her\nthoughts.",
    "It was quite possible that her actions in the Caribbean had\nsaved Esther Walters from being murdered in the not far distant\nfuture.",
    "At any rate that was Miss Marples belief but probably Esther\nWalters had not believed any such thing.",
    "A nice woman said Miss Marple uttering the words in a soft tone\naloud a very nice woman.",
    "The kind that would so easily marry a bad\nlot.",
    "In fact the sort of woman that would marry a murderer if she were\never given half a chance.",
    "I still consider continued Miss Marple\nthoughtfully sinking her voice still lower that I probably saved her\nlife.",
    "In fact I am almost sure of it but I dont think she would agree with\nthat point of view.",
    "She probably dislikes me very much.",
    "Which makes it\nmore difficult to use her as a source of information.",
    "Still one can but\ntry.",
    "Its better than sitting here waiting waiting waiting.",
    "Was Mr Rafiel perhaps making fun of her when he had written that\nletter He was not always a particularly kindly man  he could be very\ncareless of peoples feelings.",

    "Just talking.",
    "Then when I looked I saw it wasnt that\nperson at all I was talking to.",
    "It was somebody else.",
    "Very odd.",
    "Bit of a mix up said Cherry helpfully.",

    "You said Miss\nMarple are Mr Broadribbs secretary.",

    "When she tells you make a note of it and ring off.",

    "Jane Marple.",
    "We met in the hotel in\nSt Honor\u00e9 oh  quite a long time ago.",
    "A year and a half.",
    "Miss Marple So it is of course.",
    "Fancy seeing you\n\n\fHow very nice to see you.",
    "I am lunching with some friends near here\nbut I have to pass back through Alton later.",

    "Or at any\nrate when she was seeming to be slightly flustered.",
    "In this case it was\nmisleading since things had happened exactly as she had hoped they\nwould happen.",
    "Its so nice to see you she said to Esther.",
    "So very nice to see you\nagain.",
    "You know I do think things are so very odd in this world.",
    "You\nhope youll meet people again and youre quite sure you will.",
    "And then\ntime passes and suddenly its all such a surprise.",
    "And then said Esther one says its a small world doesnt one\n\n\fYes indeed and I think there is something in that.",
    "I mean it does\nseem a very large world and the West Indies are such a very long way\naway from England.",
    "Well I mean of course I might have met you\nanywhere.",
    "In London or at Harrods.",
    "On a railway station or in a bus.",
    "There are so many possibilities.",
    "Yes there are a lot of possibilities said Esther.",
    "I certainly shouldnt\nhave expected to meet you just here because this isnt really quite your\npart of the world is it\n\nNo.",
    "No it isnt.",
    "Not that youre really so very far from St Mary Mead\nwhere I live.",
    "Actually I think its only about twentyfive miles.",
    "But\ntwentyfive miles in the country when one hasnt got a car and of\ncourse I couldnt afford a car and anyway I mean I cant drive a car\nso it wouldnt be much to the point so one really does see ones\nneighbours on the bus route or else go by a taxi from the village.",
    "Youre looking wonderfully well said Esther.",
    "I was just going to say you were looking wonderfully well my dear.",
    "I\nhad no idea you lived in this part of the world.",
    "I have only done so for a short time.",
    "Since my marriage actually.",
    "Oh I didnt know.",
    "How interesting.",
    "I suppose I must have missed it.",
    "I\nalways do look down the marriages.",
    "Ive been married four or five months said Esther.",
    "My name is\nAnderson now.",
    "Mrs Anderson said Miss Marple.",
    "Yes.",
    "I must try and remember that.",
    "And your husband\n\nIt would be unnatural she thought if she did not ask about the\nhusband.",
    "Old maids were notoriously inquisitive.",
    "He is an engineer said Esther.",
    "He runs the Time and Motion\nBranch.",
    "He is she hesitated.",
    "a little younger than I am.",
    "Much better said Miss Marple immediately.",
    "Oh much better my\ndear.",
    "In these days men age so much quicker than women.",
    "I know it\nused not to be said so but actually its true.",
    "I mean they get more\nthings the matter with them.",
    "I think perhaps they worry and work too\nmuch.",
    "And then they get high blood pressure or low blood pressure or\nsometimes a little heart trouble.",
    "Theyre rather prone to gastric ulcers\ntoo.",
    "I dont think we worry so much you know I think were a tougher\nsex.",
    "Perhaps we are said Esther.",
    "She smiled now at Miss Marple and Miss Marple felt reassured.",
    "The\nlast time she had seen Esther Esther had looked as though she hated\nher and probably she had hated her at that moment.",
    "But now well\nnow perhaps she might even feel slightly grateful.",
    "She might have\nrealised that she herself might even have been under a stone slab in\na respectable churchyard instead of living a presumably happy life\nwith Mr Anderson.",
    "You look very well she said and very gay.",
    "So do you Miss Marple.",
    "Well of course I am rather older now.",
    "And one has so many ailments.",
    "I mean not desperate ones nothing of that kind but I mean one has\nalways some kind of rheumatism or some kind of ache and pain\nsomewhere.",
    "Ones feet are not what one would like feet to be.",
    "And\ntheres usually ones back or a shoulder or painful hands.",
    "Oh dear\none shouldnt talk about these things.",
    "What a very nice house you\nhave.",
    "Yes we havent been in it very long.",
    "We moved in about four months\nago.",
    "Miss Marple looked round.",
    "She had rather thought that that was the\ncase.",
    "She thought too that when they had moved in they had moved\nin on quite a handsome scale.",
    "The furniture was expensive it was\ncomfortable comfortable and just this side of luxury.",
    "Good curtains\ngood covers no particular artistic taste displayed but then she would\nnot have expected that.",
    "She thought she knew the reason for this\nappearance of prosperity.",
    "She thought it had come about on the\nstrength of the late Mr Rafiels handsome legacy to Esther.",
    "She was\nglad to think that Mr Rafiel had not changed his mind.",
    "I expect you saw the notice of Mr Rafiels death said Esther\nspeaking almost as if she knew what was in Miss Marples mind.",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes indeed I did.",
    "It was about a month ago now wasnt it I was\nso sorry.",
    "Very distressed really although well I suppose one knew\nhe almost admitted it himself didnt he He hinted several times that it\n\n\fwouldnt be very long.",
    "I think he was quite a brave man about it all\ndont you\n\nYes he was a very brave man and a very kind one really said\nEsther.",
    "He told me you know when I first worked for him that he was\ngoing to give me a very good salary but that I would have to save out of\nit because I neednt expect to have anything more from him.",
    "Well I\ncertainly didnt expect to have anything more from him.",
    "He was very\nmuch a man of his word wasnt he But apparently he changed his\nmind.",
    "Yes said Miss Marple.",
    "Yes.",
    "I am very glad of that.",
    "I thought\nperhaps not that he of course said anything but I wondered.",
    "He left me a very big legacy said Esther.",
    "A surprisingly large sum\nof money.",
    "It came as a very great surprise.",
    "I could hardly believe it at\nfirst.",
    "I think he wanted it to be a surprise to you.",
    "I think he was perhaps that\nkind of man said Miss Marple.",
    "She added\n\nDid he leave anything to oh what was his name the man attendant\nthe nurseattendant\n\nOh you mean Jackson No he didnt leave anything to Jackson but I\nbelieve he made him some handsome presents in the last year.",
    "Have you ever seen anything more of Jackson\n\n\fNo.",
    "No I dont think Ive met him once since the time out in the\nislands.",
    "He didnt stay with Mr Rafiel after they got back to England.",
    "I\nthink he went to Lord somebody who lives in Jersey or Guernsey.",
    "I would like to have seen Mr Rafiel again said Miss Marple.",
    "It seems\nodd after wed all been mixed up so.",
    "He and you and I and some others.",
    "And then later when Id come home when six months had passed  it\noccurred to me one day how closely associated we had been in our\ntime of stress and yet how little I really knew about Mr Rafiel.",
    "I was\nthinking it only the other day after Id seen the notice of his death.",
    "I\nwished I could know a little more.",
    "Where he was born you know and\nhis parents.",
    "What they were like.",
    "Whether he had any children or\nnephews or cousins or any family.",
    "I would so like to know.",
    "Esther Anderson smiled slightly.",
    "She looked at Miss Marple and her\nexpression seemed to say Yes Im sure you always want to know\neverything of that kind about everyone you meet.",
    "But she merely said\n\nNo there was really only one thing that everyone did know about\nhim.",
    "That he was very rich said Miss Marple immediately.",
    "Thats what\nyou mean isnt it When you know that someone is very rich\nsomehow well you dont ask any more.",
    "I mean you dont ask to know\nany more.",
    "You say He is very rich or you say He is enormously rich\nand your voice just goes down a little because its so impressive isnt\nit when you meet someone who is immensely rich.",
    "Esther laughed slightly.",
    "He wasnt married was he asked Miss Marple.",
    "He never\nmentioned a wife.",
    "He lost his wife many years ago.",
    "Quite soon after they were married I\nbelieve.",
    "I believe she was much younger than he was  I think she died\nof cancer.",
    "Very sad.",
    "Had he children\n\nOh yes two daughters and a son.",
    "One daughter is married and lives\nin America.",
    "The other daughter died young I believe.",
    "I met the\nAmerican one once.",
    "She wasnt at all like her father.",
    "Rather a quiet\ndepressedlooking young woman.",
    "She added Mr Rafiel never spoke about the son.",
    "I rather think that\nthere had been trouble there.",
    "A scandal or something of that kind.",
    "I\nbelieve he died some years ago.",
    "Anyway his father never mentioned\nhim.",
    "Oh dear.",
    "That was very sad.",
    "I think it happened quite a long time ago.",
    "I believe he took off for\nsomewhere or other abroad and never came back  died out there\nwherever it was.",
    "Was Mr Rafiel very upset about it\n\nOne wouldnt know with him said Esther.",
    "He was the kind of man\nwho would always decide to cut his losses.",
    "If his son turned out to be\nunsatisfactory a burden instead of a blessing I think he would just\n\n\fshrug the whole thing off.",
    "Do what was necessary perhaps in the way\nof sending him money for support but never thinking of him again.",
    "One wonders said Miss Marple.",
    "He never spoke of him or said\nanything\n\nIf you remember he was a man who never said anything much about\npersonal feelings or his own life.",
    "No.",
    "No of course not.",
    "But I thought perhaps you having been well\nhis secretary for so many years that he might have confided any\ntroubles to you.",
    "He was not a man for confiding troubles said Esther.",
    "If he had any\nwhich I rather doubt.",
    "He was wedded to his business one might say.",
    "He was father to his business and his business was the only kind of son\nor daughter that he had that mattered I think.",
    "He enjoyed it all\ninvestment making money.",
    "Business coups...",
    "Call no man happy until he is dead murmured Miss Marple\nrepeating the words in the manner of one pronouncing them as a kind\nof slogan which indeed they appeared to be in these days or so she\nwould have said.",
    "So there was nothing especially worrying him was there before his\ndeath\n\nNo.",
    "Why should you think so Esther sounded surprised.",
    "Well I didnt actually think so said Miss Marple I just wondered\nbecause things do worry people more when they are  I wont say\ngetting old because he really wasnt old but I mean things worry you\nmore when you are laid up and cant do as much as you did and have to\ntake things easy.",
    "Then worries just come into your mind and make\nthemselves felt.",
    "Yes I know what you mean said Esther.",
    "But I dont think Mr Rafiel\nwas like that.",
    "Anyway she added I ceased being his secretary some\ntime ago.",
    "Two or three months after I met Edmund.",
    "Ah yes.",
    "Your husband.",
    "Mr Rafiel must have been very upset at losing\nyou.",
    "Oh I dont think so said Esther lightly.",
    "He was not one who would be\nupset over that sort of thing.",
    "Hed immediately get another secretary\nwhich he did.",
    "And then if she didnt suit him hed get rid of her with a\nkindly golden handshake and get somebody else till he found\nsomebody who suited him.",
    "He was an intensely sensible man always.",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes I can see that.",
    "Though he could lose his temper very easily.",
    "Oh he enjoyed losing his temper said Esther.",
    "It made a bit of\ndrama for him I think.",
    "Drama said Miss Marple thoughtfully.",
    "Do you think  I have often\nwondered  do you think that Mr Rafiel had any particular interest in\ncriminology the study of it I mean He well I dont know...\n\n\fYou mean because of what happened in the Caribbean Esthers\nvoice had gone suddenly hard.",
    "Miss Marple felt doubtful of going on and yet she must somehow or\nother try and get a little helpful knowledge.",
    "Well no not because of that but afterwards perhaps he wondered\nabout the psychology of these things.",
    "Or he got interested in the cases\nwhere justice had not been administered properly or  oh well...\n\nShe sounded more scatty every minute.",
    "Why should he take the least interest in anything of that kind And\ndont lets talk about that horrible business in St Honor\u00e9.",
    "Oh no I think you are quite right.",
    "Im sure Im very sorry.",
    "I was just\nthinking of some of the things that Mr Rafiel sometimes said.",
    "Queer\nturns of phrase sometimes and I just wondered if he had any theories\nyou know... about the causes of crime\n\nHis interests were always entirely financial said Esther shortly.",
    "A\nreally clever swindle of a criminal kind might have interested him\nnothing else.",
    "She was looking coldly still at Miss Marple.",
    "I am sorry said Miss Marple apologetically.",
    "I  I shouldnt have\ntalked about distressing matters that are fortunately past.",
    "And I must\nbe getting on my way she added.",
    "I have got my train to catch and I\n\n\fshall only just have time.",
    "Oh dear what did I do with my bag  oh yes\nhere it is.",
    "She collected her bag umbrella and a few other things fussing away\nuntil the tension had slightly abated.",
    "As she went out of the door she\nturned to Esther who was urging her to stay and have a cup of tea.",
    "No thank you my dear.",
    "Im so short of time.",
    "Im very pleased to have\nseen you again and I do offer my best congratulations and hopes for a\nvery happy life.",
    "I dont suppose you will be taking up any post again\nnow will you\n\nOh some people do.",
    "They find it interesting they say.",
    "They get bored\nwhen they have nothing to do.",
    "But I think I shall rather enjoy living a life\nof leisure.",
    "I shall enjoy my legacy too that Mr Rafiel left me.",
    "It was\nvery kind of him and I think hed want me  well to enjoy it even if I\nspent it in what hed think of perhaps as a rather silly female way\nExpensive clothes and a new hairdo and all that.",
    "Hed have thought\nthat sort of thing very silly.",
    "She added suddenly I was fond of him\nyou know.",
    "Yes I was quite fond of him.",
    "I think it was because he was a\nsort of challenge to me.",
    "He was difficult to get on with and therefore I\nenjoyed managing it.",
    "And managing him\n\nWell not quite managing him but perhaps a little more than he knew I\nwas.",
    "Miss Marple trotted away down the road.",
    "She looked back once and waved her hand.",
    "Esther Anderson was still\nstanding on the doorstep and she waved back cheerfully.",
    "I thought this might have been something to do with her or something\nshe knew about said Miss Marple to herself.",
    "I think Im wrong.",
    "No I\ndont think shes concerned in this business whatever it is in any way.",
    "Oh dear I feel Mr Rafiel expected me to be much cleverer than I am\nbeing.",
    "I think he expected me to put things together but what things\nAnd what do I do next I wonder She shook her head.",
    "She had to think over things very carefully.",
    "This business had been as\nit were left to her.",
    "Left to her to refuse to accept to understand what\nit was all about Or not to understand anything but to go forward and\nhope that some kind of guidance might be given to her.",
    "Occasionally\nshe closed her eyes and tried to picture Mr Rafiels face.",
    "Sitting in the\ngarden of the hotel in the West Indies in his tropical suit his badtempered corrugated face his flashes of occasional humour.",
    "What she\nreally wanted to know was what had been in his mind when he worked\nup this scheme when he set out to bring it about.",
    "To lure her into\naccepting it to persuade her to accept it to  well perhaps one should\nsay to bully her into accepting it.",
    "The third was much the most likely\nknowing Mr Rafiel.",
    "And yet take it that he had wanted something done\nand he had chosen her settled upon her to do it.",
    "Why Because she\nhad suddenly come into his mind But why should she have come into\nhis mind\n\nShe thought back to Mr Rafiel and the things that had occurred at St\nHonor\u00e9.",
    "Had perhaps the problem he had been considering at the time\nof his death sent his mind back to that visit to the West Indies Was it in\nsome way connected with someone who had been out there who had\n\n\ftaken part or been an onlooker there and was that what had put Miss\nMarple into his mind Was there some link or some connection If not\nwhy should he suddenly think of her What was it about her that could\nmake her useful to him in any way at all.",
    "She was an elderly rather\nscatty quite ordinary person physically not very strong mentally not\nnearly as alert as she used to be.",
    "What had been her special\nqualifications if any She couldnt think of any.",
    "Could it possibly have\nbeen a bit of fun on Mr Rafiels part Even if Mr Rafiel had been on the\npoint of death he might have wanted to have some kind of joke that\nsuited his peculiar sense of humour.",
    "She could not deny that Mr Rafiel could quite possibly wish to have a\njoke even on his deathbed.",
    "Some ironical humour of his might be\nsatisfied.",
    "I must said Miss Marple to herself firmly I must have some\nqualification for something.",
    "After all since Mr Rafiel was no longer in\nthis world he could not enjoy his joke at first hand.",
    "What qualifications\nhad she got What qualities have I got that could be useful to anyone\nfor anything said Miss Marple.",
    "She considered herself with proper humility.",
    "She was inquisitive she\nasked questions she was the sort of age and type that could be\nexpected to ask questions.",
    "That was one point a possible point.",
    "You\ncould send a private detective round to ask questions or some\npsychological investigator but it was true that you could much more\neasily send an elderly lady with a habit of snooping and being\ninquisitive of talking too much of wanting to find out about things and\nit would seem perfectly natural.",
    "An old pussy said Miss Marple to herself.",
    "Yes I can see Im quite\nrecognisable as an old pussy.",
    "There are so many old pussies and\ntheyre all so much alike.",
    "And of course yes Im very ordinary.",
    "An\nordinary rather scatty old lady.",
    "And that of course as very good\ncamouflage.",
    "Dear me I wonder if Im thinking on the right lines.",
    "I do\nsometimes know what people are like.",
    "I mean I know what people are\nlike because they remind me of certain other people I have known.",
    "So\nI know some of their faults and some of their virtues.",
    "I know what kind\nof people they are.",
    "Theres that.",
    "She thought again of St Honor\u00e9 and the Hotel of the Golden Palm.",
    "She\nhad made one attempt to enquire into the possibilities of a link by her\nvisit to Esther Walters.",
    "That had been definitely nonproductive Miss\nMarple decided.",
    "There didnt seem any further link leading from there.",
    "Nothing that would tie up with his request that Miss Marple should\nbusy herself with something the nature of which she still had no idea\n\nDear me said Miss Marple what a tiresome man you are Mr\nRafiel She said it aloud and there was definite reproach in her voice.",
    "Later however as she climbed into bed and applied her cosy hot\nwater bottle to the most painful portion of her rheumatic back she\nspoke again in what might be taken as a semiapology.",
    "Ive done the best I could she said.",
    "She spoke aloud with the air of\naddressing one who might easily be in the room.",
    "Its true he might be\nanywhere but even then there might be some telepathic or telephonic\ncommunication and if so she was going to speak definitely and to the\npoint.",
    "Ive done all I could.",
    "The best according to my limitations and I must\nnow leave it up to you.",
    "With that she settled herself more comfortably stretched out a hand\nswitched off the electric light and went to sleep.",
    "Chapter 5\n\nINSTRUCTIONS FROM BEYOND\n\nIt was some three or four days later that a communication arrived by\nthe second post.",
    "Miss Marple picked up the letter did what she usually\ndid to letters turned it over looked at the stamp looked at the\nhandwriting decided that it wasnt a bill and opened it.",
    "It was\ntypewritten.",
    "Dear Miss Marple\n\nBy the time you read this I shall be dead and also buried.",
    "Not\ncremated I am glad to think.",
    "It has always seemed to me unlikely that\none would manage to rise up from ones handsome bronze vase full of\nashes and haunt anyone if one wanted so to do Whereas the idea of\n\n\frising from ones grave and haunting anyone is quite possible.",
    "Shall I\nwant to do that Who knows.",
    "I might even want to communicate with\nyou.",
    "By now my solicitors will have communicated with you and will have\nput a certain proposition before you.",
    "I hope you will have accepted it.",
    "If\nyou have not accepted it dont feel in the least remorseful.",
    "It will be\nyour choice.",
    "This should reach you if my solicitors have done what they were told\nto do and if the posts have done the duty they are expected to\nperform on the 11th of the month.",
    "In two days from now you will\nreceive a communication from a travel bureau in London.",
    "I hope what\nit proposes will not be distasteful to you.",
    "I neednt say more.",
    "I want you\nto have an open mind.",
    "Take care of yourself.",
    "I think you will manage to\ndo that.",
    "You are a very shrewd person.",
    "The best of luck and may your\nguardian angel be at your side looking after you.",
    "You may need one.",
    "Your affectionate friend\n\nJ.B. Rafiel.",
    "Two days said Miss Marple.",
    "She found it difficult to pass the time.",
    "The Post Office did their duty and\nso did the Famous Houses and Gardens of Great Britain.",
    "Dear Miss Jane Marple\n\nObeying instructions given us by the late Mr Rafiel we send you\nparticulars of our Tour No.",
    "37 of the Famous Houses and Gardens of\nGreat Britain which starts from London on Thursday next the 17th.",
    "If it should be possible for you to come to our office in London our Mrs\nSandbourne who is to accompany the tour will be very glad to give\nyou all particulars and to answer all questions.",
    "Our tours last for a period of two to three weeks.",
    "This particular tour\nMr Rafiel thinks will be particularly acceptable to you as it will visit a\npart of England which as far as he knows you have not yet visited and\ntakes in some really very attractive scenery and gardens.",
    "He has\narranged for you to have the best accomodation and all the luxury\navailable that we can provide.",
    "Perhaps you will let us know which day would suit you to visit our\noffice in Berkeley Street\n\nMiss Marple folded up the letter put it in her bag noted the telephone\nnumber thought of a few friends whom she knew rang up two of them\none of whom had been for tours with the Famous Houses and Gardens\n\n\fand spoke highly of them the other one had not been personally on a\ntour but had friends who had travelled with this particular firm and\nwho said everything was very well done though rather expensive and\nnot too exhausting for the elderly.",
    "She then rang up the Berkeley\nStreet number and said she would call upon them on the following\nTuesday.",
    "The next day she spoke to Cherry on the subject.",
    "I may be going away Cherry she said.",
    "On a Tour.",
    "A Tour said Cherry.",
    "One of these travel tours You mean a\npackage tour abroad\n\nNot abroad.",
    "In this country said Miss Marple.",
    "Mainly visiting\nhistoric buildings and gardens.",
    "Do you think its all right to do that at your age These things can be\nvery tiring you know.",
    "You have to walk miles sometimes.",
    "My health is really very good said Miss Marple and I have always\nheard that in these tours they are careful to provide restful intervals\nfor such people who are not particularly strong.",
    "Well be careful of yourself thats all said Cherry.",
    "We dont want\nyou falling down with a heart attack even if you are looking at a\nparticularly sumptuous fountain or something.",
    "Youre a bit old you\nknow to do this sort of thing.",
    "Excuse me saying it it sounds rude but I\ndont like to think of you passing out because youve done too much or\nanything like that.",
    "I can take care of myself said Miss Marple with some dignity.",
    "All right but you just be careful said Cherry.",
    "Miss Marple packed a suitcase bag went to London booked a room at\na modest hotel inn Ah Bertrams Hotel she thought in her mind\nwhat a wonderful hotel that was Oh dear I must forget all those\nthings the St George is quite a pleasant place.",
    "At the appointed time\nshe was at Berkeley Street and was shown in to the office where a\npleasant woman of about thirtyfive rose to meet her explained that\nher name was Mrs Sandbourne and that she would be in personal\ncharge of this particular tour.",
    "Am I to understand said Miss Marple that this trip is in my case \nshe hesitated.",
    "Mrs Sandbourne sensing slight embarrassment said\n\nOh yes I ought to have explained perhaps better in the letter we sent\nyou.",
    "Mr Rafiel has paid all expenses.",
    "You do know that he is dead said Miss Marple.",
    "Oh yes but this was arranged before his death.",
    "He mentioned that he\nwas in ill health but wanted to provide a treat for a very old friend of his\nwho had not had the opportunity of travelling as much as she could\nhave wished.",
    "II\n\nTwo days later Miss Marple carrying her small overnight bag her\nnew and smart suitcase surrendered to the driver had boarded a most\ncomfortable and luxurious coach which was taking a northwesterly\nroute out of London she was studying the passenger list which was\nattached to the inside of a handsome brochure giving details of the\ndaily itinerary of the coach and various information as to hotels and\nmeals places to be seen and occasional alternatives on some days\nwhich although the fact was not stressed actually intimated that one\nchoice of itinerary was for the young and active and that the other\nchoice would be peculiarly suitable for the elderly those whose feet\nhurt them who suffered from arthritis or rheumatism and who would\nprefer to sit about and not walk long distances or up too many hills.",
    "It\nwas all very tactful and well arranged.",
    "Miss Marple read the passenger list and surveyed her fellow\npassengers.",
    "There was no difficulty about doing this because the\nother fellow passengers were doing much the same themselves.",
    "They\nwere surveying her amongst others but nobody as far as Miss Marple\ncould notice was taking any particular interest in her.",
    "Mrs RiseleyPorter\n\nMiss Joanna Crawford\n\n\fColonel and Mrs Walker\n\nMr and Mrs H. T. Butler\n\nMiss Elizabeth Temple\n\nProfessor Wanstead\n\nMr Richard Jameson\n\nMiss Lumley\n\nMiss Bentham\n\nMr Caspar\n\nMiss Cooke\n\nMiss Barrow\n\nMr Emlyn Price\n\nMiss Jane Marple\n\nThere were four elderly ladies.",
    "Miss Marple took note of them first so\nas it were to clear them out of the way.",
    "Two were travelling together.",
    "Miss Marple put them down as about seventy.",
    "They could roughly be\n\n\fconsidered as contemporaries of her own.",
    "One of them was very\ndefinitely the complaining type one who would want to have seats at\nthe front of the coach or else would make a point of having them at the\nback of the coach.",
    "Would wish to sit on the sunny side or could only\nbear to sit on the shady side.",
    "Who would want more fresh air or less\nfresh air.",
    "They had with them travelling rugs and knitted scarves and\nquite an assortment of guide books.",
    "They were slightly crippled and\noften in pain from feet or backs or knees but were nevertheless of\nthose whom age and ailments could not prevent from enjoying life\nwhile they still had it.",
    "Old pussies but definitely not stayathome old\npussies.",
    "Miss Marple made an entry in the little book she carried.",
    "Fifteen passengers not including herself or Mrs Sandbourne.",
    "And\nsince she had been sent on this coach tour one at least of those fifteen\npassengers must be of importance in some way.",
    "Either as a source of\ninformation or someone concerned with the law or a law case or it\nmight even be a murderer.",
    "A murderer who might have already killed\nor one who might be preparing to kill Anything was possible Miss\nMarple thought with Rafiel Anyway she must make notes of these\npeople.",
    "On the righthand page of her notebook she would note down who\nmight be worthy of attention from Mr Rafiels point of view and on the\nleft she would note down or cross off those who could only be of any\ninterest if they could produce some useful information for her.",
    "Information it might be that they did not even know they possessed.",
    "Or rather that even if they possessed it they did not know it could\npossibly be useful to her or to Mr Rafiel or to the law or to Justice with\na capital J.",
    "At the back of her little book she might this evening\nmake a note or two as to whether anyone had reminded her of\n\n\fcharacters she had known in the past at St Mary Mead and other\nplaces.",
    "Any similarities might make a useful pointer.",
    "It had done so on\nother occasions.",
    "The other two elderly ladies were apparently separate travellers.",
    "Both\nof them were about sixty.",
    "One was a well preserved welldressed\nwoman of obvious social importance in her own mind but probably in\nother peoples minds as well.",
    "Her voice was loud and dictatorial.",
    "She\nappeared to have in tow a niece a girl of about eighteen or nineteen\nwho addressed her as Aunt Geraldine.",
    "The niece Miss Marple noted\nwas obviously well accustomed to coping with Aunt Geraldines\nbossiness.",
    "She was a competent girl as well as being an attractive\none.",
    "Across the aisle from Miss Marple was a big man with square\nshoulders and a clumsylooking body looking as though he had been\ncarelessly assembled by an ambitious child out of chunky bricks.",
    "His\nface looked as though nature had planned it to be round but the face\nhad rebelled at this and decided to achieve a square effect by\ndeveloping a powerful jaw.",
    "He had a thick head of greyish hair and\nenormous bushy eyebrows which moved up and down to give point to\nwhat he was saying.",
    "His remarks seemed mainly to come out in a\nseries of barks as though he was a talkative sheepdog.",
    "He shared his\nseat with a tall dark foreigner who moved restlessly in his seat and\ngesticulated freely.",
    "He spoke a most peculiar English making\noccasional remarks in French and German.",
    "The bulky man seemed\nquite capable of meeting these onslaughts of foreign language and\nshifted obligingly to either French or German.",
    "Taking a quick glance at\nthem again Miss Marple decided that the bushy eyebrows must be\nProfessor Wanstead and the excitable foreigner was Mr Caspar.",
    "She wondered what it was they were discussing with such animation\nbut was baffled by the rapidity of Mr Caspars delivery.",
    "The seat in front of them was occupied by the other woman of about\nsixty a tall woman possibly over sixty but a woman who would have\nstood out in a crowd anywhere.",
    "She was still a very handsome woman\nwith dark grey hair coiled high on her head drawn back from a fine\nforehead.",
    "She had a low clear incisive voice.",
    "A personality Miss\nMarple thought.",
    "Someone Yes she was decidedly someone.",
    "Reminds me she thought to herself of Dame Emily Waldron.",
    "Dame Emily Waldron had been the Principal of an Oxford College and a\nnotable scientist and Miss Marple having once met her in her\nnephews company had never quite forgotten her.",
    "Miss Marple resumed her survey of the passengers.",
    "There were two\nmarried couples one American middleaged amiable a talkative wife\nand a placidly agreeing husband.",
    "They were obviously dedicated\ntravellers and sightseers.",
    "There was also an English middleaged\ncouple whom Miss Marple noted down without hesitation as a retired\nmilitary man and wife.",
    "She ticked them off from the list as Colonel and\nMrs Walker.",
    "In the seat behind her was a tall thin man of about thirty with a highly\ntechnical vocabulary clearly an architect.",
    "There were also two\nmiddleaged ladies travelling together rather further up the coach.",
    "They were discussing the brochure and deciding what the tour was\ngoing to hold for them in the way of attractions.",
    "One was dark and thin\n\n\fand the other was fair and sturdily built and the latters face seemed\nfaintly familiar to Miss Marple.",
    "She wondered where she had seen or\nmet her before.",
    "However she could not recall the occasion to mind.",
    "Possibly someone she had met at a cocktail party or sat opposite to in\na train.",
    "There was nothing very special about her to remember.",
    "Only one more passenger remained for her to appraise and this was a\nyoung man possibly of about nineteen or twenty.",
    "He wore the\nappropriate clothes for his age and sex tight black jeans a polo\nnecked purple sweater and his head was an outsize rich mop of nondisciplined black hair.",
    "He was looking with an air of interest at the\nbossy womans niece and the bossy womans niece also Miss Marple\nthought was looking with some interest at him.",
    "In spite of the\npreponderance of elderly pussies and middleaged females there\nwere at any rate two young people among the passengers.",
    "They stopped for lunch at a pleasant riverside hotel and the afternoon\nsightseeing was given over to Blenheim.",
    "Miss Marple had already\nvisited Blenheim twice before so she saved her feet by limiting the\namount of sightseeing indoors and coming fairly soon to the\nenjoyment of the gardens and the beautiful view.",
    "By the time they arrived at the hotel where they were to stay the night\nthe passengers were getting to know each other.",
    "The efficient Mrs\nSandbourne still brisk and unwearied by her duties in directing the\nsightseeing did her part very well creating little groups by adding\nanyone who looked as if they were left out to one or other of them\nmurmuring.",
    "You must make Colonel Walker describe his garden to you.",
    "Such a\nwonderful collection of fuchsias he has.",
    "With such little sentences she drew people together.",
    "Miss Marple was now able to attach names to all the passengers.",
    "Bushy eyebrows turned out to be Professor Wanstead as she had\nthought and the foreigner was Mr Caspar.",
    "The bossy woman was Mrs\nRiseleyPorter and her niece was called Joanna Crawford.",
    "The young\nman with the hair was Emlyn Price and he and Joanna Crawford\nappeared to be finding out that certain things in life such as decided\nopinions they had in common on economics art general dislikes\npolitics and such topics.",
    "The two eldest pussies graduated naturally to Miss Marple as a\nkindred elderly pussy.",
    "They discussed happily arthritis rheumatism\ndiets\n\nnew\n\ndoctors\n\nremedies\n\nboth\n\nprofessional\n\npatent\n\nand\n\nreminiscences of old wives treatments which had had success where\nall else failed.",
    "They discussed the many tours they had been on to\nforeign places in Europe hotels travel agencies and finally the County\nof Somerset where Miss Lumley and Miss Bentham lived and where\nthe difficulties of getting suitable gardeners could hardly be believed.",
    "The two middleaged ladies travelling together turned out to be Miss\nCooke and Miss Barrow.",
    "Miss Marple still felt that one of these two the\nfair one Miss Cooke was faintly familiar to her but she still could not\nremember where she had seen her before.",
    "Probably it was only her\nfancy.",
    "It might also be just fancy but she could not help feeling that\nMiss Barrow and Miss Cooke appeared to be avoiding her.",
    "They\n\n\fseemed rather anxious to move away if she approached.",
    "That of\ncourse might be entirely her imagination.",
    "Fifteen people one of whom at least must matter in some way.",
    "In\ncasual conversation that evening she introduced the name of Mr.\nRafiel so as to note if anyone reacted in any way.",
    "Nobody did.",
    "The handsome woman was identified as Miss Elizabeth Temple who\nwas the retired Headmistress of a famous girls school.",
    "Nobody\nappeared to Miss Marple likely to be a murderer except possibly Mr\nCaspar and that was probably foreign prejudice.",
    "The thin young man\nwas Richard Jameson an architect.",
    "Perhaps I shall do better tomorrow said Miss Marple to herself.",
    "III\n\nMiss Marple went to bed definitely tired out.",
    "Sightseeing was pleasant\nbut exhausting and trying to study fifteen or sixteen people at once\nand wondering as you did so which of them could possibly be\nconnected with a murder was even more exhausting.",
    "It had a touch of\nsuch unreality about it that one could not Miss Marple felt take it\nseriously.",
    "These seemed to be all perfectly nice people the sort of\npeople who go on cruises and on tours and all the rest of it.",
    "However\nshe took another quick and cursory glance at the passenger list\nmaking a few little entries in her notebook.",
    "Mrs RiseleyPorter Not connected with crime.",
    "Too social and selfcentred.",
    "Niece Joanna Crawford The same But very efficient.",
    "Mrs RiseleyPorter however might have information of some kind\nwhich Miss Marple might find had a bearing on matters.",
    "She must keep\non agreeable terms with Mrs RiseleyPorter.",
    "Miss Elizabeth Temple A personality.",
    "Interesting.",
    "She did not remind\nMiss Marple of any murderer shed ever known.",
    "In fact said Miss Marple to herself she really radiates integrity.",
    "If\nshe had committed a murder it would be a very popular murder.",
    "Perhaps for some noble reason or for some reason that she thought\nnoble But that wasnt satisfactory either.",
    "Miss Temple she thought\nwould always know what she was doing and why she was doing it and\nwould not have any silly ideas about nobility when merely evil existed.",
    "All the same said Miss Marple shes someone and she might  she\njust might be a person Mr Rafiel wanted me to meet for some reason.",
    "She jotted down these thoughts on the right hand side of her notebook.",
    "She shifted her point of view.",
    "She had been considering a possible\nmurderer... hat about a prospective victim Who was a possible\nvictim No one very likely.",
    "Perhaps Mrs RiseleyPorter might qualify rich  rather disagreeable.",
    "The efficient niece might inherit.",
    "She and\nthe anarchistic Emlyn Price might combine in the cause of anti\n\n\fcapitalism.",
    "Not a very credible idea but no other feasible murder\nseemed to offer.",
    "Professor Wanstead An interesting man she was sure.",
    "Kindly too.",
    "Was he a scientist or was he medical She was not as yet sure but she\nput him down on the side of science.",
    "She herself knew nothing of\nscience but it seemed not at all unlikely.",
    "Mr and Mrs Butler She wrote them off.",
    "Nice Americans.",
    "No\nconnections with anyone in the West Indies or anyone she had known.",
    "No she didnt think that the Butlers could be relevant.",
    "Richard Jameson That was the thin architect.",
    "Miss Marple didnt see\nhow architecture could come into it though it might she supposed.",
    "A\npriests hole perhaps One of the houses they were going to visit\nmight have a priests hole which would contain a skeleton.",
    "And Mr\nJameson being an architect would know just where the priests hole\nwas.",
    "He might aid her to discover it or she might aid him to discover it\nand then they would find a body.",
    "Oh really said Miss Marple what\nnonsense I am talking and thinking.",
    "Miss Cooke and Miss Barrow A perfectly ordinary pair.",
    "And yet shed\ncertainly seen one of them before.",
    "At least shed seen Miss Cooke\nbefore.",
    "Oh well it would come to her she supposed.",
    "Colonel and Mrs Walker Nice people.",
    "Retired Army folk.",
    "Served\nabroad mostly.",
    "Nice to talk to but she didnt think thered be anything\nfor her there.",
    "Miss Bentham and Miss Lumley The elderly pussies.",
    "Unlikely to be\ncriminals but being elderly pussies they might know plenty of gossip\nor have some information or might make some illuminating remark\neven if it happened to come about in connection with rheumatism\narthritis or patent medicine.",
    "Mr Caspar Possibly a dangerous character.",
    "Very excitable.",
    "She\nwould keep him on the list for the present.",
    "Emlyn Price A student presumably.",
    "Students were very violent.",
    "Would\nMr Rafiel have sent her on the track of a student Well it would\ndepend perhaps on what the student had done or wished to do or was\ngoing to do.",
    "A dedicated anarchist perhaps.",
    "Oh dear said Miss Marple suddenly exhausted I must go to bed.",
    "Her feet ached her back ached and her mental reactions were not\nshe thought at their best.",
    "She slept at once.",
    "Her sleep was enlivened\nby several dreams.",
    "One where Professor Wansteads bushy eyebrows fell off because\nthey were not his own eyebrows but false ones.",
    "As she woke again\nher first impression was that which so often follows dreams a belief\nthat the dream in question had solved everything.",
    "Of course she thought of course His eyebrows were false and\nthat solved the whole thing.",
    "He was the criminal.",
    "Sadly it came to her that nothing was solved.",
    "Professor Wansteads\neyebrows coming off was of no help at all.",
    "Unfortunately now she was no longer sleepy.",
    "She sat up in bed with\nsome determination.",
    "She sighed and slipped on her dressinggown moved from her bed to\nan upright chair took a slightly larger notebook from her suitcase and\nstarted work.",
    "The project I have undertaken she wrote is connected certainly\nwith crime of some kind.",
    "Mr Rafiel has distinctly stated that in his\nletter.",
    "He said I had a flair for justice and that necessarily included a\nflair for crime.",
    "So crime is involved and it is presumably not espionage\nor fraud or robbery because such things have never come my way\nand I have no connection with such things or knowledge of them or\nspecial skills.",
    "What Mr Rafiel knows of me is only what he knew during\nthe period of time when we were both in St Honor\u00e9.",
    "We were\nconnected there with a murder.",
    "Murders as reported in the press have\nnever claimed my attention.",
    "I have never read books on criminology as\na subject or really been interested in such a thing.",
    "No it has just\nhappened that I have found myself in the vicinity of murder rather\nmore often than would seem normal.",
    "My attention has been directed to\nmurders\n\ninvolving\n\nfriends\n\nor\n\nacquaintances.",
    "These\n\ncurious\n\ncoincidences of connections with special subjects seem to happen to\npeople in life.",
    "One of my aunts I remember was on five occasions\nshipwrecked and a friend of mine was what I believe is officially called\naccidentprone.",
    "I know some of her friends refused to ride in a taxi\nwith her.",
    "She had been in four taxi accidents and three car accidents\nand two railway accidents.",
    "Things like this seem to happen to certain\npeople for no appreciable reason.",
    "I do not like to write it down but it\n\n\fdoes appear that murders seem to happen not to me myself thank\ngoodness but seem to happen in my vicinity.",
    "Miss Marple paused changed her position put a cushion in her back\nand continued\n\nI must try to make as logical a survey as I can of this project which I\nhave undertaken.",
    "My instructions or my briefing as naval friends of\nmine put it are so far quite inadequate.",
    "Practically nonexistent.",
    "So I\nmust ask myself one clear question.",
    "What is all this about Answer I\ndo not know.",
    "Curious and interesting.",
    "An odd way for a man like Mr\nRafiel to go about things especially when he was a successful\nbusiness and financial operator.",
    "He wants me to guess to employ my\ninstinct to observe and to obey such directions as are given to me or\nare hinted to me.",
    "So Point 1.",
    "Direction will be given me.",
    "Direction from a dead man.",
    "Point 2.",
    "What is involved in my problem is justice.",
    "Either to set right an\ninjustice or to avenge evil by bringing it to justice.",
    "This is in accord\nwith the code word Nemesis given to me by Mr Rafiel.",
    "After explanations of the principle involved I received my first factual\ndirective.",
    "It was arranged by Mr Rafiel before his death that I was to go\non Tour No.",
    "37 of the Famous Houses and Gardens.",
    "Why That is what\nI have to ask myself.",
    "Is it for some geographical or territorial reason\nA connection or a clue Some particular famous house Or something\ninvolving some particular garden or landscape connected This seems\nunlikely.",
    "The more likely explanation lies in the people or one of the\npeople on this particular coach party.",
    "None of them is known to me\npersonally but one of them at least must be connected with the riddle I\n\n\fhave to solve.",
    "Somebody among our group is connected or concerned\nwith a murder.",
    "Somebody has information or a special link with the\nvictim of a crime or someone personally is himself or herself a\nmurderer.",
    "A murderer as yet unsuspected.",
    "Miss Marple stopped here suddenly.",
    "She nodded her head.",
    "She was\nsatisfied now with her analysis so far as it went.",
    "And so to bed.",
    "Miss Marple added to her notebook.",
    "Here endeth the First Day.",
    "Chapter 6\n\nLOVE\n\nThe following morning they visited a small Queen Anne Manor House.",
    "The drive there had not been very long or tiring.",
    "It was a very\ncharminglooking house and had an interesting history as well as a\nvery beautiful and unusually laid out garden.",
    "Richard Jameson the architect was full of admiration for the\nstructural beauty of the house and being the kind of young man who is\nfond of hearing his own voice he slowed down in nearly every room\n\n\fthat they went through pointing out every special moulding or\nfireplace and giving historical dates and references.",
    "Some of the\ngroup appreciative at first began to get slightly restive as the\nsomewhat monotonous lecturing went on.",
    "Some of them began to\nedge carefully away and fall behind the party.",
    "The local caretaker who\nwas in charge was not himself too pleased at having his occupation\nusurped by one of the sightseers.",
    "He made a few efforts to get matters\nback into his own hands but Mr Jameson was unyielding.",
    "The\ncaretaker made a last try...",
    "In this room ladies and gentlemen the White Parlour folks call it is\nwhere they found a body.",
    "A young man it was stabbed with a dagger\nlying on the hearthrug.",
    "Way back in seventeen hundred and something\nit was.",
    "It was said that the Lady Moffat of that day had a lover.",
    "He came\nthrough a small side door and up a steep staircase to this room\nthrough a loose panel there was to the left of the fireplace.",
    "Sir Richard\nMoffat her husband you see was said to be across the seas in the\nLow Countries.",
    "But he came home and in he came unexpectedly and\ncaught em there together.",
    "He paused proudly.",
    "He was pleased at the response from his\naudience glad of a respite from the architectural details which they\nhad been having forced down their throats.",
    "Why isnt that just too romantic Henry said Mrs Butler in her\nresonant transatlantic tones.",
    "Why you know theres quite an\natmosphere in this room.",
    "I feel it.",
    "I certainly can feel it.",
    "Mamie is very sensitive to atmospheres said her husband proudly to\nthose around him.",
    "Why once when we were in an old house down in\nLouisiana...",
    "The narrative of Mamies special sensitivity got into its swing and Miss\nMarple and one or two others seized their opportunity to edge gently\nout of the room and down the exquisitely moulded staircase to the\nground floor.",
    "A friend of mine said Miss Marple to Miss Cooke and Miss Barrow\nwho were next to her had a most nerveracking experience only a\nfew years ago.",
    "A dead body on their library floor one morning.",

    "A blonde.",
    "But\nher hair was dyed.",
    "She was really a brunette and oh... Miss Marple\nbroke off her eyes fixed on Miss Cookes yellow hair where it escaped\nfrom her headscarf.",
    "It had come to her suddenly.",
    "She knew why Miss Cookes face was\nfamiliar and she knew where she had seen her before.",
    "But when she had seen her then Miss Cookes hair had been dark\nalmost black.",
    "And now it was bright yellow.",
    "Mrs RiseleyPorter coming down the stairs spoke decisively as she\npushed past them and completed the staircase and turned into the\nhall.",
    "I really cannot go up and down any more of those stairs she\ndeclared and standing around in these rooms is very tiring.",
    "I believe\nthe gardens here although not extensive are quite celebrated in\nhorticultural circles.",
    "I suggest we go there without loss of time.",
    "It looks\nas though it might cloud over before long.",
    "I think we shall get rain\nbefore morning is out.",
    "The authority with which Mrs RiseleyPorter could enforce her\nremarks had its usual result.",
    "All those near at hand or within hearing\nfollowed her obediently out through french doors in the diningroom\ninto the garden.",
    "The gardens had indeed all that Mrs RiseleyPorter\nhad claimed for them.",
    "She herself took possession firmly of Colonel\nWalker and set off briskly.",
    "Some of the others followed them others\ntook paths in the opposite direction.",
    "Miss Marple herself made a determined beeline for a garden seat\nwhich appeared to be of comfortable proportions as well as of artistic\nmerit.",
    "She sank down on it with relief and a sigh matching her own\nwas emitted by Miss Elizabeth Temple as she followed Miss Marple and\ncame to sit beside her on the seat.",
    "Going over houses is always tiring said Miss Temple.",
    "The most\ntiring thing in the world.",
    "Especially if you have to listen to an\nexhaustive lecture in each room.",
    "Of course all that we were told is very interesting said Miss Marple\nrather doubtfully.",
    "Oh do you think so said Miss Temple.",
    "Her head turned slightly and\nher eyes met those of Miss Marple.",
    "Something passed between the two\nwomen a kind of rapport  of understanding tinged with mirth.",
    "Dont you asked Miss Marple.",
    "No said Miss Temple.",
    "This time the understanding was definitely established between them.",
    "They sat there companionably in silence.",
    "Presently Elizabeth Temple\nbegan to talk about gardens and this garden in particular.",
    "It was designed by Holman she said somewhere about 1800 or\n1798.",
    "He died young.",
    "A pity.",
    "He had great genius.",
    "It is so sad when anyone dies young said Miss Marple.",
    "I wonder said Elizabeth Temple.",
    "She said it in a curious meditative\nway.",
    "But they miss so much said Miss Marple.",
    "So many things.",
    "Or escape so much said Miss Temple.",
    "Being as old as I am now said Miss Marple I suppose I cant help\nfeeling that early death means missing things.",
    "And I said Elizabeth Temple having spent nearly all my life\namongst the young look at life as a period in time complete in itself.",
    "What did T. S. Eliot say The moment of the rose and the moment of the\nyew tree are of equal duration.",
    "Miss Marple said I see what you mean... A life of whatever length is a\ncomplete experience.",
    "But dont you  she hesitated ever feel that a\nlife could be incomplete because it has been cut unduly short\n\nYes that is so.",
    "Miss Marple said looking at the flowers near her How beautiful\npeonies are.",
    "That long border of them so proud and yet so beautifully\nfragile.",
    "Elizabeth Temple turned her head towards her.",
    "Did you come on this trip to see the houses or to see gardens she\nasked.",
    "I suppose really to see the houses said Miss Marple.",
    "I shall enjoy\nthe gardens most though but the houses they will be a new\nexperience for me.",
    "Their variety and their history and the beautiful old\nfurniture and the pictures.",
    "She added A kind friend gave me this trip as a gift.",
    "I am very grateful.",
    "I have not seen very many big and famous houses in my life.",
    "A kind thought said Miss Temple.",
    "Do you often go on these sightseeing tours asked Miss Marple.",
    "No.",
    "This is not for me exactly a sightseeing tour.",
    "Miss Marple looked at her with interest.",
    "She half opened her lips to speak but refrained from putting a\nquestion.",
    "Miss Temple smiled at her.",
    "You wonder why I am here what my motive is my reason.",
    "Well why\ndont you make a guess\n\nOh I wouldnt like to do that said Miss Marple.",
    "Yes do so.",
    "Elizabeth Temple was urgent.",
    "It would interest me.",
    "Yes\nreally interest me.",
    "Make a guess.",
    "Miss Marple was silent for quite a few moments.",
    "Her eyes looked at\nElizabeth Temple steadily ranging over her thoughtfully in her\nappraisement.",
    "She said\n\nThis is not from what I know about you or what I have been told about\nyou.",
    "I know that you are quite a famous person and that your school is\na very famous one.",
    "No.",
    "I am only making my guess from what you look\nlike.",
    "I should write you down as a pilgrim.",
    "You have the look of one who\nis on a pilgrimage.",
    "There was a silence and then Elizabeth said\n\nThat describes it very well.",
    "Yes.",
    "I am on a pilgrimage.",
    "Miss Marple said after a moment or two\n\n\fThe friend who sent me on this tour and paid all my expenses is now\ndead.",
    "He was a Mr Rafiel a very rich man.",
    "Did you by any chance know\nhim\n\nJason Rafiel I know him by name of course.",
    "I never knew him\npersonally or met him.",
    "He gave a large endowment once to an\neducational project in which I was interested.",
    "I was very grateful.",
    "As\nyou say he was a very wealthy man.",
    "I saw the notice of his death in the\npapers a few weeks ago.",
    "So he was an old friend of yours\n\nNo said Miss Marple.",
    "I had met him just over a year ago abroad.",
    "In\nthe West Indies.",
    "I never knew much about him.",
    "His life or his family or\nany personal friends that he had.",
    "He was a great financier but\notherwise or so people always said he was a man who was very\nreserved about himself.",
    "Did you know his family or anyone... Miss\nMarple paused.",
    "I often wondered but ones does not like to ask\nquestions and seem inquisitive.",
    "Elizabeth was silent for a minute then she said\n\nI knew a girl once... A girl who had been a pupil of mine at Fallowfield\nmy school.",
    "She was no actual relation to Mr Rafiel but she was at one\ntime engaged to marry Mr Rafiels son.",
    "But she didnt marry him Miss Marple asked.",
    "No.",
    "Why not\n\n\fMiss Temple said One might hope to say  like to say  because she\nhad too much sense.",
    "He was not the type of a young man one would\nwant anyone one was fond of to marry.",
    "She was a very lovely girl and a\nvery sweet girl.",
    "I dont know why she didnt marry him.",
    "Nobody has\never told me.",
    "She sighed and then said Anyway she died...\n\nWhy did she die said Miss Marple.",
    "Elizabeth Temple stared at the peonies for some minutes.",
    "When she\nspoke she uttered one word.",
    "It echoed like the tone of a deep bell so\nmuch so that it was startling.",
    "Love she said.",
    "Miss Marple queried the word sharply.",
    "Love\n\nOne of the most frightening words there is in the world said\nElizabeth Temple.",
    "Again her voice was bitter and tragic.",
    "Love...\n\nChapter 7\n\n\fAN INVITATION\n\nMiss Marple decided to miss out on the afternoons sightseeing.",
    "She\nadmitted to being somewhat tired and would perhaps give a miss to an\nancient church and its 14thcentury glass.",
    "She would rest for a while\nand join them at the tea room which had been pointed out to her in the\nmain street.",
    "Mrs Sandbourne agreed that she was being very sensible.",
    "Miss Marple resting on a comfortable bench outside the tea room\nreflected on what she planned to do next and whether it would be wise\nto do it or not.",
    "When the others joined her at teatime it was easy for her to attach\nherself unobtrusively to Miss Cooke and Miss Barrow and sit with them\nat a table for four.",
    "The fourth chair was occupied by Mr Caspar whom\nMiss Marple considered as not sufficiently conversant with the English\nlanguage to matter.",
    "Leaning across the table as she nibbled a slice of Swiss roll Miss\nMarple said to Miss Cooke.",
    "You know I am quite sure we have met before.",
    "I have been wondering\nand wondering about it.",
    "Im not as good as I was at remembering\nfaces but Im sure I have met you somewhere.",
    "Miss Cooke looked kindly but doubtful.",
    "Her eyes went to her friend\nMiss Barrow.",
    "So did Miss Marples.",
    "Miss Barrow showed no signs of\nhelping to probe the mystery.",
    "I dont know if youve ever stayed in my part of the world went on\nMiss Marple I live in St Mary Mead.",
    "Quite a small village you know.",
    "At\nleast not so small nowadays there is so much building going on\neverywhere.",
    "Not very far from Much Benham and only twelve miles\nfrom the coast at Loomouth.",
    "Oh said Miss Cooke let me see.",
    "Well I know Loomouth quite well\nand perhaps...",
    "Suddenly Miss Marple made a pleased exclamation.",
    "Why of course I was in my garden one day at St Mary Mead and you\nspoke to me as you were passing by on the foot path.",
    "You said you\nwere staying down there I remember with a friend \n\nOf course said Miss Cooke.",
    "How stupid of me.",
    "I do remember you\nnow.",
    "We spoke of how difficult it was nowadays to get anyone  to do\njob gardening I mean anyone who was any use.",
    "Yes.",
    "You were not living there I think You were staying with\nsomeone.",
    "Yes I was staying with... with... for a moment Miss Cooke hesitated\nwith the air of one who hardly knows or remembers a name.",
    "With a Mrs Sutherland was it suggested Miss Marple.",
    "No no it was... er... Mrs..\n\n\fHastings said Miss Barrow firmly as she took a piece of chocolate\ncake.",
    "Oh yes in one of the new houses said Miss Marple.",
    "Hastings said Mr Caspar unexpectedly.",
    "He beamed.",
    "I have been to Hastings  I have been to Eastbourne too.",
    "He beamed\nagain.",
    "Very nice by the sea.",
    "Such a coincidence said Miss Marple meeting again so soon  such\na small world isnt it\n\nOh well we are all so fond of gardens said Miss Cooke vaguely.",
    "Flowers very pretty said Mr Casper.",
    "I like very much.",
    "He beamed\nagain.",
    "So many rare and beautiful shrubs said Miss Cooke.",
    "Miss Marple went full speed ahead with a gardening conversation of\nsome technicality.",
    "Miss Cooke responded.",
    "Miss Barrow put in an\noccasional remark.",
    "Mr Caspar relapsed into smiling silence.",
    "Later as Miss Marple took her usual rest before dinner she conned\nover what she had collected.",
    "Miss Cooke had admitted being in St\nMary Mead.",
    "She had admitted walking past Miss Marples house.",
    "Had\nagreed it was quite a coincidence.",
    "Coincidence thought Miss Marple\n\n\fmeditatively turning the word over in her mouth rather as a child\nmight do to a certain lollipop to decide its flavour.",
    "Was it a\ncoincidence Or had she had some reason to come there Had she\nbeen sent there Sent there for what reason Was that a ridiculous\nthing to imagine\n\nAny coincidence said Miss Marple to herself is always worth\nnoticing.",
    "You can throw it away later if it is only a coincidence.",
    "Miss Cooke and Miss Barrow appeared to be a perfectly normal pair of\nfriends doing the kind of tour which according to them they did every\nyear.",
    "They had been on an Hellenic cruise last year and a tour of bulbs\nin Holland the year before and Northern Ireland the year before that.",
    "They seemed perfectly pleasant and ordinary people.",
    "But Miss Cooke\nshe thought had for a moment looked as though she were about to\ndisclaim her visit to St Mary Mead.",
    "She had looked at her friend Miss\nBarrow rather as though she were seeking instruction as to what to\nsay.",
    "Miss Barrow was presumably the senior partner...\n\nOf course really I may have been imagining all these things thought\nMiss Marple.",
    "They may have no significance whatever.",
    "The word danger came unexpectedly into her mind.",
    "Used by Mr Rafiel\nin his first letter  and there had been some reference to her needing a\nguardian angel in his second letter.",
    "Was she going into danger in this\nbusiness and why From whom\n\nSurely not from Miss Cooke and Miss Barrow.",
    "Such an ordinarylooking couple.",
    "All the same Miss Cooke had dyed her hair and altered\nher style of hairdressing.",
    "Disguised her appearance as much as she\n\n\fcould in fact.",
    "Which was odd to say the least of it She considered\nonce more her fellow travellers.",
    "Mr Caspar now it would have been much easier to imagine that he\nmight be dangerous.",
    "Did he understand more English than he\npretended to do She began to wonder about Mr Caspar.",
    "Miss Marple had never quite succeeded in abandoning her Victorian\nview of foreigners.",
    "One never knew with foreigners.",
    "Quite absurd of\ncourse to feel like that  she had many friends from various foreign\ncountries.",
    "All the same... Miss Cooke Miss Barrow Mr Caspar that\nyoung man with the wild hair  Emlyn Something a revolutionary a\npractising anarchist Mr and Mrs Butler such nice Americans  but\nperhaps...too good to be true\n\nReally said Miss Marple I must pull myself together.",
    "She turned her attention to the itinerary of their trip.",
    "Tomorrow she\nthought was going to be rather strenuous.",
    "A mornings sightseeing\ndrive starting rather early a long rather athletic walk on a coastal\npath in the afternoon.",
    "Certain interesting marine flowering plants It\nwould be tiring.",
    "A tactful suggestion was appended.",
    "Anyone who felt\nlike a rest could stay behind in their hotel the Golden Boar which had\na very pleasant garden or could do a short excursion which would only\ntake an hour to a beauty spot nearby.",
    "She thought perhaps that she\nwould do that.",
    "But though she did not know it then her plans were to be suddenly\naltered.",
    "As Miss Marple came down from her room in the Golden Boar the next\nday after washing her hands before luncheon a woman in a tweed\ncoat and skirt came forward rather nervously and spoke to her.",
    "Excuse me are you Miss Marple Miss Jane Marple\n\nYes that is my name said Miss Marple slightly surprised.",
    "My name is Mrs Glynne.",
    "Lavinia Glynne.",
    "I and my two sisters live near\nhere and well we heard you were coming you see \n\nYou heard I was coming said Miss Marple with some slight surprise.",
    "Yes.",
    "A very old friend of ours wrote to us  oh quite some time ago it\nmust have been three weeks ago but he asked us to make a note of\nthis date.",
    "The date of the Famous Houses and Gardens Tour.",
    "He said\nthat a great friend of his or a relation Im not quite sure which would\nbe on that tour.",
    "Miss Marple continued to look surprised.",
    "Im speaking of a Mr Rafiel said Mrs Glynne.",
    "Oh Mr Rafiel said Miss Marple.",
    "You  you know that \n\nThat he died Yes.",
    "So sad.",
    "Just after his letter came.",
    "I think it must\nhave been certainly very soon after he wrote to us.",
    "But we felt a\nspecial urgency to try to do what he had asked.",
    "He suggested you\n\n\fknow that perhaps you would like to come and stay with us for a\ncouple of nights.",
    "This part of the tour is rather strenuous.",
    "I mean its\nall right for the young people but it is very trying for anyone older.",
    "It\ninvolves several miles of walking and a certain amount of climbing up\ndifficult cliff paths and places.",
    "My sisters and I would be so very\npleased if you could come and stay in our house here.",
    "It is only ten\nminutes walk from the hotel and Im sure we could show you many\ninteresting things locally.",
    "Miss Marple hesitated a minute.",
    "She liked the look of Mrs Glynne\nplump goodnatured and friendly though a little shy.",
    "Besides  here\nagain must be Mr Rafiels instructions...the next step for her to take\nYes it must be so.",
    "She wondered why she felt nervous.",
    "Perhaps because she was now at\nhome with the people in the tour felt part of the group although as yet\nshe had only known them for three days.",
    "She turned to where Mrs Glynne was standing looking up at her\nanxiously.",
    "Thank you it is most kind of you.",
    "I shall be very pleased to come.",
    "Chapter 8\n\nTHE THREE SISTERS\n\n\fMiss Marple stood looking out of a window.",
    "Behind her on the bed\nwas her suitcase.",
    "She looked out over the garden with unseeing eyes.",
    "It was not often that she failed to see a garden she was looking at in\neither a mood of admiration or a mood of criticism.",
    "In this case it would\npresumably have been criticism.",
    "It was a neglected garden a garden\non which little money had been spent possibly for some years and on\nwhich very little work had been done.",
    "The house too had been\nneglected.",
    "It was well proportioned the furniture in it had been good\nfurniture once but had had little in late years of polishing or attention.",
    "It was not a house she thought that had been at any rate of late\nyears loved in any way.",
    "It lived up to its name The Old Manor House...\nA house built with grace and a certain amount of beauty lived in once\ncherished.",
    "The daughters and sons had married and left and now it\nwas lived in by Mrs Glynne who from a word she had let fall when she\nshowed Miss Marple up to the bedroom appointed to her had inherited\nit with her sisters from an uncle and had come here to live with her\nsisters after her husband had died.",
    "They had all grown older their\nincomes had dwindled labour had been more difficult to get.",
    "The other sisters presumably had remained unmarried one older\none younger than Mrs Glynne two Miss BradburyScotts.",
    "There was no sign of anything which belonged to a child in the house.",
    "No discarded ball no old perambulator no little chair or a table.",
    "This\nwas just a house with three sisters.",
    "Sounds very Russian murmured Miss Marple to herself.",
    "She did\nmean The Three Sisters didnt she Chekhov was it or Dostoievsky\nReally she couldnt remember.",
    "Three sisters.",
    "But these would\n\n\fcertainly not be the kind of three sisters who were yearning to go to\nMoscow.",
    "These three sisters were presumably she was almost sure\nthey were content to remain where they were.",
    "She had been\nintroduced to the other two who had come one out of the kitchen and\none down a flight of stairs to welcome her.",
    "Their manners were well\nbred and gracious.",
    "They were what Miss Marple would have called in\nher youth by the now obsolete term ladies  and what she once\nrecalled calling decayed ladies.",
    "Her father had said to her\n\nNo dear Jane not decayed.",
    "Distressed gentlewomen.",
    "Gentlewomen nowadays were not so liable to be distressed.",
    "They\nwere aided by Government or by Societies or by a rich relation.",
    "Or\nperhaps  by someone like Mr Rafiel.",
    "Because after all that was the\nwhole point the whole reason for her being here wasnt it Mr Rafiel\nhad arranged all this.",
    "He had taken Miss Marple thought a good deal\nof trouble about it.",
    "He had known presumably some four or five weeks\nbefore his death just when that death was likely to be give and take a\nlittle since doctors were usually moderately optimistic knowing from\nexperience that patients who ought to die within a certain period very\noften took an unexpected lease of life and lingered on still doomed\nbut obstinately declining to take the final step.",
    "On the other hand\nhospital nurses when in charge of patients had Miss Marple thought\nfrom her experience always expected the patients to be dead the next\nday and were much surprised when they were not.",
    "But in voicing their\ngloomy views to Doctor when he came they were apt to receive in\nreply as the doctor went out of the hall door a private aside of Linger\na few weeks yet I shouldnt wonder.",
    "Very nice of Doctor to be so\noptimistic Nurse would think but surely Doctor was wrong.",
    "Doctor\nvery often wasnt wrong.",
    "He knew that people who were in pain\n\n\fhelpless crippled even unhappy still liked living and wanting to live.",
    "They would take one of Doctors pills to help them pass the night but\nthey had no intention of taking a few more than necessary of Doctors\npills just in order to pass the threshold to a world that they did not as\nyet know anything about\n\nMr Rafiel.",
    "That was the person Miss Marple was thinking about as she\nlooked across the garden with unseeing eyes.",
    "Mr Rafiel She felt now\nthat she was getting a little closer to understanding the task laid upon\nher the project suggested to her.",
    "Mr Rafiel was a man who made\nplans.",
    "Made them in the same way that he planned financial deals and\ntakeovers.",
    "In the words of her servant Cherry he had had a problem.",
    "When Cherry had a problem she often came and consulted Miss\nMarple about it.",
    "This was a problem that Mr Rafiel could not deal with himself which\nmust have annoyed him very much Miss Marple thought because he\ncould usually deal with any problem himself and insisted on doing so.",
    "But he was bedridden and dying.",
    "He could arrange his financial affairs\ncommunicate with his lawyers with his employees and with such\nfriends and relations as he had but there was something or someone\nthat he had not arranged for.",
    "A problem he had not solved a problem\nhe still wanted to solve a project he still wanted to bring about.",
    "And\napparently it was not one that could be settled by financial aid by\nbusiness dealings by the services of a lawyer.",
    "So he thought of me said Miss Marple.",
    "It still surprised her very much.",
    "Very much indeed.",
    "However in the\nsense she was now thinking of it his letter had been quite explicit.",
    "He\n\n\fhad thought she had certain qualifications for doing something.",
    "It had\nto do she thought once again with something in the nature of crime or\naffected by crime.",
    "The only other thing he knew about Miss Marple was\nthat she was devoted to gardens.",
    "Well it could hardly be a gardening\nproblem that he wanted her to solve.",
    "But he might think of her in\nconnection with crime.",
    "Crime in the West Indies and crimes in her own\nneighbourhood at home.",
    "A crime where\n\nMr Rafiel had made arrangements.",
    "Arrangements to begin with with\nhis lawyers.",
    "They had done their part.",
    "At the right interval of time they\nhad forwarded to her his letter.",
    "It had been she thought a well\nconsidered and well thought out letter.",
    "It would have been simpler\ncertainly to tell her exactly what he wanted her to do and why he\nwanted it.",
    "She was surprised in a way that he had not before his\ndeath sent for her probably in a somewhat peremptory way and more\nor less lying on what he would have assured her was his deathbed and\nwould then have bullied her until she consented to do what he was\nasking her.",
    "But no that would not really have been Mr Rafiels way\nshe thought.",
    "He could bully people none better but this was not a\ncase of bullying and he did not wish either she was sure to appeal to\nher to beg her to do him a favour to urge her to redress a wrong.",
    "No.",
    "That again would not have been Mr Rafiels way.",
    "He wanted she\nthought as he had probably wanted all his life to pay for what he\nrequired.",
    "He wanted to pay her and therefore he wanted to interest\nher enough to enjoy doing certain work.",
    "The pay was offered to\nintrigue her not really to tempt her.",
    "It was to arouse her interest.",
    "She\ndid not think that he had said to himself Offer enough money and\nshell leap at it because as she knew very well herself the money\n\n\fsounded very agreeable but she was not in urgent need of money.",
    "She\nhad her dear and affectionate nephew who if she was in straits for\nmoney of any kind if she needed repairs to her house or visit to a\nspecialist or special treats dear Raymond would always provide them.",
    "No.",
    "The sum he offered was to be exciting.",
    "It was to be exciting in the same way as it was exciting when you had a\nticket for the Irish Sweep.",
    "It was a fine big sum of money that you could\nnever achieve by any other means except luck.",
    "But all the same Miss Marple thought to herself she would need some\nluck as well as hard work she would require a lot of thought and\npondering and possibly what she was doing might involve a certain\namount of danger.",
    "But shed got to find out herself what it was all\nabout he wasnt going to tell her partly perhaps because he did not\nwant to influence her It is hard to tell anyone about something without\nletting slip your own point of view about it.",
    "It could be that Mr Rafiel\nhad thought that his own point of view might be wrong.",
    "It was not very\nlike him to think such a thing but it could be possible.",
    "He might\nsuspect that his judgement impaired by illness was not quite as good\nas it used to be.",
    "So she Miss Marple his agent his employee was to\nmake her own guesses come to her own conclusions.",
    "Well it was time she came to a few conclusions now.",
    "In other words\nback to the old question what was all this about\n\nShe had been directed.",
    "Let her take that first.",
    "She had been directed\nby a man who was now dead.",
    "She had been directed away from St\nMary Mead.",
    "Therefore the task whatever it must be could not be\n\n\fattacked from there.",
    "It was not a neighbourhood problem it was not a\nproblem that you could solve just by looking through newspaper\ncuttings or making enquiries not that is until you found what you had\nto make enquiries about.",
    "She had been directed first to the lawyers\noffice then to read a letter  two letters  in her home then to be sent\non a pleasant and well run tour round some of the Famous Houses and\nGardens of Great Britain.",
    "From that she had come to the next stepping stone.",
    "The house she was\nin at this moment.",
    "The Old Manor House Jocelyn St Mary where lived\nMiss Clotilde BradburyScott Mrs Glynne and Miss Anthea BradburyScott.",
    "Mr Rafiel had arranged that arranged it beforehand.",
    "Some\nweeks before he died.",
    "Probably it was the next thing he had done after\ninstructing his lawyers and after booking a seat on the tour in her\nname.",
    "Therefore she was in this house for a purpose.",
    "It might be for\nonly two nights it might be for longer.",
    "There might be certain things\narranged which would lead her to stay longer or she would be asked to\nstay longer.",
    "That brought her back to where she stood now.",
    "Mrs Glynne and her two sisters.",
    "They must be concerned implicated in\nwhatever this was.",
    "She would have to find out what it was.",
    "The time\nwas short.",
    "That was the only trouble.",
    "Miss Marple had no doubt for one\nmoment that she had the capacity to find out things.",
    "She was one of\nthose chatty fluffy old ladies whom other people expect to talk to ask\nquestions that were on the face of it merely gossipy questions.",
    "She would talk about her childhood and that would lead to one of the\nsisters talking about theirs.",
    "Shed talk about food she had eaten\nservants she had had daughters and cousins and relations travel\n\n\fmarriages births and yes deaths.",
    "There must be no show of special\ninterest in her eyes when she heard about a death.",
    "Not at all.",
    "Almost automatically she was sure she could come up with the right\nresponse such as Oh dear me how very sad She would have to find\nout relationships incidents life stories see if any suggestive incidents\nwould pop up so to speak.",
    "It might be some incidents in the\nneighbourhood not directly concerned with these three people.",
    "Something they could know about talk about or were pretty sure to\ntalk about.",
    "Anyway there would be something here some clue some\npointer.",
    "The second day from now she would rejoin the tour unless she\nhad by that time some indication that she was not to rejoin the tour.",
    "Her mind swept from the house to the coach and the people who had\nsat in it.",
    "It might be that what she was seeking had been there in the\ncoach and would be there again when she rejoined it.",
    "One person\nseveral people some innocent some not so innocent some long\npast story.",
    "She frowned a little trying to remember something.",
    "Something that had flashed in her mind that she had thought Really I\nam sure  of what had she been sure\n\nHer mind went back to the three sisters.",
    "She must not be too long up\nhere.",
    "She must unpack a few modest needs for two nights something\nto change into this evening night clothes sponge bag and then go\ndown and rejoin her hostesses and make pleasant talk.",
    "A main point\nhad to be decided.",
    "Were the three sisters to be her allies or were the\nthree sisters enemies They might fall into either category.",
    "She must\nthink about that carefully.",
    "There was a tap on the door and Mrs Glynne entered.",
    "I do hope you will be quite comfortable here.",
    "Can I help you to\nunpack We have a very nice woman who comes in but she is only\nhere in the morning.",
    "But shell help you with anything.",
    "Oh no thank you said Miss Marple.",
    "I only took out just a few\nnecessities.",
    "I thought Id show you the way downstairs again.",
    "Its rather a\nrambling house you know.",
    "There are two staircases and it does make\nit a little difficult.",
    "Sometimes people lose their way.",
    "Oh its very kind of you said Miss Marple.",
    "I hope then you will come downstairs and we will have a glass of\nsherry before lunch.",
    "Miss Marple accepted gratefully and followed her guide down the\nstairs.",
    "Mrs Glynne she judged was a good many years younger than\nshe herself was.",
    "Fifty perhaps.",
    "Not much more.",
    "Miss Marple\nnegotiated the stairs carefully her left knee was always a little\nuncertain.",
    "There was however a banister at one side of the stairs.",
    "Very beautiful stairs they were and she remarked on them.",
    "It is really a very lovely house she said.",
    "Built I suppose in the\n1700s.",
    "Am I right\n\n1780 said Mrs Glynne.",
    "She seemed pleased with Miss Marples appreciation.",
    "She took Miss\nMarple into the drawing room.",
    "A large graceful room.",
    "There were one\n\n\for two rather beautiful pieces of furniture.",
    "A Queen Anne desk and a\nWilliam and Mary oystershell bureau.",
    "There were also some rather\ncumbrous Victorian settees and cabinets.",
    "The curtains were of chintz\nfaded and somewhat worn the carpet was Miss Marple thought Irish.",
    "Possibly a Limerick Aubusson type.",
    "The sofa was ponderous and the\nvelvet of it much worn.",
    "The other two sisters were already sitting\nthere.",
    "They rose as Miss Marple came in and approached her one with\na glass of sherry the other directing her to a chair.",
    "I dont know whether you like sitting rather high So many people do.",
    "I do said Miss Marple.",
    "Its so much easier.",
    "Ones back you know.",
    "The sisters appeared to know about the difficulties of backs.",
    "The\neldest of the sisters was a tall handsome woman dark with a black coil\nof hair.",
    "The other one night have been a good deal younger.",
    "She was\nthin with grey hair that had once been fair hanging untidily on her\nshoulders and a faintly wraithlike appearance.",
    "She could be cast\nsuccessfully as a mature Ophelia Miss Marple thought.",
    "Clotilde Miss Marple thought was certainly no Ophelia but she would\nhave made a magnificent Clytemnestra she could have stabbed a\nhusband in his bath with exultation.",
    "But since she had never had a\nhusband that solution wouldnt do.",
    "Miss Marple could not see her\nmurdering anyone else but a husband and there had been no\nAgamemnon in this house.",
    "Clotilde BradburyScott Anthea BradburyScott Lavinia Glynne.",
    "Clotilde was handsome Lavinia was plain but pleasantlooking Anthea\nhad one eyelid which twitched from time to time.",
    "Her eyes were large\n\n\fand grey and she had an odd way of glancing round to right and then\nto left and then suddenly in a rather strange manner behind her over\nher shoulder.",
    "It was as though she felt someone was watching her all\nthe time.",
    "Odd thought Miss Marple.",
    "She wondered a little about\nAnthea.",
    "They sat down and conversation ensued.",
    "Mrs Glynne left the room\napparently for the kitchen.",
    "She was it seemed the active domestic\none of the three.",
    "The conversation took a usual course.",
    "Clotilde\nBradburyScott explained that the house was a family one.",
    "It had\nbelonged to her greatuncle and then to her uncle and when he had\ndied it was left to her and her two sisters who had joined her there.",
    "He only had one son you see explained Miss BradburyScott and\nhe was killed in the war.",
    "We are really the last of the family except for\nsome very distant cousins.",
    "A beautifully proportioned house said Miss Marple.",
    "Your sister tells\nme it was built about 1780.",
    "Yes I believe so.",
    "One could wish you know it was not quite so large\nand rambling.",
    "Repairs too said Miss Marple come very heavy nowadays.",
    "Oh yes indeed Clotilde sighed.",
    "And in many ways we have to let a\nlot of it just fall down.",
    "Sad but there it is.",
    "A lot of the outhouses for\ninstance and a greenhouse.",
    "We had a very beautiful big greenhouse.",
    "Lovely muscat grapevine in it said Anthea.",
    "And Cherry Pie used to\ngrow all along the walls inside.",
    "Yes I really regret that very much.",
    "Of\ncourse during the war one could not get any gardeners.",
    "We had a\nvery young gardener and then he was called up.",
    "One does not of\ncourse grudge that but all the same it was impossible to get things\nrepaired and so the whole greenhouse fell down.",
    "So did the little conservatory near the house.",
    "Both sisters sighed with the sighing of those who have noted time\npassing and times changing but not for the better.",
    "There was a melancholy here in this house thought Miss Marple.",
    "It\nwas impregnated somehow with sorrow  a sorrow that could not be\ndispersed or removed since it had penetrated too deep.",
    "It had sunk\nin... She shivered suddenly.",
    "Chapter 9\n\nPOLYGONUM BALDSCHUANICUM\n\nThe meal was conventional.",
    "A small joint of mutton roast potatoes\nfollowed by a plum tart with a small jug of cream and rather indifferent\npastry.",
    "There were a few pictures round the diningroom wall family\npictures Miss Marple presumed Victorian portraits without any\nparticular merit the sideboard was large and heavy a handsome\n\n\fpiece of plumcoloured mahogany.",
    "The curtains were of dark crimson\ndamask and at the big mahogany table ten people could easily have\nbeen seated.",
    "Miss Marple chatted about the incidents of the tour in so far as she had\nbeen on it.",
    "As this however had only been three days there was not\nvery much to say.",
    "Mr Rafiel I suppose was an old friend of yours said the eldest Miss\nBradburyScott.",
    "Not really said Miss Marple.",
    "I met him first when I was on a cruise\nto the West Indies.",
    "He was out there for his health I imagine.",
    "Yes he had been very crippled for some years said Anthea.",
    "Very sad said Miss Marple.",
    "Very sad indeed.",
    "I really admired his\nfortitude.",
    "He seemed to manage to do so much work.",
    "Every day you\nknow he dictated to his secretary and was continually sending off\ncables.",
    "He did not seem to give in at all kindly to being an invalid.",
    "Oh no he wouldnt said Anthea.",
    "We have not seen much of him of late years said Mrs Glynne.",
    "He\nwas a busy man of course.",
    "He always remembered us at Christmas\nvery kindly.",
    "Do you live in London Miss Marple asked Anthea.",
    "Oh no said Miss Marple.",
    "I live in the country.",
    "A very small place half\nway between Loomouth and Market Basing.",
    "About twentyfive miles\nfrom London.",
    "It used to be a very pretty oldworld village but of course\nlike everything else it is becoming what they call developed\nnowadays.",
    "She added Mr Rafiel I suppose lived in London At least I noticed\nthat in the St Honor\u00e9 register his address was somewhere in Eaton\nSquare I think or was it Belgrave Square\n\nHe had a country house in Kent said Clotilde.",
    "He used to entertain\nthere I think sometimes.",
    "Business friends mostly you know or\npeople from abroad.",
    "I dont think any of us ever visited him there.",
    "He\nnearly always entertained us in London on the rare occasions when we\nhappened to meet.",
    "It was very kind of him said Miss Marple to suggest to you that you\nshould invite me here during the course of this tour.",
    "Very thoughtful.",
    "One wouldnt really have expected a busy man such as he must have\nbeen to have had such kindly thoughts.",
    "We have invited before friends of his who have been on these tours.",
    "On the whole they are very considerate the way they arrange these\nthings...",
    "It is impossible of course to suit everybodys taste.",
    "The\nyoung ones naturally wish to walk to make long excursions to ascend\nhills for a view and all that sort of thing.",
    "And the older ones who are\nnot up to it remain in the hotels but hotels round here are not really at\nall luxurious.",
    "I am sure you would have found todays trip and the one\nto St Bonaventure tomorrow also very fatiguing.",
    "Tomorrow I believe\n\n\fthere is a visit to an island you know in a boat and sometimes it can\nbe very rough.",
    "Even going round houses can be very tiring said Mrs Glynne.",
    "Oh I know said Miss Marple.",
    "So much walking and standing about.",
    "Ones feet get very tired.",
    "I suppose really I ought not to take these\nexpeditions but it is such a temptation to see beautiful buildings and\nfine rooms and furniture.",
    "All these things.",
    "And of course some\nsplendid pictures.",
    "And the gardens said Anthea.",
    "You like gardens dont you\n\nOh yes said Miss Marple specially the gardens.",
    "From the\ndescription in the prospect I am really looking forward very much to\nseeing some of the really finely kept gardens of the historic houses we\nhave still to visit.",
    "She beamed round the table.",
    "It was all very pleasant very natural and yet she wondered why for\nsome reason she had a feeling of strain.",
    "A feeling that there was\nsomething unnatural here.",
    "But what did she mean by unnatural The\nconversation was ordinary enough consisting mainly of platitudes.",
    "She\nherself was making conventional remarks and so were the three\nsisters.",
    "The Three Sisters thought Miss Marple once again considering that\nphrase.",
    "Why did anything thought of in threes somehow seem to\nsuggest a sinister atmosphere\n\n\fThe Three Sisters.",
    "The Three Witches of Macbeth.",
    "Well one could\nhardly compare these three sisters to the three witches.",
    "Although Miss\nMarple had always thought at the back of her mind that the theatrical\nproducers made a mistake in the way in which they produced the three\nwitches.",
    "One production which she had seen indeed seemed to her\nquite absurd.",
    "The witches had looked more like pantomime creatures\nwith flapping wings and ridiculously spectacular steeple hats.",
    "They\nhad danced and slithered about.",
    "Miss Marple remembered saying to\nher nephew who was standing her this Shakespearean treat You\nknow Raymond my dear if I were ever producing this splendid play I\nwould make the three witches quite different.",
    "I would have them three\nordinary normal old women.",
    "Old Scottish women.",
    "They wouldnt\ndance or caper.",
    "They would look at each other rather slyly and you\nwould feel a sort of menace just behind the ordinariness of them.",
    "Miss Marple helped herself to the last mouthful of plum tart and looked\nacross the table at Anthea.",
    "Ordinary untidy very vaguelooking a bit\nscatty.",
    "Why should she feel that Anthea was sinister\n\nI am imagining things said Miss Marple to herself.",
    "I mustnt do\nthat.",
    "After luncheon she was taken on a tour of the garden.",
    "It was Anthea\nwho was deputed to accompany her.",
    "It was Miss Marple thought\nrather a sad progress.",
    "Here there had once been a well kept though certainly not in any way\nan outstanding or remarkable garden.",
    "It had had the elements of an\nordinary Victorian garden.",
    "A shrubbery a drive of speckled laurels no\ndoubt there had once been a well kept lawn and paths a kitchen\n\n\fgarden of about an acre and a half too big evidently for the three\nsisters who lived here now.",
    "Part of it was unplanted and had gone largely to weeds.",
    "Ground elder\nhad taken over most of the flower beds and Miss Marples hands could\nhardly restrain themselves from pulling up the vagrant bindweed\nasserting its superiority.",
    "Miss Antheas long hair flapped in the wind shedding from time to time\na vague hairpin on the path or the grass.",
    "She talked rather jerkily.",
    "You have a very nice garden I expect she said.",
    "Oh its a very small one said Miss Marple.",
    "They had come along a grass path and were pausing in front of a kind\nof hillock that rested against the wall at the end of it.",
    "Our greenhouse said Miss Anthea mournfully.",
    "Oh yes where you had such a delightful grapevine.",
    "Three vines said Anthea.",
    "A Black Hamburg and one of those small\nwhite grapes very sweet you know.",
    "And a third one of beautiful\nmuscats.",
    "And a heliotrope you said.",
    "Cherry Pie said Anthea.",
    "Ah yes Cherry Pie.",
    "Such a lovely smell.",
    "Was there any bomb trouble\nround here Did that  er  knock the greenhouse down\n\nOh no we never suffered from anything of that kind.",
    "This\nneighbourhood was quite free of bombs.",
    "No Im afraid it just fell down\nfrom decay.",
    "We hadnt been here so very long and we had no money to\nrepair it or to build it up again.",
    "And in fact it wouldnt have been worth\nit really because we couldnt have kept it up even if we did.",
    "Im afraid\nwe just let it fall down.",
    "There was nothing else we could do.",
    "And now\nyou see its all grown over.",
    "Ah that completely covered by  what is that flowering creeper just\ncoming into bloom\n\nOh yes.",
    "Its quite a common one said Anthea.",
    "It begins with a P.\nNow what is the name of it she said doubtfully.",
    "Poly something something like that.",
    "Oh yes.",
    "I think I do know the name.",
    "Polygonum Baldshuanicum.",
    "Very\nquick growing I think isnt it Very useful really if one wants to hide\nany tumbledown building or anything ugly of that kind.",
    "The mound in front of her was certainly thickly covered with the allenveloping green and white flowering plant.",
    "It was as Miss Marple well\nknew a kind of menace to anything else that wanted to grow.",
    "Polygonum covered everything and covered it in a remarkably short\ntime.",
    "The greenhouse must have been quite a big one she said.",
    "Oh yes we had peaches in it too  and nectarines.",
    "Anthea looked\nmiserable.",
    "It looks really very pretty now said Miss Marple in a consoling tone.",
    "Very pretty little white flowers arent they\n\nWe have a very nice magnolia tree down this path to the left said\nAnthea.",
    "Once I believe there used to be a very fine border here  a\nherbaceous border.",
    "But that again one cannot keep up.",
    "It is too\ndifficult.",
    "Everything is too difficult.",
    "Nothing is like it used to be  its all\nspoilt  everywhere.",
    "She led the way quickly down a path at rightangles which ran along a\nside wall.",
    "Her pace had increased.",
    "Miss Marple could hardly keep up\nwith her.",
    "It was thought Miss Marple as though she were deliberately\nbeing steered away from the Polygonum mound by her hostess.",
    "Steered away as from some ugly or displeasing spot.",
    "Was she\nashamed perhaps that the past glories no longer remained The\nPolygonum certainly was growing with extraordinary abandonment.",
    "It\nwas not even being clipped or kept to reasonable proportions.",
    "It made\na kind of flowery wilderness of that bit of the garden.",
    "She almost looks as though she was running away from it thought\nMiss Marple as she followed her hostess.",
    "Presently her attention was diverted to a broken down pigsty which\nhad a few rose tendrils round it.",
    "My greatuncle used to keep a few pigs explained Anthea but of\ncourse one would never dream of doing anything of that kind\nnowadays would one Rather too noisome I am afraid.",
    "We have a few\nfioribunda roses near the house.",
    "I really think fioribundas are such a\ngreat answer to difficulties.",
    "Oh I know said Miss Marple.",
    "She mentioned the names of a few recent productions in the rose line.",
    "All the names she thought were entirely strange to Miss Anthea.",
    "Do you often come on these tours The question came suddenly.",
    "You mean the tours of houses and of gardens\n\nYes.",
    "Some people do it every year.",
    "Oh I couldnt hope to do that.",
    "Theyre rather expensive you see.",
    "A\nfriend very kindly gave me a present of this to celebrate my next\nbirthday.",
    "So kind.",
    "Oh.",
    "I wondered.",
    "I wondered why you came.",
    "I mean its bound to be\nrather tiring isnt it Still if you usually go to the West Indies and\nplaces like that...\n\nOh the West Indies was the result of kindness too.",
    "On the part of a\nnephew that time.",
    "A dear boy.",
    "So very thoughtful for his old aunt.",
    "Oh I see.",
    "Yes I see.",
    "I dont know what one would do without the younger generation said\nMiss Marple.",
    "They are so kind are they not\n\nI  I suppose so.",
    "I dont really know.",
    "I  we havent  any young\nrelations.",
    "Does your sister Mrs Glynne have any children She did not mention\nany.",
    "One never likes to ask.",
    "No.",
    "She and her husband never had any children.",
    "Its as well\nperhaps.",
    "And what do you mean by that Miss Marple wondered as they\nreturned to the house.",
    "Chapter 10\n\nOH FOND OH FAIR THE DAYS THAT WERE\n\nAt half past eight the next morning there was a smart tap on the door\nand in answer to Miss Marples Come in the door was opened and an\nelderly woman entered bearing a tray with a teapot a cup and a milk\njug and a small plate of bread and butter.",
    "Early morning tea maam she said cheerfully.",
    "Its a nice day it is.",
    "I\nsee youve got your curtains drawn back already.",

    "So kind of Miss\nBradburyScott and Mrs Glynne to issue this invitation.",
    "Oh well its nice for them too.",
    "It cheers them up to have a bit of\ncompany come to the house.",
    "Ah its a sad place nowadays so it is.",
    "She pulled the curtains at the window rather more fully pushed back a\nchair and deposited a can of hot water in the china basin.",
    "Theres a bathroom on the next floor she said but we think its\nbetter always for someone elderly to have their hot water here so they\ndont have to climb the stairs.",
    "Its very kind of you Im sure you know this house well\n\nI was here as a girl  I was the housemaid then.",

    "When he died he left\nthe place to his niece Miss Clotilde and her two sisters and she and\nMiss Anthea came here to live  and later Miss Lavinia lost her husband\nand came to join them  she sighed and shook her head.",
    "They never\ndid much to the house  couldnt afford it and they let the garden go as\nwell...",
    "It all seems a great pity said Miss Marple.",
    "And such nice ladies as they all are too.",
    "Miss Anthea is the scatty\none but Miss Clotilde went to university and is very brainy she talks\nthree languages and Mrs Glynne shes a very nice lady indeed.",
    "I\nthought when she came to join them as things might go better.",

    "Clotilde has had to tell her that really one cant afford that\nnowadays.",
    "But she keeps talking of the hothouses the peaches that\nused to be there.",
    "The grapes  and all that.",
    "And the Cherry Pie on the walls suggested Miss Marple\nremembering a remark.",
    "Fancy your remembering that.",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes its one of the things one\ndoes remember.",
    "Such a charming smell heliotrope.",
    "And such a nice\nname for it Cherry Pie.",

    "Yes.",

    "It must be difficult for you.",
    "Well yes.",
    "Arguments you see hardly appeal in any way.",
    "Clotilde of\ncourse is very downright about things.",
    "She just refuses pointblank\nand says she doesnt want to hear another word about it.",
    "It is difficult said Miss Marple to know how to take things.",
    "Whether\none should be firm.",
    "Rather authoritative.",
    "Perhaps even well just a\nlittle... a little fierce you know or whether one should be sympathetic.",
    "Listen to things and perhaps hold out hopes which one knows are not\njustified.",
    "Yes its difficult.",
    "But its easier for me because you see I go away again and then\ncome back now and then to stay.",
    "So its easy for me to pretend things\nmay be easier soon and that something may be done.",
    "But really the\nother day when I came home and I found that Anthea had tried to\nengage a most expensive firm of landscape gardeners to renovate the\ngarden to build up the greenhouse again  which is quite absurd\nbecause even if you put vines in they would not bear for another two or\nthree years.",

    "Theres an interesting church to\nsee on the way and a castle.",
    "In the afternoon there is a quite pleasant\ngarden not too many acres but some special flowers.",
    "I feel sure that\n\n\fafter this very nice rest that I have had here I shall be quite all right.",

    "Miss Marple has been to\nvisit the church said Mrs Glynne to Clotilde.",

    "She went to bed tired with a sense of failure.",
    "She had learned nothing\nmore possibly because there was nothing more to learn.",
    "A fishing\nexpedition where the fish did not rise possibly because there were no\nfish there.",
    "Or it could be that she did not know the right bait to use\n\nChapter 11\n\n\fACCIDENT\n\nMiss Marples tea was brought at seventhirty the following morning so\nas to allow her plenty of time to get up and pack her few belongings.",
    "She was just closing her small suitcase when there was a rather\nhurried tap on the door and Clotilde came in looking upset.",
    "Oh dear Miss Marple there is a young man downstairs who has\ncalled to see you.",
    "Emlyn Price.",
    "He is on the tour with you and they sent\nhim here.",
    "Of course I remember him.",
    "Yes.",
    "Quite young\n\nOh yes.",
    "Very modernlooking and a lot of hair and all that but he has\nreally come to  well to break some bad news to you.",
    "There has been I\nam sorry to say an accident.",
    "An accident Miss Marple stared.",
    "You mean  to the coach There\nhas been an accident on the road Someone has been hurt\n\nNo.",
    "No it was not the coach.",
    "There was no trouble there.",
    "It was in the\ncourse of the expedition yesterday afternoon.",
    "There was a great deal\nof wind you may remember though I dont think that had anything to\ndo with it.",
    "People strayed about a bit I think.",
    "There is a regular path\nbut you can also climb up and go across the downs.",
    "Both ways lead to\nthe Memorial Tower on the top of Bonaventure where they were all\nmaking for.",
    "People got separated a bit and I suppose really there was\n\n\fno one actually guiding them or looking after them which perhaps\nthere ought to have been.",
    "People arent very surefooted always and\nthe slope overhanging the gorge is very steep.",
    "There was a bad fall of\nstones or rocks which came crashing down the hillside and knocked\nsomeone out on the path below.",
    "Oh dear said Miss Marple I am sorry.",
    "I am most terribly sorry.",
    "Who\nwas it who was hurt\n\nA Miss Temple or Tenderdon I understand.",
    "Elizabeth Temple said Miss Marple.",
    "Oh dear I am sorry.",
    "I talked to\nher a good deal.",
    "I sat in the next seat to her on the coach.",
    "She is I\nbelieve a retired schoolmistress a very well known one.",
    "Of course said Clotilde I know her quite well.",
    "She was\nHeadmistress of Fallowfield quite a famous school.",
    "Id no idea she was\non this tour.",
    "She retired as Headmistress I think a year or two ago\nand there is a new rather young Headmistress there now with rather\nadvanced progressive ideas.",
    "But Miss Temple is not very old really\nshes about sixty I should think and very active fond of climbing and\nwalking and all the rest of it.",
    "This really seems most unfortunate.",
    "I\nhope shes not badly hurt.",
    "I havent heard any details yet.",
    "This is quite ready now said Miss Marple snapping down the lid of\nher suitcase.",
    "I will come down at once and see Mr Price.",

    "Emlyn Price was waiting for her.",
    "His hair was\nlooking even wilder than usual and he was wearing a splendid array of\nfancy boots and a leather jerkin and brilliant emerald green trousers.",
    "Such an unfortunate business he said seizing Miss Marples hand.",
    "I\nthought Id come along myself and  well break it to you about the\naccident.",
    "I expect Miss BradburyScott has told you.",
    "Its Miss Temple.",
    "You know.",
    "The school dame.",
    "I dont know quite what she was doing or\nwhat happened but some stones or rather boulders rolled down from\nabove.",
    "Its rather a precipitous slope and it knocked her out and they\nhad to take her off to hospital with concussion last night.",
    "I gather shes\nrather bad.",
    "Anyway the tour for today is cancelled and we are\nstopping on here tonight.",
    "Oh dear said Miss Marple I am sorry.",
    "Im very sorry.",
    "I think theyve decided not to go on today because they really have to\nwait and see what the medical report is so we are proposing to spend\none more night here at the Golden Boar and to rearrange the tour a\nlittle so that perhaps we shall miss out altogether going to\nGrangmering which we were going to do tomorrow and which is not\nvery interesting really or so they say.",
    "Mrs Sandbourne has gone off\nearly to the hospital to see how things are this morning.",
    "Shes going to\njoin us at the Golden Boar for coffee at 11 oclock.",

    "Ill certainly come along with you said Miss Marple.",
    "Of course.",
    "At\nonce.",
    "She turned to say goodbye to Clotilde and Mrs Glynne who had joined\nher.",

    "You have been so kind and it\nhas been so delightful to have these two nights here.",
    "I feel so rested\nand everything.",
    "Most unfortunate this has occurred.",
    "If you would like to spend another night said Mrs Glynne I am sure\n She looked at Clotilde.",
    "It occurred to Miss Marple who had as sharp a sideways glance as\nanyone could desire that Clotilde had a slightly disapproving look.",
    "She\nalmost shook her head though it was such a small movement that it\nwas hardly noticeable.",
    "But she was Miss Marple thought hushing\ndown the suggestion that Mrs Glynne was making.",
    "... although of course I expect it would be nicer for you to be with the\nothers and to \n\nOh yes I think it would be better said Miss Marple.",
    "I shall know\nthen what the plans are and what to do about things and perhaps I\ncould be of help in some way.",
    "One never knows.",
    "So thank you again\nvery much.",
    "It will not be difficult I expect to get a room at the Golden\nBoar.",
    "She looked at Emlyn who said reassuringly\n\nThatll be all right.",
    "Several rooms have been vacated today.",
    "They\nwont be full at all.",

    "Goodbyes were said again and thanks.",
    "Emlyn Price took Miss Marples belongings and started out at a good\nstriding pace.",
    "Its really only just round the corner and then the first street to the\nleft he said.",
    "Yes I passed it yesterday I think.",
    "Poor Miss Temple.",
    "I do hope shes\nnot badly hurt.",
    "I think she is rather said Emlyn Price.",
    "Of course you know what\ndoctors are and hospital people.",
    "They say the same We must not give\nup hope.",
    "Theres no local hospital they had to take her to Carristown\nwhich is about eight miles away.",
    "Anyway Mrs Sandbourne will be back\nwith the news by the time weve fixed you up at the hotel.",
    "They got there to find the tour assembled in the coffee room and coffee\nand morning buns and pastries were being served.",
    "Mr and Mrs Butler\nwere talking at the moment.",
    "Oh its just too too tragic this happening said Mrs Butler.",
    "Just too\nupsetting isnt it Just when we were all so happy and enjoying\neverything so much.",
    "Poor Miss Temple.",
    "And I always thought she was\nvery surefooted.",
    "But there you know you never can tell can you\nHenry\n\n\fNo indeed said Henry.",
    "No indeed.",
    "I am wondering really  yes our\ntimes very short  you know  whether we hadnt better  well give up\nthis tour at this point here.",
    "Not continue with it.",
    "It seems to me theres\nbound to be a bit of difficulty resuming things until we know definitely.",
    "If this was well I mean if this should be so serious that it could prove\nfatal there might well I mean there might have to be an inquest or\nsomething of that kind.",
    "Oh Henry dont say dreadful things like that\n\nIm sure said Miss Cooke that you are being a little too pessimistic\nMr Butler.",

    "Professor Wanstead and Miss Marple remained.",
    "I think myself said Professor Wanstead addressing Miss Marple\nthat it would be pleasant to sit outside the hotel.",
    "There is a small\nterrace giving on the street.",
    "If I might persuade you\n\nMiss Marple thanked him and rose to her feet.",
    "She had hardly\nexchanged a word so far with Professor Wanstead.",
    "He had several\nlearned looking books with him one of which he was usually perusing\neven in the coach he continued to try and read.",
    "But perhaps you too want to shop he said.",
    "For myself I would\nprefer to wait somewhere peacefully for the return of Mrs Sandbourne.",
    "It is important I think that we should know exactly what we are in for.",
    "I quite agree with you as to that said Miss Marple.",
    "I did a certain\namount of walking round the town yesterday and I dont feel any\nnecessity to do so again today.",
    "Id rather wait here in case there is\nanything I can do to help.",
    "Not that I suppose there is but one never\nknows.",
    "They moved together through the hotel door and round the corner to\nwhere there was a little square of garden with a raised stone walk\nclose to the wall of the hotel and on which there were various forms of\nbasket chairs.",
    "There was no one there at the moment so they sat\ndown.",
    "Miss Marple looked thoughtfully at her vis\u00e0vis.",
    "At his\ncorrugated and wrinkled face his bushy brows his luxuriant head of\ngrey hair.",
    "He walked with a slight stoop.",
    "He had an interesting face\nMiss Marple decided.",
    "His voice was dry and caustic a professional\nman of some kind she thought.",
    "I am not wrong am I said Professor Wanstead.",
    "You are Miss Jane\nMarple\n\nYes I am Jane Marple.",
    "She was slightly surprised though for no particular reason.",
    "They had\nnot been long enough together for people to be identified by the other\ntravellers.",
    "The last two nights she had not been with the rest of the\nparty.",
    "It was quite natural.",
    "I thought so said Professor Wanstead from a description I have\nhad of you.",
    "A description of me Miss Marple was again slightly surprised.",
    "Yes I had a description of you  he paused for a moment.",
    "His voice\nwas not exactly lowered but it lost volume although she could still\nhear it quite easily.",
    "From Mr Rafiel.",
    "Oh said Miss Marple startled.",
    "From Mr Rafiel.",
    "You are surprised\n\nWell yes I am rather.",
    "I dont know that you should be.",
    "I didnt expect began Miss Marple and then stopped.",
    "Professor Wanstead did not speak.",
    "He was merely sitting looking at\nher intently.",
    "In a minute or two thought Miss Marple to herself he will\nsay to me What symptoms exactly dear lady Any discomfort in\nswallowing Any lack of sleep Digestion in good order She was\nalmost sure now that he was a doctor.",
    "When did he describe me to you That must have been \n\nYou were going to say some time ago  some weeks ago.",
    "Before his\ndeath that is so.",
    "He told me that you would be on this tour.",
    "And he knew that you would be on it too that you were going on it.",
    "You can put it that way said Professor Wanstead.",
    "He said he\ncontinued that you would be travelling on this tour that he had in fact\narranged for you to be travelling on this tour.",
    "It was very kind of him said Miss Marple.",
    "Very kind indeed.",
    "I was\nmost surprised when I found hed booked me.",
    "Such a treat.",
    "Which I\ncould not have afforded for myself.",
    "Yes said Professor Wanstead.",
    "Very well put.",
    "He nodded his head\nas one who applauds a good performance by a pupil.",
    "It is sad that it has been interrupted in this fashion said Miss Marple.",
    "Very sad indeed.",
    "When I am sure we were all enjoying ourselves so\nmuch.",
    "Yes said Professor Wanstead.",
    "Yes very sad.",
    "And unexpected do\nyou think or not unexpected\n\nNow what do you mean by that Professor Wanstead\n\nHis lips curled in a slight smile as he met her challenging look.",
    "Mr Rafiel he said spoke to me about you at some length Miss\nMarple.",
    "He suggested that I should be on this tour with you.",
    "I should in\ndue course almost certainly make your acquaintance since members\nin a tour inevitably do make each others acquaintance though it\nusually takes a day or two for them to split up as it were into possible\ngroupings led by similar tastes or interests.",
    "And he further suggested\nto me that I should shall we say keep an eye on you.",
    "Keep an eye on me said Miss Marple showing some slight\ndispleasure.",
    "And for what reason\n\nI think reasons of protection.",
    "He wanted to be quite sure that nothing\nshould happen to you.",
    "Happen to me What should happen to me I should like to know\n\n\fPossibly what happened to Miss Elizabeth Temple said Professor\nWanstead.",
    "Joanna Crawford came round the corner of the hotel.",
    "She was\ncarrying a shopping basket.",
    "She passed them nodding a little she\nlooked towards them with slight curiosity and went on down the street.",
    "Professor Wanstead did not speak until she had gone out of sight.",
    "A nice girl he said at least I think so.",
    "Content at present to be a\nbeast of burden to an autocratic aunt but I have no doubt will reach\nthe age of rebellion fairly soon.",
    "What did you mean by what you said just now said Miss Marple\nuninterested for the moment in Joannas possible rebellion.",
    "That is a question which perhaps owing to what has happened we\nshall have to discuss.",
    "You mean because of the accident\n\nYes.",
    "If it was an accident.",
    "Do you think it wasnt an accident\n\nWell I think its just possible.",
    "Thats all.",
    "I dont of course know anything about it said Miss Marple hesitating.",
    "No.",
    "You were absent from the scene.",
    "You were  shall I put it this way\nwere you just possibly on duty elsewhere\n\n\fMiss Marple was silent for a moment.",
    "She looked at Professor\nWanstead once or twice and then she said\n\nI dont think I know exactly what you mean.",
    "You are being careful.",
    "You are right to be careful.",
    "I have made it a habit said Miss Marple.",
    "To be careful\n\nI should not put it exactly like that but I have made a point of being\nalways ready to disbelieve as well as believe anything that is told to\nme.",
    "Yes and you are quite right too.",
    "You dont know anything about me.",
    "You know my name from the passenger list of a very agreeable tour\nvisiting castles and historic houses and splendid gardens.",
    "Possibly the\ngardens are what will interest you most.",
    "Possibly.",
    "There are other people here too who are interested in gardens.",
    "Or profess to be interested in gardens.",
    "Ah said Professor Wanstead.",
    "You have noticed that.",
    "He went on\nWell it was my part or at any rate to begin with to observe you to\nwatch what you were doing to be near at hand in case there was any\n\n\fpossibility of  well we might call it roughly dirty work of any kind.",
    "But\nthings are slightly altered now.",
    "You must make up your mind if I am\nyour enemy or your ally.",
    "Perhaps you are right said Miss Marple.",
    "You put it very clearly but\nyou have not given me any information about yourself yet on which to\njudge.",
    "You were a friend I presume of the late Mr Rafiel\n\nNo said Professor Wanstead.",
    "I was not a friend of Mr Rafiel.",
    "I had\nmet him once or twice.",
    "Once on a committee of a hospital once at\nsome other public event.",
    "I knew about him.",
    "He I gather also knew\nabout me.",
    "If I say to you Miss Marple that I am a man of some\neminence in my own profession you may think me a man of bounding\nconceit.",
    "I dont think so said Miss Marple.",
    "I should say if you say that about\nyourself that you are probably speaking the truth.",
    "You are perhaps a\nmedical man.",
    "Ah.",
    "You are perceptive Miss Marple.",
    "Yes you are quite perceptive.",
    "I\nhave a medical degree but I have a specialty too.",
    "I am a pathologist\nand psychologist.",
    "I dont carry credentials about with me.",
    "You will\nprobably have to take my word up to a certain point though I can show\nyou letters addressed to me and possibly official documents that\nmight convince you.",
    "I undertake mainly specialist work in connection\nwith medical jurisprudence.",
    "To put it in perfectly plain everyday\nlanguage I am interested in the different types of criminal brain.",
    "That\nhas been a study of mine for many years.",
    "I have written books on the\nsubject some of them violently disputed some of them which have\nattracted adherence to my ideas.",
    "I do not do very arduous work\n\n\fnowadays.",
    "I spend my time mainly writing up my subject stressing\ncertain points that have appealed to me.",
    "From time to time I come\nacross things that strike me as interesting.",
    "Things that I want to study\nmore closely.",
    "This I am afraid must seem rather tedious to you.",
    "Not at all said Miss Marple.",
    "I am hoping perhaps from what you are\nsaying now that you will be able to explain to me certain things which\nMr Rafiel did not see fit to explain to me.",
    "He asked me to embark upon\na certain project but he gave me no useful information on which to\nwork.",
    "He left me to accept it and proceed as it were completely in the\ndark.",
    "It seemed to me extremely foolish of him to treat the matter in\nthat way.",
    "But you accepted it\n\nI accepted it.",
    "I will be quite honest with you.",
    "I had a financial\nincentive.",
    "Did that weigh with you\n\nMiss Marple was silent for a moment and then she said slowly You\nmay not believe it but my answer to that is Not really.",
    "I am not surprised.",
    "But your interest was aroused.",
    "That is what you\nare trying to tell me.",
    "Yes.",
    "My interest was aroused.",
    "I had known Mr Rafiel not well\ncasually but for a certain period of time some weeks in fact  in the\nWest Indies.",
    "I see you know about it more or less.",
    "I know that that was where Mr Rafiel met you and where  shall I say you two collaborated.",
    "Miss Marple looked at him rather doubtfully.",
    "Oh she said he said\nthat did he She shook her head.",
    "Yes he did said Professor Wanstead.",
    "He said you had a\nremarkable flair for criminal matters.",
    "Miss Marple raised her eyebrows as she looked at him.",
    "And I suppose that seems to you most unlikely she said.",
    "It\nsurprises you.",
    "I seldom allow myself to be surprised at what happens said\nProfessor Wanstead.",
    "Mr Rafiel was a very shrewd and astute man a\ngood judge of people.",
    "He thought that you too were a good judge of\npeople.",
    "I would not set myself up as a good judge of people said Miss\nMarple.",
    "I would only say that certain people remind me of certain\nother people that I have known and that therefore I can presuppose a\ncertain likeness between the way they would act.",
    "If you think I know all\nabout what I am supposed to be doing here you are wrong.",
    "By accident more than design said Professor Wanstead we seem\nto have settled here in a particularly suitable spot for discussion of\ncertain matters.",
    "We do not appear to be overlooked we cannot easily\nbe overheard we are not near a window or a door and there is no\nbalcony or window overhead.",
    "In fact we can talk.",
    "I should appreciate that said Miss Marple.",
    "I am stressing the fact\nthat I am myself completely in the dark as to what I am doing or\nsupposed to be doing.",
    "I dont know why Mr Rafiel wanted it that way.",
    "I think I can guess that.",
    "He wanted you to approach a certain set of\nfacts of happenings unbiased by what anyone would tell you first.",
    "So you are not going to tell me anything either Miss Marple\nsounded irritated.",
    "Really she said there are limits.",
    "Yes said Professor Wanstead.",
    "He smiled suddenly.",
    "I agree with\nyou.",
    "We must do away with some of these limits.",
    "I am going to tell you\ncertain facts that will make certain things fairly clear to you.",
    "You in\nturn may be able to tell me certain facts.",
    "I rather doubt it said Miss Marple.",
    "One or two rather peculiar\nindications perhaps but indications are not facts.",
    "Therefore  said Professor Wanstead and paused.",
    "For goodness sake tell me something said Miss Marple.",
    "Chapter 12\n\nA CONSULTATION\n\n\fIm not going to make a long story of things.",
    "Ill explain quite simply\nhow I came into this matter.",
    "I act as confidential adviser from time to\ntime for the Home Office.",
    "I am also in touch with certain institutions.",
    "There are certain establishments which in the event of crime provide\nboard and lodging for certain types of criminal who have been found\nguilty of certain acts.",
    "They remain there at what is termed Her\nMajestys pleasure sometimes for a definite length of time and in\ndirect association with their age.",
    "If they are below a certain age they\nhave to be received in some place of detention specially indicated.",
    "You\nunderstand that no doubt.",
    "Yes I understand quite well what you mean.",
    "Usually I am consulted fairly soon after whatever the  shall we call it\ncrime  has happened to judge such matters as treatment\npossibilities in the case prognosis favourable or unfavourable all the\nvarious words.",
    "They do not mean much and I will not go into them.",
    "But\noccasionally also I am consulted by a responsible Head of such an\ninstitution for a particular reason.",
    "In this matter I received a\ncommunication from a certain Department which was passed to me\nthrough the Home Office.",
    "I went to visit the Head of this institution.",
    "In\nfact the Governor responsible for the prisoners or patients or\nwhatever you like to call them.",
    "He was by way of being a friend of\nmine.",
    "A friend of fairly long standing though not one with whom I was\non terms of great intimacy.",
    "I went down to the institution in question\nand the Governor laid his troubles before me.",
    "They referred to one\nparticular inmate.",
    "He was not satisfied about this inmate.",
    "He had\ncertain doubts.",
    "This was the case of a young man or one who had been\na young man in fact little more than a boy when he came there.",
    "That\n\n\fwas now several years ago.",
    "As time went on and after the present\nGovernor had taken up his own residence there he had not been there\nat the original arrival of this prisoner he became worried.",
    "Not\nbecause he himself was a professional man but because he was a\nman of experience of criminal patients and prisoners.",
    "To put it quite\nsimply this had been a boy who from his early youth had been\ncompletely unsatisfactory.",
    "You can call it by what term you like.",
    "A\nyoung delinquent a young thug a bad lot a person of diminished\nresponsibility.",
    "There are many terms.",
    "Some of them fit some of them\ndont fit some of them are merely puzzling.",
    "He was a criminal type.",
    "That was certain.",
    "He had joined gangs he had beaten up people he\nwas a thief he had stolen he had embezzled he had taken part in\nswindles he had initiated certain frauds.",
    "In fact he was a son who\nwould be any fathers despair.",
    "Oh I see said Miss Marple.",
    "And what do you see Miss Marple\n\nWell what I think I see is that you are talking of Mr Rafiels son.",
    "You are quite right.",
    "I am talking of Mr Rafiels son.",
    "What do you know\nabout him\n\nNothing said Miss Marple.",
    "I only heard... and that was yesterday\nthat Mr Rafiel had a delinquent or unsatisfactory if we like to put it\nmildly son.",
    "A son with a criminal record.",
    "I know very little about him.",
    "Was he Mr Rafiels only son\n\n\fYes he was Mr Rafiels only son.",
    "But Mr Rafiel also had two\ndaughters.",
    "One of them died when she was fourteen the elder\ndaughter married quite happily but had no children.",
    "Very sad for him.",
    "Possibly said Professor Wanstead.",
    "One never knows.",
    "His wife died\nyoung and I think it possible that her death saddened him very much\nthough he was never willing to show it.",
    "How much he cared for his son\nand daughters I dont know.",
    "He provided for them.",
    "He did his best for\nthem.",
    "He did his best for this son but what his feelings were one\ncannot say.",
    "He was not an easy man to read that way.",
    "I think his whole\nlife and interest lay in his profession of making money.",
    "It was the\nmaking of it like all great financiers that interested him.",
    "Not the actual\nmoney which he secured by it.",
    "That as you might say was sent out\nlike a good servant to earn more money in more interesting and\nunexpected ways.",
    "He enjoyed finance.",
    "He loved finance.",
    "He thought of\nvery little else.",
    "I think he did all that was possible for his son.",
    "He got him out of\nscrapes at school he employed good lawyers to get him released from\nCourt proceedings whenever possible but the final blow came\nperhaps presaged by some early happenings.",
    "The boy was taken to\nCourt on a charge of assault against a young girl.",
    "It was said to be\nassault and rape and he suffered a term of imprisonment for it with\nsome leniency shown because of his youth.",
    "But later a second and\nreally serious charge was brought against him.",
    "He killed a girl said Miss Marple.",
    "Is that right Thats what I heard.",
    "He lured a girl away from her home.",
    "It was some time before her body\nwas found.",
    "She had been strangled.",
    "And afterwards her face and head\nhad been disfigured by some heavy stones or rocks presumably to\nprevent her identity being made known.",
    "Not a very nice business said Miss Marple in her most oldladylike\ntone.",
    "Professor Wanstead looked at her for a moment or two.",
    "You describe it that way\n\nIt is how it seems to me said Miss Marple.",
    "I dont like that sort of\nthing.",
    "I never have.",
    "If you expect me to feel sympathy regret urge an\nunhappy childhood blame bad environment if you expect me in fact to\nweep over him this young murderer of yours I do not feel inclined so\nto do.",
    "I do not like evil beings who do evil things.",
    "I am delighted to hear it said Professor Wanstead.",
    "What I suffer in\nthe course of my profession from people weeping and gnashing their\nteeth and blaming everything on some happening in the past you\nwould hardly believe.",
    "If people knew the bad environments that people\nhave had the unkindness the difficulties of their lives and the fact that\nnevertheless they can come through scathed I dont think they would\nso often take the opposite point of view.",
    "The misfits are to be pitied\nyes they are to be pitied if I may say so for the genes with which they\nare born and over which they have no control themselves.",
    "I pity\nepileptics in the same way.",
    "If you know what genes are \n\n\fI know more or less said Miss Marple.",
    "Its common knowledge\nnowadays though naturally I have no exact chemical or technical\nknowledge.",
    "The Governor a man of experience told me exactly why he was so\nanxious to have my verdict.",
    "He had felt increasingly in his experience\nof this particular inmate that in plain words the boy was not a killer.",
    "He didnt think he was the type of a killer he was like no killer he had\never seen before he was of the opinion that the boy was the kind of\ncriminal type who would never go straight no matter what treatment\nwas given to him would never reform himself and for whom nothing in\none sense of the word could be done but at the same time he felt\nincreasingly certain that the verdict upon him had been a wrong one.",
    "He did not believe that the boy had killed a girl first strangled her and\nthen disfigured her after rolling her body into a ditch.",
    "He just couldnt\nbring himself to believe it.",
    "Hed looked over the facts of the case\nwhich seemed to be fully proved.",
    "This boy had known the girl he had\nbeen seen with her on several different occasions before the crime.",
    "They had presumably slept together and there were other points.",
    "His\ncar had been seen in the neighbourhood.",
    "He himself had been\nrecognised and all the rest of it.",
    "A perfectly fair case.",
    "But my friend\nwas unhappy about it he said.",
    "He was a man who had a very strong\nfeeling for justice.",
    "He wanted a different opinion.",
    "He wanted in fact\nnot the police side which he knew he wanted a professional medical\nview.",
    "That was my field he said.",
    "My line of country entirely.",
    "He wanted\nme to see this young man and talk with him visit him make a\nprofessional appraisal of him and give him my opinion.",
    "Very interesting said Miss Marple.",
    "Yes I call that very interesting.",
    "After all your friend  I mean your Governor was a man of experience\n\n\fa man who loved justice.",
    "He was a man whom youd be willing to listen\nto.",
    "Presumably then you did listen to him.",
    "Yes said Professor Wanstead I was deeply interested.",
    "I saw the\nsubject as I will call him I approached him from several different\nattitudes.",
    "I talked to him I discussed various changes likely to occur in\nthe law.",
    "I told him it might be possible to bring down a lawyer a\nQueens Counsel to see what points there might be in his favour and\nother things.",
    "I approached him as a friend but also as an enemy so\nthat I could see how he responded to different approaches and I also\nmade a good many physical tests such as we use very frequently\nnowadays.",
    "I will not go into those with you because they are wholly\ntechnical.",
    "Then what did you think in the end\n\nI thought said Professor Wanstead I thought my friend was likely\nto be right.",
    "I did not think that Michael Rafiel was a murderer.",
    "What about the earlier case you mentioned\n\nThat told against him of course.",
    "Not in the jurys mind because of\ncourse they did not hear about that until after the judges summing up\nbut certainly in the judges mind.",
    "It told against him but I made a few\nenquiries myself afterwards.",
    "He had assaulted a girl.",
    "He had\nconceivably raped her but he had not tempted to strangle her and in\nmy opinion I have seen a great many cases which come before the\nAssizes it seemed to me highly unlikely that there was a very definite\ncase of rape.",
    "Girls you must remember are far more ready to be\nraped nowadays than they used to be.",
    "Their mothers insist very often\n\n\fthat they should call it rape.",
    "The girl in question had had several\nboyfriends who had gone further than friendship.",
    "I did not think it\ncounted very greatly as evidence against him.",
    "The actual murder case\nyes that was undoubtedly murder but I continued to feel by all tests\nphysical tests mental tests psychological tests none of them\naccorded with this particular crime.",
    "Then what did you do\n\nI communicated with Mr Rafiel.",
    "I told him that I would like an interview\nwith him on a certain matter concerning his son.",
    "I went to him.",
    "I told\nhim what I thought what the Governor thought that we had no\nevidence that there were no grounds of appeal at present but that\nwe both believed that a miscarriage of justice had been committed.",
    "I\nsaid I thought possibly an enquiry might be held it might be an\nexpensive business it might bring out certain facts that could be laid\nbefore the Home Office it might be successful it might not.",
    "There\nmight be something there some evidence if you looked for it.",
    "I said it\nwould be expensive to look for it but I presumed that would make no\ndifference to anyone in his position.",
    "I had realised by that time that he\nwas a sick man a very ill man.",
    "He told me so himself.",
    "He told me that\nhe had been in expectation of an early death that hed been warned\ntwo years ago that death could not be delayed for what they first\nthought was about a year but later they realised that he would last\nrather longer because of his unusual physical strength.",
    "I asked him\nwhat he felt about his son.",
    "And what did he feel about his son said Miss Marple.",
    "Ah you want to know that.",
    "So did I.",
    "He was I think extremely honest\nwith me even if \n\n even if rather ruthless said Miss Marple.",
    "Yes Miss Marple.",
    "You are using the right word.",
    "He was a ruthless\nman but he was a just man and an honest man.",
    "He said Ive known\nwhat my son was like for many years.",
    "I have not tried to change him\nbecause I dont believe that anyone could change him.",
    "He is made a\ncertain way.",
    "He is crooked.",
    "Hes a bad lot.",
    "Hell always be in trouble.",
    "Hes dishonest.",
    "Nobody nothing could me him go straight.",
    "I am well\nassured of that.",
    "I have in a sense washed my hands of him.",
    "Though not\nlegally or outwardly he has always had money if he required it.",
    "Help legal or otherwise  if he gets into trouble.",
    "I have done always what I\ncould do.",
    "Well let us say if I had a son who was a spastic who was\nsick who was epileptic I would do what I could for him.",
    "If you have a\nson who is sick morally shall we say and for whom there is no cure I\nhave done what I could also.",
    "No more and no less.",
    "What can I do for\nhim now I told him that it depended on what he wanted to do.",
    "Theres\nno difficulty about that he said.",
    "I am handicapped but I can see quite\nclearly what I want to do.",
    "I want to get him vindicated.",
    "I want to get him\nreleased from confinement.",
    "I want to get him free to continue to lead\nhis own life as best he can lead it.",
    "If he must lead it in further\ndishonesties then he must lead it that way.",
    "I will leave provision for\nhim to do for him everything that can be done.",
    "I dont want him\nsuffering imprisoned cut off from his life because of a perfectly\nnatural and unfortunate mistake.",
    "If somebody else some other man\nkilled that girl I want the fact brought to light and recognised.",
    "I want\njustice for Michael.",
    "But I am handicapped.",
    "I am a very ill man.",
    "My time\nis measured now not in years or months but in weeks.",
    "Lawyers I suggested  I know a firm  He cut me short.",
    "Your lawyers\nwill be useless.",
    "You can employ them but they will be useless.",
    "I must\narrange what I can arrange in such a limited time.",
    "He offered me a\nlarge fee to undertake the search for the truth and to undertake\neverything possible with no expense spared.",
    "I can do next to nothing\nmyself.",
    "Death may come at any moment.",
    "I empower you as my chief\nhelp and to assist you at my request I will try to find a certain person.",
    "He wrote down a name for me.",
    "Miss Jane Marple.",
    "He said I dont want\nto give you her address.",
    "I want you to meet her in surroundings of my\nown choosing and he then told me of this tour this charming\nharmless innocent tour of historic houses castles and gardens.",
    "He\nwould provide me with a reservation on it ahead for a certain date.",
    "Miss Jane Marple he said will also be on that tour.",
    "You will meet her\nthere you will encounter her casually and thus it will be seen clearly\nto be a casual meeting.",
    "I was to choose my own time and moment to make myself known to\nyou if I thought that that would be the better way.",
    "You have already\nasked me if I or my friend the Governor had any reason to suspect or\nknow of any other person who might have been guilty of the murder.",
    "My friend the Governor certainly suggested nothing of the kind and he\nhad already taken up the matter with the police officer who had been\nin charge of the case.",
    "A most reliable detectivesuperintendent with\nvery good experience in these matters.",
    "No other man was suggested No other friend of the girls No other\nformer friend who might have been supplanted\n\n\fThere was nothing of that kind to find.",
    "I asked him to tell me a little\nabout you.",
    "He did not however consent to do so.",
    "He told me you were\nelderly.",
    "He told me that you were a person who knew about people.",
    "He\ntold me one other thing.",
    "He paused.",
    "Whats the other thing said Miss Marple.",
    "I have some natural\ncuriosity you know.",
    "I really cant think of any other advantage I\nconceivably could have.",
    "I am slightly deaf.",
    "My eyesight is not quite as\ngood as it used to be.",
    "I cannot really think that I have any advantages\nbeyond the fact that I may I suppose seem rather foolish and simple\nand am in fact what used to be called in rather earlier days an old\npussy.",
    "I am an old pussy.",
    "Is that the sort of thing he said\n\nNo said Professor Wanstead.",
    "What he said was he thought you had\na very fine sense of evil.",
    "Oh said Miss Marple.",
    "She was taken aback.",
    "Professor Wanstead was watching her.",
    "Would you say that was true he said.",
    "Miss Marple was quiet for quite a long time.",
    "At last she said Perhaps\nit is.",
    "Yes perhaps.",
    "I have at several different times in my life been\napprehensive\n\nhave\n\nrecognised\n\nthat\n\nthere\n\nwas\n\nevil\n\nin\n\nthe\n\nneighbourhood the surroundings that the environment of someone\nwho was evil was near me connected with what was happening.",
    "She looked at him suddenly and smiled.",
    "Its rather you know she said like being born with a very keen\nsense of smell.",
    "You can smell a leak of gas when other people cant do\nso.",
    "You can distinguish one perfume from another very easily.",
    "I had an\naunt once continued Miss Marple thoughtfully who said she could\nsmell when people told a lie.",
    "She said there was quite a distinctive\nodour came to her.",
    "Their noses twitched she said and then the smell\ncame.",
    "I dont know if it was true or not but well on several occasions\nshe was quite remarkable.",
    "She said to my uncle once Dont Jack\nengage that young man you were talking to this morning.",
    "He was\ntelling you lies the whole time he was talking.",
    "That turned out to be\nquite true.",
    "A sense of evil said Professor Wanstead.",
    "Well if you do sense evil\ntell me.",
    "I shall be glad to know.",
    "I dont think I have a particular sense of\nevil myself.",
    "Illhealth yes but not  not evil up here.",
    "He tapped his\nforehead.",
    "Id better tell you briefly how I came into things now said Miss\nMarple.",
    "Mr Rafiel as you know died.",
    "His lawyers asked me to come\nand see them apprised me of his proposition.",
    "I received a letter from\nhim which explained nothing.",
    "After that I heard nothing more for some\nlittle time.",
    "Then I got a letter from the company who run these tours\nsaying that Mr Rafiel before his death had made a reservation for me\nknowing that I should enjoy a trip very much and wanting to give it me\nas a surprise present.",
    "I was very astonished but took it as an indication\nof the first step that I was to undertake.",
    "I was to go on this tour and\npresumably in the course of the tour some other indication or hint or\nclue or direction would come to me.",
    "I think it did.",
    "Yesterday no the\nday before I was received on my arrival here by three ladies who live\nat an old manor house here and who very kindly extended an invitation\n\n\fto me.",
    "They had heard from Mr Rafiel they said who had written some\ntime before his death saying that a very old friend of his would be\ncoming on this tour and would they be kind enough to put her up for\ntwo or three days as he thought she was not fit to attempt the\nparticular ascent of this rather difficult climb up the headland to where\nthere was a memorial tower which was the principal event of\nyesterdays tour.",
    "And you took that also as an indication of what you were to do\n\nOf course said Miss Marple.",
    "There can be no other reason for it.",
    "He\nwas not a man to shower benefits for nothing out of compassion for an\nold lady who wasnt good at walking up hills.",
    "No.",
    "He wanted me to go\nthere.",
    "And you went there And what then\n\nNothing said Miss Marple.",
    "Three sisters.",
    "Three weird sisters\n\nThey ought to have been said Miss Marple but I dont think they\nwere.",
    "They didnt seem to be anyway.",
    "I dont know yet.",
    "I suppose they\nmay have been  they may be I mean.",
    "They seem ordinary enough.",
    "They didnt belong to this house.",
    "It had belonged to an uncle of theirs\nand theyd come here to live some years ago.",
    "They are in rather poor\ncircumstances they are amiable not particularly interesting.",
    "All\nslightly different in type.",
    "They do not appear to have been well\nacquainted with Mr Rafiel.",
    "Any conversation I have had with them\nappears to yield nothing.",
    "So you learnt nothing during your stay\n\nI learnt the facts of the case youve just told me.",
    "Not from them.",
    "From\nan elderly servant who started her reminiscences dating back to the\ntime of the uncle.",
    "She knew of Mr Rafiel only as a name.",
    "But she was\neloquent on the theme of the murder it had all started with the visit\nhere of a son of Mr Rafiels who was a bad lot of how the girl had fallen\nin love with him and that hed strangled the girl and how sad and\ntragic and terrible it all was.",
    "With bells on as you might say said\nMiss Marple using a phrase of her youth.",
    "Plenty of exaggeration but\nit was a nasty story and she seemed to believe that the police view\nwas that this hadnt been his only murder \n\nIt didnt seem to you to connect up with the three weird sisters\n\nNo only that theyd been the guardians of the girl and had loved her\ndearly.",
    "No more than that.",
    "They might know something something about another man\n\nYes  thats what we want isnt it The other man  a man of brutality\nwho wouldnt hesitate to bash in a girls head after hed killed her.",
    "The\nkind of man who could be driven frantic with jealousy.",
    "There are men\nlike that.",
    "No other curious things happened at The Old Manor\n\nNot really.",
    "One of the sisters the youngest I think kept talking about\nthe garden.",
    "She sounded as though she was a very keen gardener but\n\n\fshe couldnt be because she didnt know the names of half the things.",
    "I\nlaid a trap or two for her mentioning special rare shrubs and saying\ndid she know it and yes she said wasnt it a wonderful plant I said it\nwas not very hardy and she agreed.",
    "But she didnt know anything\nabout plants.",
    "That reminds me \n\nReminds you of what\n\nWell youll think Im just silly about gardens and plants but I mean\none does know things about them.",
    "I mean I know a few things about\nbirds and I know some things about gardens.",
    "And I gather that its not birds but gardens that are troubling you.",
    "Yes.",
    "Have you noticed two middleaged women on this tour Miss\nBarrow and Miss Cooke.",
    "Yes.",
    "Ive noticed them.",
    "Pair of middleaged spinsters travelling\ntogether.",
    "Thats right.",
    "Well Ive found out something odd about Miss Cooke.",
    "That is her name isnt it I mean its her name on the tour.",
    "Why has she got another name\n\nI think so.",
    "Shes the same person who visited me  I wont say visited\nme exactly but she was outside my garden fence in St Mary Mead the\nvillage where I live.",
    "She expressed pleasure at my garden and talked\nabout gardening with me.",
    "Told me she was living in the village and\nworking in somebodys garden whod moved into a new house there.",
    "I\n\n\frather think said Miss Marple yes I rather think that the whole thing\nwas lies.",
    "There again she knew nothing about gardening.",
    "She\npretended to but it wasnt true.",
    "Why do you think she came there\n\nId no idea at the time.",
    "She said her name was Bartlett.",
    "and the name\nof the woman she said she was living with began with H though I\ncant remember it for the moment.",
    "Her hair was not only differently\ndone but it was a different colour and her clothes were of a different\nstyle.",
    "I didnt recognise her at first on this trip.",
    "Just wondered why her\nface was vaguely familiar.",
    "And then suddenly it came to me.",
    "Because\nof the dyed hair.",
    "I said where I had seen her before.",
    "She admitted that\nshed been there but pretended that she too hadnt recognised me.",
    "All lies.",
    "And whats your opinion about all that\n\nWell one thing certainly... Miss Cooke to give her her present name\ncame to St Mary Mead just to have a look at me so that shed be quite\nsure to be able to recognise me when we met again \n\nAnd why was that felt to be necessary\n\nI dont know.",
    "There are two possibilities.",
    "Im not sure that I like one of\nthem very much.",
    "I dont know said Professor Wanstead that I like it very much\neither.",
    "They were both silent for a minute or two and then Professor\nWanstead said.",
    "I dont like what happened to Elizabeth Temple.",
    "Youve talked to her\nduring this trip\n\nYes I have.",
    "When shes better Id like to talk to her again  she could\ntell me us  things about the girl who was murdered.",
    "She spoke to me\nof this girl who had been at her school who had been going to marry\nMr Rafiels son  but didnt marry him.",
    "Instead she died.",
    "I asked how or\nwhy she died  and she answered with the word Love.",
    "I took it as\nmeaning a suicide  but it was murder.",
    "Murder through jealousy would\nfit.",
    "Another man.",
    "Some other man weve got to find.",
    "Miss Temple may\nbe able to tell us who he was.",
    "No other sinister possibilities\n\nI think really it is casual information we need.",
    "I see no reason to\nbelieve that there is any sinister suggestion in any of the coach\npassengers  or any sinister suggestion about the people living in The\nOld Manor House.",
    "But one of those three sisters may have known or\nremembered something that the girl or Michael once said.",
    "Clotilde\nused to take the girl abroad.",
    "Therefore she may know of something\nthat occurred on some foreign trip perhaps.",
    "Something that the girl\nsaid or mentioned or did on some trip.",
    "Some man that the girl met.",
    "Something which has nothing to do with The Old Manor House here.",
    "It\nis difficult because only by talking by casual information can you get\nany clue.",
    "The second sister Mrs Glynne married fairly early has spent\ntime I gather in India and in Africa.",
    "She may have heard of something\nthrough her husband or through her husbands relations through\n\n\fvarious things that are unconnected with The Old Manor House here\nalthough she has visited it from time to time.",
    "She knew the murdered\ngirl presumably but I should think she knew her much less well than\nthe other two.",
    "But that does not mean that she may not know some\nsignificant facts about the girl.",
    "The third sister is more scatty more\nlocalised does not seem to have known the girl as well.",
    "But still she\ntoo may have information about possible lovers  or boyfriends  seen\nthe girl with an unknown man.",
    "Thats her by the way passing the hotel\nnow.",
    "Miss\n\nMarple\n\nhowever\n\noccupied\n\nby\n\nher\n\nt\u00eate\u00e0t\u00eate\n\nhad\n\nnot\n\nrelinquished the habits of a lifetime.",
    "A public thoroughfare was always\nto her an observation post.",
    "All the passersby either loitering or\nhurrying had been noticed automatically.",
    "Anthea BradburyScott the one with the big parcel.",
    "Shes going to the\npost office I suppose.",
    "Its just round the corner isnt it\n\nLooks a bit daft to me said Professor Wanstead all that floating\nhair  grey hair too  a kind of Ophelia of fifty.",
    "I thought of Ophelia too when I first saw her.",
    "Oh dear I wish I knew\nwhat I ought to do next.",
    "Stay here at the Golden Boar for a day or two\nor go on with the coach tour.",
    "Its like looking for a needle in a haystack.",
    "If you stick your fingers in it long enough you ought to come up with\nsomething  even if one does get pricked in the process.",
    "Chapter 13\n\n\fBLACK AND RED CHECK\n\nMrs Sandbourne returned just as the party was sitting down to lunch.",
    "Her news was not good.",
    "Miss Temple was still unconscious.",
    "She\ncertainly could not be moved for several days.",
    "Having given the bulletin Mrs Sandbourne turned the conversation to\npractical matters.",
    "She produced suitable time tables of trains for those\nwho wished to return to London and proposed suitable plans for the\nresumption of the tour on the morrow or the next day.",
    "She had a list of\nsuitable short expeditions in the near neighbourhood for this\nafternoon small groups in hired cars.",
    "Professor Wanstead drew Miss Marple aside as they went out of the\ndining room \n\nYou may want to rest this afternoon.",
    "If not I will call for you here in an\nhours time.",
    "There is an interesting church you might care to see\n\nThat would be very nice said Miss Marple.",
    "II\n\n\fMiss Marple sat quite still in the car that had come to fetch her.",
    "Professor Wanstead had called for her at the time he had said.",
    "I thought you might enjoy seeing this particular church.",
    "And a very\npretty village too he explained.",
    "Theres no reason really why one\nshould not enjoy the local sights when one can.",
    "Its very kind of you Im sure Miss Marple had said.",
    "She had looked at him with that slightly fluttery gaze of hers.",
    "Very kind she said.",
    "It just seems  well I dont want to say it seems\nheartless but well you know what I mean.",
    "My dear lady Miss Temple is not an old friend of yours or anything like\nthat.",
    "Sad as this accident has been.",
    "Well said Miss Marple again this is very kind of you.",
    "Professor Wanstead had opened the door of the car and Miss Marple\ngot into it.",
    "It was she presumed a hired car.",
    "A kindly thought to take an elderly\nlady to see one of the sights of the neighbourhood.",
    "He might have taken somebody younger more interesting and\ncertainly better looking.",
    "Miss Marple looked at him thoughtfully once\nor twice as they drove through the village.",
    "He was not looking at her.",
    "He was gazing out of his own window.",
    "When they had left the village behind and were on a second class\ncountry road twisting round the hillside he turned his head and said to\nher We are not going to a church I am afraid.",
    "No said Miss Marple I thought perhaps we werent.",
    "Yes the idea would have come to you.",
    "Where are we going may I ask\n\nWe are going to a hospital in Carristown.",
    "Ah yes that was where Miss Temple was taken\n\nIt was a question though it hardly needed to be one.",
    "Yes he said.",
    "Mrs Sandbourne saw her and brought me back a letter\nfrom the Hospital Authorities.",
    "I have just finished talking to them on the\ntelephone.",
    "Is she going on well\n\nNo.",
    "Not going on very well.",
    "I see.",
    "At least  I hope I dont see said Miss Marple.",
    "Her recovery is very problematical but there is nothing that can be\ndone.",
    "She may not recover consciousness again.",
    "On the other hand\nshe may have a few lucid intervals.",
    "And you are taking me there Why I am not a friend of hers you\nknow.",
    "I only just met her for the first time on this trip.",
    "Yes I realise that.",
    "Im taking you there because in one of the lucid\nintervals she has had she asked for you.",
    "I see said Miss Marple.",
    "I wonder why she should ask for me why\nshe should have thought that I  that I could be useful in any way to her\nor do anything.",
    "She is a woman of perception.",
    "In her way you know a\ngreat woman.",
    "As Headmistress of Fallowfield she occupied a\nprominent position in the educational world.",
    "The best girls school there is I suppose\n\nYes.",
    "She was a great personality.",
    "She was herself a woman of\nconsiderable scholarship.",
    "Mathematics were her speciality but she\nwas an all round what I should call an educator.",
    "Was interested in\neducation what girls were fitted for how to encourage them.",
    "Oh\nmany other things.",
    "It is sad and very cruel if she dies said Miss\nMarple.",
    "It will seem such a waste of a life.",
    "Although she had retired\nfrom her Headmistressship she still exercised a lot of power.",
    "This\naccident  she stopped.",
    "Perhaps you do not want us to discuss the\naccident\n\nI think it is better that we should do so.",
    "A big boulder crashed down\nthe hillside.",
    "It has been known to happen before though only at very\nlong divided intervals of time.",
    "However somebody came and spoke to\nme about it said Professor Wanstead.",
    "Came and spoke to you about the accident Who was it\n\n\fThe two young people.",
    "Joanna Crawford and Emlyn Price.",
    "What did they say\n\nJoanna told me that she had the impression there was someone on\nthe hillside.",
    "Rather high up.",
    "She and Emlyn were climbing up from the\nlower main path following a rough track that wound round the curve of\nthe hill.",
    "As they turned a corner she definitely saw outlined against the\nskyline a man or a woman who was trying to roll a big boulder forward\nalong the ground.",
    "The boulder was rocking  and finally it started to\nroll at first slowly and then gathering speed down the hillside.",
    "Miss\nTemple was walking along the main path below and had come to a\npoint just underneath it when the boulder hit her.",
    "If it was done\ndeliberately it might not of course have succeeded it might have\nmissed her but it did succeed.",
    "If what was being attempted was a\ndeliberate attack on the woman walking below it succeeded only too\nwell.",
    "Was it a man or a woman they saw asked Miss Marple.",
    "Unfortunately Joanna Crawford could not say.",
    "Whoever it was was\nwearing jeans or trousers and had on a lurid poloneck pullover in red\nand black checks.",
    "The figure turned and moved out of sight almost\nimmediately.",
    "She is inclined to think it was a man but cannot be\ncertain.",
    "And she thinks or you think that it was a deliberate attempt on Miss\nTemples life\n\n\fThe more she mulls it over the more she thinks that that was exactly\nwhat it was.",
    "The boy agrees.",
    "You have no idea who it might have been\n\nNo idea whatever.",
    "No more have they.",
    "It might be one of our fellow\ntravellers someone who went for a stroll that afternoon.",
    "It might be\nsomeone completely unknown who knew that the coach was making a\nhalt here and chose this place to make an attack on one of the\npassengers.",
    "Some youthful lover of violence for violences sake.",
    "Or it\nmight have been an enemy.",
    "It seems very melodramatic if one says a secret enemy said Miss\nMarple.",
    "Yes it does.",
    "Who would want to kill a retired and respected\nHeadmistress That is a question we want answered.",
    "It is possible\nfaintly possible that Miss Temple herself might be able to tell us.",
    "She\nmight have recognised the figure above her or she might more likely\nhave known of someone who bore her illwill for some special reason.",
    "It still seems unlikely.",
    "I agree with you said Professor Wanstead.",
    "She seems a totally\nunlikely person to be a fit victim of attack but yet when one reflects a\nHeadmistress knows a great many people.",
    "A great many people shall\nwe put it this way have passed through her hands.",
    "A lot of girls you mean have passed through her hands.",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes that is what I meant.",
    "Girls and their families.",
    "A\nHeadmistress must have knowledge of many things.",
    "Romances for\ninstance that girls might indulge in unknown to their parents.",
    "It\nhappens you know.",
    "It happens very often.",
    "Especially in the last ten or\ntwenty years.",
    "Girls are said to mature earlier.",
    "That is physically true\nthough in a deeper sense of the word they mature late.",
    "They remain\nchildish longer.",
    "Childish in the clothes they like to wear childish with\ntheir floating hair.",
    "Even their miniskirts represent a worship of\nchildishness.",
    "Their Baby Doll nightdresses their gymslips and shorts\nall childrens fashions.",
    "They wish not to become adult not to have to\naccept our kind of responsibility.",
    "And yet like all children they want to\nbe thought grown up and free to do what they think are grown up\nthings.",
    "And that leads sometimes to tragedy and sometimes to the\naftermath of tragedy.",
    "Are you thinking of some particular case\n\nNo.",
    "No not really.",
    "Im only thinking well shall we say letting\npossibilities pass through my mind.",
    "I cannot believe that Elizabeth\nTemple had a personal enemy.",
    "An enemy ruthless enough to wish to\ntake an opportunity of killing her.",
    "What I do think he looked at Mrs\nMarple would you like to make a suggestion\n\nOf a possibility Well I think I know or guess what you are\nsuggesting.",
    "You are suggesting that Miss Temple knew something\nknew some fact or had some knowledge that would be inconvenient or\neven dangerous to somebody if it was known.",
    "Yes I do feel exactly that.",
    "In that case said.",
    "Miss Marple it seems indicated that there is\nsomeone on our coach tour who recognised Miss Temple or knew who\nshe was but who perhaps after the passage of some years was not\nremembered or might even not have been recognised by Miss Temple.",
    "It seems to throw it back on our passengers does it not She paused.",
    "That pullover you mentioned  red and black checks you said\n\nOh yes The pullover  He looked at her curiously.",
    "What was it that\nstruck you about that\n\nIt was very noticeable said Miss Marple.",
    "That is what your words\nled me to infer.",
    "It was very mentionable.",
    "So much so that the girl\nJoanna mentioned it specifically.",
    "Yes.",
    "And what does that suggest to you\n\nThe trailing of flags said Miss Marple thoughtfully.",
    "Something that\nwill be seen remembered observed recognised.",
    "Yes.",
    "Professor Wanstead looked at her with encouragement.",
    "When you describe a person you have seen seen not close at hand\nbut from a distance the first thing you will describe will be their\nclothes.",
    "Not their faces not their walk not their hands not their feet.",
    "A scarlet tamoshanter a purple anorak a bizzarre leather jacket a\npullover of brilliant reds and blacks.",
    "Something very recognisable\nvery noticeable.",
    "The object of it being that when that person removes\nthat garment gets rid of it sends it by post in a parcel to some\naddress say about a hundred miles away or thrusts it in a rubbish bin\nin a city or burns it or tars it up or destroys it she or he will be the one\n\n\fperson modestly and rather drably atired who will not be suspected or\nlooked at or thought of.",
    "It must have been meant that scarlet and\nblack check jersey.",
    "Meant so that it will be recognised again later\nthough actually it will never again be seen on that particular person.",
    "A very sound idea said Professor Wanstead.",
    "As I have told you\ncontinued the Professor Fallowfield is situated not very far from\nhere.",
    "Sixteen miles I think.",
    "This is Elizabeth Temples part of the\nworld a part she knows well with people in it that she also might know\nwell.",
    "Yes.",
    "It widens the possibilities said Miss Marple.",
    "I agree with you\nshe said presently that the attacker is more likely to have been a man\nthan a woman.",
    "That boulder if it was done with intent was sent on its\ncourse very accurately.",
    "Accuracy is more a male quality than a female\none.",
    "On the other hand there might easily have been someone on our\ncoach or possibly in the neighbourhood who saw Miss Temple in the\nstreet a former pupil of hers in past years.",
    "Someone whom she herself\nmight not recognise after a period of time.",
    "But the girl or woman would\nhave recognised her because a Headmaster or Headmistress of over\nsixty is not unlike the same Headmaster or Headmistress at the age of\nfifty.",
    "She is recognisable.",
    "Some woman who recognised her former\nmistress and also knew that her mistress knew something damaging\nabout her.",
    "Someone who might in some way prove a danger to her.",
    "She sighed.",
    "I myself do not know this part of the world at all.",
    "Have you\nany particular knowledge of it\n\nNo said Professor Wanstead.",
    "I could not claim a personal\nknowledge of this part of the country.",
    "I know something however of\n\n\fvarious things that have happened in this part of the world entirely\nbecause of what you have told me.",
    "If it had not been for my\nacquaintanceship with you and the things you have told me I could\nhave been more at sea than I am.",
    "What are you yourself actually doing here You do not know.",
    "Yet you\nwere sent here.",
    "It was deliberately arranged by Rafiel that you should\ncome here that you should take this coach tour that you and I should\nmeet.",
    "There have been other places where we have stopped or\nthrough which we have passed but special arrangements here were\nmade so that you should actually stay for a couple of nights here.",
    "You\nwere put up with former friends of his who would not have refused any\nrequest he made.",
    "Was there a reason for that\n\nSo that I could learn certain facts that I had to know said Miss\nMarple.",
    "A series of murders that took place a good many years ago\nProfessor Wanstead looked doubtful.",
    "There is nothing unusual in that.",
    "You can say the same of many places in England and Wales.",
    "These\nthings seem always to go in a series.",
    "First a girl found assaulted and\nmurdered.",
    "Then another girl not very far away.",
    "Then something of the\nsame kind perhaps twenty miles away.",
    "The same pattern of death.",
    "Two girls were reported missing from Jocelyn St Mary itself the one\nthat we have been discussing whose body was found six months later\nmany miles away and who was last seen in the company of Michael\nRafiel...\n\nAnd the other\n\n\fA girl called Nora Broad.",
    "Not a quiet girl with no boyfriends.",
    "Possibly\nwith one boyfriend too many.",
    "Her body was never found.",
    "It will be one\nday.",
    "There have been cases when twenty years have passed said\nWanstead.",
    "He slowed down We have arrived.",
    "This is Carristown and\nhere is the Hospital.",
    "Shepherded by Professor Wanstead Miss Marple entered.",
    "The\nProfessor was obviously expected.",
    "He was ushered into a small room\nwhere a woman rose from a desk.",
    "Oh yes she said Professor Wanstead.",
    "And er this is er  She\nhesitated slightly.",
    "Miss Jane Marple said Professor Wanstead.",
    "I talked to Sister\nBarker on the telephone.",
    "Oh yes.",
    "Sister Barker said that she would be accompanying you.",
    "How is Miss Temple\n\nMuch the same I think.",
    "I am afraid there is not much improvement to\nreport.",
    "She rose.",
    "I will take you to Sister Barker.",
    "Sister Barker was a tall thin woman.",
    "She had a low decisive voice and\ndark grey eyes that had a habit of looking at you and looking away\n\n\falmost immediately leaving you with the feeling that you had been\ninspected in a very short space of time and judgement pronounced\nupon you.",
    "I dont know what arrangements you have in mind said Professor\nWanstead.",
    "Well I had better tell Miss Marple just what we have arranged.",
    "First I\nmust make it clear to you that the patient Miss Temple is still in a\ncoma with very rare intervals.",
    "She appears to come to occasionally to\nrecognise her surroundings and to be able to say a few words.",
    "But\nthere is nothing one can do to stimulate her.",
    "It has to be left to the\nutmost patience.",
    "I expect Professor Wanstead has already told you\nthat in one of her intervals of consciousness she uttered quite\ndistinctly the words Miss Jane Marple.",
    "And then I want to speak to\nher.",
    "Miss Jane Marple.",
    "After that she relapsed into unconsciousness.",
    "Doctor thought it advisable to get in touch with the other occupants of\nthe coach.",
    "Professor Wanstead came to see us and explained various\nmatters and said he would bring you over.",
    "I am afraid that all we can\nask you to do is to sit in the private ward where Miss Temple is and\nperhaps be ready to make a note of any words she should say if she\ndoes regain consciousness.",
    "I am afraid the prognosis is not very\nhelpful.",
    "To be quite frank which is better I think since you are not a\nnear relative and are unlikely to be disturbed by this information\nDoctor thinks that she is sinking fast that she may die without\nrecovering consciousness.",
    "There is nothing one can do to relieve the\nconcussion.",
    "It is important that someone should hear what she says\nand Doctor thinks it advisable that she should not see too many people\nround her if she regains consciousness.",
    "If Miss Marple is not worried\nat the thought of sitting there alone there will be a nurse in the room\n\n\fthough not obviously so.",
    "That is she will not be noticed from the bed\nand will not move unless shes asked for.",
    "She will sit in a corner of the\nroom shielded by a screen.",
    "She added We have a police official there also ready to take down\nanything.",
    "The Doctor thinks it advisable that he also should not be\nnoticed by Miss Temple.",
    "One person alone and that possibly a person\nshe expects to see will not alarm her or make her lose knowledge of\nwhat she wants to say to you.",
    "I hope this will not be too difficult a thing\nto ask you\n\nOh no said Miss Marple Im quite prepared to do that.",
    "I have a\nsmall notebook with me and a pen that will not be in evidence.",
    "I can\nremember things by heart for a very short time so I need not appear to\nbe obviously taking notes of what she says.",
    "You can trust my memory\nand I am not deaf  not deaf in the real sense of the word.",
    "I dont think\nmy hearing is quite as good as it used to be but if I am sitting near a\nbedside I ought to be able to hear any thing she says quite easily even\nif it is whispered.",
    "I am used to sick people.",
    "I have had a good deal to do\nwith them in my time.",
    "Again the lightning glance of Sister Barker went over Miss Marple.",
    "This\ntime a faint inclination of the head showed satisfaction.",
    "It is kind of you she said and I am sure that if there is any help you\ncan give we can rely on you to give it.",
    "If Professor Wanstead likes to\nsit in the waiting room downstairs we can call him at any moment if it\nshould be necessary.",
    "Now Miss Marple perhaps you will accompany\nme.",
    "Miss Marple followed Sister along a passage and into a small well\nappointed single room.",
    "In the bed there in a dimlylighted room since\nthe blinds were half drawn lay Elizabeth Temple.",
    "She lay there like a\nstatue yet she did not give the impression of being asleep.",
    "Her breath\ncame uncertainly in slight gasps.",
    "Sister Barker bent to examine her\npatient motioned Miss Marple into a chair beside the bed.",
    "She then\ncrossed the room to the door again.",
    "A young man with a notebook in\nhis hand came from behind the screen there.",
    "Doctors orders Mr Reckitt said Sister Barker.",
    "A nurse also appeared.",
    "She had been sitting in the opposite corner of\nthe room.",
    "Call me if necessary Nurse Edmonds said Sister Barker and get\nMiss Marple anything she may need.",
    "Miss Marple loosened her coat.",
    "The room was warm.",
    "The nurse\napproached and took it from her.",
    "Then she retired to her former\nposition Miss Marple sat down in the chair.",
    "She looked at Elizabeth\nTemple thinking as she had thought before when looking at her in the\ncoach what a fine shaped head she had.",
    "Her grey hair drawn back\nfrom it fitted her face in a perfect caplike effect.",
    "A handsome woman\nand a woman of personality.",
    "Yes a thousand pities Miss Marple\nthought a thousand pities if the world was going to lose Elizabeth\nTemple.",
    "Miss Marple eased the cushion at her back moved the chair a fraction\nof an inch and sat quietly to wait.",
    "Whether to wait in vain or to some\npoint she had no idea.",
    "Time passed.",
    "Ten minutes twenty minutes half\n\n\fan hour thirtyfive minutes.",
    "Then suddenly quite unexpectedly as it\nwere a voice came.",
    "Low but distinct slightly husky.",
    "None of the\nresonance it had once held.",
    "Miss Marple.",
    "Elizabeth Temples eyes were open now.",
    "They were looking at Miss\nMarple.",
    "They looked competent perfectly sensible.",
    "She was studying\nthe face of the woman who was sitting by her bed studying her without\nany sign of emotion of surprise.",
    "Only one would say of scrutiny.",
    "Fully\nconscious scrutiny.",
    "And the voice spoke again.",
    "Miss Marple.",
    "You are Jane Marple\n\nThat is right.",
    "Yes said Miss Marple Jane Marple.",
    "Henry often spoke of you.",
    "He said things about you.",
    "The voice stopped.",
    "Miss Marple said with a slight query in her voice\nHenry\n\nHenry Clithering an old friend of mine  very old friend.",
    "An old friend of mine too said Miss Marple.",
    "Henry Clithering.",
    "Her mind went back to the many years she had known him Sir Henry\nClithering the things he had said to her the assistance he had asked\nfrom her sometimes and the assistance that she had asked from him.",
    "A very old friend.",
    "I remembered your name.",
    "On the passenger list.",
    "I thought it must be\nyou.",
    "You could help.",
    "Thats what he  Henry yes  would say if he were\n\n\fhere.",
    "You might be able to help.",
    "To find out.",
    "Its important.",
    "Very\nimportant although its a long time ago now  a long time ago.",
    "Her voice faltered a little her eyes half closed.",
    "Nurse got up came\nacross the room picked up a small glass and held it to Elizabeth\nTemples lips.",
    "Miss Temple took a sip nodded her head dismissively.",
    "Nurse put down the glass and went back to her chair.",
    "If I can help I will said Miss Marple.",
    "She asked no further questions.",
    "Miss Temple said Good and after a minute or two again Good.",
    "For two or three minutes she lay with her eyes closed.",
    "She might have\nbeen asleep or unconscious.",
    "Then her eyes opened again suddenly.",
    "Which she said which of them Thats what one has got to know.",
    "Do you know what I am talking about\n\nI think so.",
    "A girl who died... Nora Broad A frown came quickly to\nElizabeth Temples forehead.",
    "No no no.",
    "The other girl.",
    "Verity Hunt.",
    "There was a pause and then Jane Marple.",
    "Youre old older than when\nhe talked about you.",
    "Youre older but you can still find out things cant\nyou\n\nHer voice became slightly higher more insistent.",
    "You can cant you Say you can.",
    "Ive not much time.",
    "I know that.",
    "I\nknow it quite well.",
    "One of them but which Find out.",
    "Henry would have\nsaid you can.",
    "It may be dangerous for you but youll find out wont\nyou\n\nWith Gods help I will said Miss Marple.",
    "It was a vow.",
    "The eyes closed then opened again.",
    "Something like a smile seemed to\ntry and twitch the lips.",
    "The big stone from above.",
    "The Stone of Death.",
    "Who rolled that stone down\n\nDont know.",
    "No matter  only Verity.",
    "Find out about Verity.",
    "Truth.",
    "Another name for truth Verity.",
    "Miss Marple saw the faint relaxation of the body on the bed.",
    "There was\na faintly whispered Goodbye.",
    "Do your best...",
    "Her body relaxed the eyes closed.",
    "The nurse came again to the\nbedside.",
    "This time she took up the pulse felt it and beckoned to Miss\nMarple.",
    "Miss Marple rose obediently and followed her out of the room.",
    "Thats been a big effort for her said the nurse.",
    "She wont regain\nconsciousness again for some time.",
    "Perhaps not at all.",
    "I hope you\nlearnt something\n\nI dont think I did said Miss Marple but one never knows does\none.",
    "Did you get anything asked Professor Wanstead as they went out\nto the car.",
    "A name said Miss Marple.",

    "Been there a long time\ntoo.",
    "Yes said Mr Schuster somewhat uninterested.",
    "He wondered why\nBroadribb was so interested in defunct schoolmistresses.",
    "Schools were not really of particular interest to either of the two\ngentlemen.",
    "Their own offspring were now more or less disposed of.",
    "Mr\nBroadribbs two sons were respectively in the Civil Service and in an\noil firm and Mr Schusters rather younger progeny were at different\nuniversities where both of them respectively were making as much\ntrouble for those in authority as they possibly could do.",

    "Then as I say mum tells the girl to call it rape.",
    "However thats not the point said Mr Broadribb.",

    "I thought this Jane Marple\nbusiness with Rafiel might have something to do with Michael.",
    "Found guilty wasnt he And given a life sentence\n\nI cant remember now its so long ago.",

    "A lot of his\nfriends gave him an alibi that didnt stand up if you know what I mean.",
    "All his friends seemed to be fluent liars.",
    "Whats your feeling about it Broadribb\n\nOh I havent got any feelings said Mr Broadribb I was just\nwondering if this womans death might tie up.",

    "The vicar had been\napproached and had agreed to hold a brief memorial service in the\nchurch as soon as arrangements could be made.",

    "To leave what\nwould become a journey of painful memories or to continue with the\n\n\fsightseeing that had already been paid for and which had been\ninterrupted only by one of those painful accidents that may happen on\nany sightseeing expedition.",
    "A lot would depend Miss Marple thought\non the outcome of the inquest.",
    "Miss Marple after exchanging various conventional remarks proper to\nthe occasion with her three hostesses had devoted herself to her\npurple wool and had sat considering her next line of investigation.",

    "Throwing it as one throws a pebble into a stream solely to observe\nwhat the result if any would be.",
    "Would it mean something to her\nhostesses It might or it might not.",
    "Otherwise when she joined the\nmembers of the tour at their hotel meal this evening which had been\narranged she would try the effect of it there.",
    "It had been she thought\nto herself the last word or almost the last word that Elizabeth Temple\nhad spoken.",
    "So therefore thought Miss Marple her fingers still busy\nbecause she did not need to look at her crocheting she could read a\nbook or conduct a conversation while her fingers though slightly\ncrippled with rheumatism would proceed correctly through their\nappointed movements.",
    "So therefore Verity.",

    "It is Verity\nHunt you mean\n\nLavinia Glynne said Its a Christian name.",
    "I never knew anyone of that name said Miss Marple but I did mean\na Christian name.",
    "Yes.",
    "It is rather unusual I think.",
    "Verity.",
    "She\nrepeated it thoughtfully.",
    "She let her purple wool ball fall and looked round with the slightly\napologetic and embarrassed look of one who realises she has made a\nserious faux pas but not sure why.",
    "I  I am so sorry.",
    "Have I said something I shouldnt It was only\nbecause...\n\nNo of course not said Mrs Glynne.",
    "It was just that it is it is a name\nwe know a name with which we have associations.",

    "I went to see\nher you know yesterday afternoon.",
    "Professor Wanstead took me.",
    "He\nseemed to think that I might be able to to I dont know if its the proper\nword to rouse her in some way.",
    "She was in a coma and they thought\nnot that I was a friend of hers at any time but we had chatted together\non the tour and we often sat beside each other as you know on some\nof the days and we had talked.",
    "And he thought perhaps I might be of\nsome use.",
    "Im afraid I wasnt though.",
    "Not at all.",
    "I just sat there and\nwaited and then she did say one or two words but they didnt seem to\nmean anything.",
    "But finally just when it was time for me to go she did\nopen her eyes and looked at me.",
    "I dont know if she was mistaking me\nfor someone but she did say that word.",
    "Verity And well of course it\nstuck in my mind especially with her passing away yesterday evening.",
    "It must have been someone or something that she had in her mind.",
    "But\nof course it might just mean  well of course it might just mean Truth.",
    "Thats what verity means doesnt it\n\nShe looked from Clotilde to Lavinia to Anthea.",
    "It was the Christian name of a girl we knew said Lavinia Glynne.",
    "That is why it startled us.",
    "Especially because of the awful way she died said Anthea.",

    "And I thought\nperhaps well hed mentioned the whole thing to you.",
    "Im so sorry said Miss Marple Im afraid I dont quite understand\nwhat youre talking about.",
    "They found her body in a ditch said Anthea.",
    "There was never any holding Anthea Miss Marple thought not once\nshe got going.",
    "But she thought that Antheas vociferous talk was\nputting additional strain on Clotilde.",
    "She had taken out a handkerchief\nnow in a quiet noncommittal way.",
    "She brushed tears from her eyes\nand then sat upright her back very straight her eyes deep and tragic.",
    "Verity she said was a girl we cared for very much.",
    "She lived here\nfor a while.",

    "She turned her face away.",
    "I do you mind if we dont talk about it any more just now.",

    "He went\non What happened next\n\nWell the stone began to roll over.",
    "It sort of toppled over the edge and\nthen it began to gain speed.",
    "I said to Emlyn Oh its going to go right\nover down the hill.",
    "Then we heard a sort of crash as it fell.",
    "And I think I\nheard a cry from below but I might have imagined it.",

    "I was  I was busy looking at the\naccident and running down the hill to see if one could do anything.",
    "I\ndid just look up I think but there wasnt anyone in sight.",
    "Only the\nstones.",
    "There were a lot of contours and you could lose anyone quite\neasily from view.",
    "Could it have been one of your party\n\nOh no.",
    "Im sure it wasnt one of us.",
    "I would have known because I\nmean one would have known by their clothes.",
    "Im sure nobody was\nwearing a scarlet and black pullover.",
    "Thank you Miss Crawford.",
    "Emlyn Price was called next.",
    "His story was practically a replica of\nJoannas.",
    "There was a little more evidence which did not amount to much.",
    "The Coroner brought in that there was not sufficient evidence to show\nhow Elizabeth Temple had come to her death and adjourned the\ninquest for a fortnight.",
    "Chapter 17\n\n\fMISS MARPLE MAKES A VISIT\n\nWhile they walked back from the inquest to the Golden Boar hardly\nanyone spoke.",
    "Professor Wanstead walked beside Miss Marple and\nsince she was not a very fast walker they fell slightly behind the\nothers.",
    "What will happen next Miss Marple asked at last.",
    "Do you mean legally or to us\n\nI suppose both said Miss Marple because one will surely affect the\nother.",
    "It will be presumably a case of the police making further enquiries\narising out of the evidence given by those two young people.",
    "Yes.",
    "Further enquiry will be necessary.",
    "The inquest was bound to be\nadjourned.",
    "One can hardly expect the Coroner to give a verdict of\naccidental death.",
    "No I understand that.",
    "She said What did you think of their\nevidence\n\n\fProfessor Wanstead directed a sharp glance from under his beetling\neyebrows.",
    "Have you any ideas on the subject Miss Marple His voice was\nsuggestive.",
    "Of course said Professor Wanstead we knew beforehand what\nthey were going to say.",
    "Yes.",
    "What you mean is that you are asking what I thought about them\nthemselves their feelings about it.",
    "It was interesting said Miss Marple.",
    "Very interesting.",
    "The red and\nblack check pullover.",
    "Rather important I think dont you Rather\nstriking\n\nYes exactly that.",
    "He shot again that look at her under his eyebrows.",
    "What does it\nsuggest to you exactly\n\nI think said Miss Marple.",
    "I think the description of that might give us\na valuable clue.",
    "They came to the Golden Boar.",
    "It was only about half past twelve and\nMrs Sandbourne suggested a little refreshment before going into\nluncheon.",
    "As sherry and tomato juice and other liquors were being\n\n\fconsumed\n\nMrs\n\nSandbourne\n\nproceeded\n\nto\n\nmake\n\ncertain\n\nannouncements.",
    "I have taken advice she said both from the Coroner and Inspector\nDouglas.",
    "Since the medical evidence has been taken fully there will be\nat the church a funeral memorial service tomorrow at eleven oclock.",
    "Im going to make arrangements with Mr Courtney the local vicar\nabout it.",
    "On the following day it will be best I think to resume our tour.",
    "The programme will be slightly altered since we have lost three days\nbut I think it can be reorganised on rather simpler lines.",
    "I have heard\nfrom one or two members of our party that they would prefer to return\nto London presumably by rail.",
    "I can quite understand the feelings lying\nbehind this and would not like to try and influence you in any way.",
    "This\ndeath has been a very sad occurrence.",
    "I still cannot help but believe\nthat Miss Temples death was the result of an accident.",
    "Such a thing\nhas happened before on that particular pathway though there do not\nappear in this case to have been any geological or atmospherical\nconditions causing it.",
    "I think a good deal more investigation will have\nto be made.",
    "Of course some hiker on a walking tour  that kind of thing\n may have been pushing about boulders quite innocently not realising\nthat there was a danger for someone walking below in what he or she\nwas doing.",
    "If so if that person comes forward the whole thing may be\ncleared up quite quickly but I agree one cannot take that for granted\nat present.",
    "It seems unlikely that the late Miss Temple could have had\nany enemy or anyone who wished her harm of any kind.",
    "What I should\nsuggest is that we do not discuss the accident any further.",
    "Investigations will be made by the local authorities whose business it\nis.",
    "I think we will probably all like to attend the memorial service in the\nchurch tomorrow.",
    "And after that on continuing the tour I hope that it\nmay distract our minds from the shock we have had.",
    "There are still\n\n\fsome very interesting and famous houses to see and some very\nbeautiful scenery also.",
    "Luncheon being announced shortly after that the subject was not\ndiscussed any further.",
    "That is to say not openly.",
    "After lunch as they\ntook coffee in the lounge people were prone to get together in little\ngroups discussing their further arrangements.",
    "Are you continuing on the tour asked Professor Wanstead of Miss\nMarple.",
    "No said Miss Marple.",
    "She spoke thoughtfully.",
    "No.",
    "I think  I think\nthat what has happened inclines me to remain here a little longer.",
    "At the Golden Boar or at the Old Manor House\n\nThat rather depends as to whether I receive any further invitation to\ngo back to the Old Manor House.",
    "I would not like to suggest it myself\nbecause my original invitation was for the two nights that the tour was\nto have stayed here originally.",
    "I think possibly it would be better for me\nto remain at the Golden Boar.",
    "You dont feel like returning to St Mary Mead\n\nNot yet said Miss Marple.",
    "There are one or two things I could do\nhere I think.",
    "One thing I have done already.",
    "She met his enquiring\ngaze.",
    "If you are going on she said with the rest of the party I will\ntell you what I have put in hand and suggest a small sideline of\nenquiry that might be helpful.",
    "The other reason that I wish to stay here\nI will tell you later.",
    "There are certain enquiries  local enquiries  that I\n\n\fwant to make.",
    "They may not lead anywhere so I think it as well not to\nmention them now.",
    "And you\n\nI should like to return to London.",
    "I have work there waiting to be done.",
    "Unless that is I can be helpful to you here\n\nNo said Miss Marple I do not think so at present.",
    "I expect you have\nvarious enquiries of your own that you wish to put in hand.",
    "I came on the tour to meet you Miss Marple.",
    "And now you have met me and know what I know or practically all\nthat I know you have other enquiries to put in hand.",
    "I understand that.",
    "But before you leave here I think there are one or two things well that\nmight be helpful might give a result.",
    "I see.",
    "You have ideas.",
    "I am remembering what you said.",
    "You have perhaps pinned down the smell of evil\n\nIt is difficult said Miss Marple to know exactly what something\nwrong in the atmosphere really means.",
    "But you do feel that there is something wrong in the atmosphere\n\nOh yes.",
    "Very clearly.",
    "And especially since Miss Temples death which of course was not\nan accident no matter what Mrs Sandbourne hopes.",
    "No said Miss Marple it was not an accident.",
    "What I dont think I\nhave told you is that Miss Temple said to me once that she was on a\npilgrimage.",
    "Interesting said the Professor.",
    "Yes interesting.",
    "She didnt tell you\nwhat the pilgrimage was to where or to whom\n\nNo said Miss Marple if shed lived just a little longer and not been\nso weak she might have told me.",
    "But unfortunately death came a little\ntoo soon.",
    "So that you have not any further ideas on that subject.",
    "No.",
    "Only a feeling of assurance that her pilgrimage was put an end to\nby malign design.",
    "Someone wanted to stop her going wherever she\nwas going or stop her going to whomever she was going to.",
    "One can\nonly hope that chance or Providence may throw light on that.",
    "Thats why youre staying here\n\nNot only that said Miss Marple.",
    "I want to find out something more\nabout a girl called Nora Broad.",
    "Nora Broad.",
    "He looked faintly puzzled.",
    "The other girl who disappeared about the same time as Verity Hunt\ndid.",
    "You remember you mentioned her to me.",
    "A girl who had\n\n\fboyfriends and was I understand very ready to have boyfriends.",
    "A\nfoolish girl but attractive apparently to the male sex.",
    "I think said Miss\nMarple that to learn a little more about her might help me in my\nenquiries.",
    "Have it your own way DetectiveInspector Marple said Professor\nWanstead.",
    "The service took place on the following morning.",
    "All the members of\nthe tour were there.",
    "Miss Marple looked round the church.",
    "Several of\nthe locals were there also.",
    "Mrs Glynne was there and her sister\nClotilde.",
    "The youngest one Anthea did not attend.",
    "There were one or\ntwo people from the village also she thought.",
    "Probably not acquainted\nwith Miss Temple but there out of a rather morbid curiosity in regard to\nwhat was now spoken of by the term foul play.",
    "There was too an\nelderly clergyman in gaiters well over seventy Miss Marple thought\na broadshouldered old man with a noble mane of white hair.",
    "He was\nslightly crippled and found it difficult both to kneel and to stand.",
    "It was\na fine face Miss Marple thought and she wondered who he was.",
    "Some\nold friend of Elizabeth Temple she presumed who might perhaps have\ncome from quite a long distance to attend the service\n\nAs they came out of the church Miss Marple exchanged a few words\nwith her fellow travellers.",
    "She knew now pretty well who was doing\nwhat.",
    "The Butlers were returning to London.",
    "I told Henry I just couldnt go on with it said Mrs Butler.",

    "Someone who has got a down on the Famous Houses of England.",
    "Now then Mamie now then said Mr Butler dont you let your\nimagination go as far as that\n\nWell you just dont know nowadays.",
    "What with hijackers about and\nkidnapping and all the rest of it I dont feel really protected\nanywhere.",
    "Old Miss Lumley and Miss Bentham were continuing with the tour their\nanxieties allayed.",
    "Weve paid very highly for this tour and it seems a pity to miss\nanything just because this very sad accident has happened.",
    "We rang\nup a very good neighbour of ours last night and they are going to see\nto the cats so we dont need to worry.",
    "It was going to remain an accident for Miss Lumley and Miss Bentham.",

    "Thats what youre going to do isnt it Miss\nMarple\n\nI really think so said Miss Marple.",
    "I dont feel quite equal to going on\ntravelling and all that.",
    "I think a day or twos rest would be helpful to me\nafter whats happened.",
    "As the little crowd dispersed Miss Marple took an unostentatious\nroute of her own.",
    "From her handbag she took out a leaf torn from her\nnotebook on which she had entered two addresses.",
    "The first a Mrs\nBlackett lived in a neat little house and garden just by the end of the\nroad where it sloped down towards the valley.",

    "But of course Im sixtyfive and I\nknow whats what and I know the way a girl looks and I think I know\nwho it was but Im not sure.",
    "I might have been wrong because he went\non living in the place and he was real cut up when Nora was missing.",

    "She was idle and she wasnt too clever at her\nbooks either.",
    "No.",

    "Id say shell go on the\nstreets in the end.",
    "I dont believe she has any future but that.",
    "I dont\nlike to say these things but there it is.",
    "Anyway perhaps its better than\ngetting herself murdered like Miss Hunt did what lived at The Old\nManor House.",
    "Cruel that was.",
    "They thought shed gone off with\nsomeone and the police they was busy.",
    "Always asking questions and\nhaving the young men whod been with the girl up to help them with\ntheir enquiries and all that.",

    "My friend knew nothing\nabout her but I gathered she came from this village.",
    "So I wondered if\n\n\fthere was anyone here who could  well tell me something about her.",

    "Mind you I didnt\napprove of all Noras goingson.",

    "She was all right.",
    "Id say as likely as not shes\nmaking a bit of money still in London or one of these big towns doing a\nstriptease something of that kind.",
    "Thats the kind she was.",
    "I dont think said Miss Marple that if its the same person that\nshed be very suitable for my friend.",

    "I am not quite as strong as I was.",
    "He lowered\nhimself carefully into a chair.",
    "And you \n\nMiss Marple sat down beside him.",
    "Yes she said you wanted to see me\n\nWell I must explain how that comes about.",
    "Im quite aware that I am a\ncomplete stranger to you.",
    "As a matter of fact I made a short visit to the\nhospital at Carristown talking to the matron before going on to the\nchurch here.",
    "It was she who told me that before she died Elizabeth had\nasked to see a fellow member of the tour Miss Jane Marple.",

    "Thats why I was\nsurprised.",
    "We had expressed ideas to each other occasionally sat\nnext to each other in the coach and had struck up quite an\nacquaintanceship.",
    "But I was surprised that she should have expressed\na wish to see me when she was so ill.",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes I can quite imagine that.",
    "She was as I have said a very old\nfriend of mine.",
    "In fact she was coming to see me to visit me.",
    "I live in\nFillminster which is where your coach tour will be stopping the day\nafter tomorrow.",
    "And by arrangement she was coming to visit me there\nshe wanted to talk to me about various matters about which she\nthought I could help her.",
    "I see said Miss Marple.",
    "May I ask you a question I hope it is not too\nintimate a question.",
    "Of course Miss Marple.",
    "Ask me anything you like.",
    "One of the things Miss Temple said to me was that her presence on\nthe tour was not merely because she wished to visit historic homes\nand gardens.",
    "She described it by a rather unusual word to use as\npilgrimage.",
    "Did she said Archdeacon Brabazon.",
    "Did she indeed now Yes\nthats interesting.",
    "Interesting and perhaps significant.",
    "So what I am asking you is do you think that the pilgrimage she spoke\nof was her visit to you\n\nI think it must have been said the Archdeacon.",
    "Yes I think so.",
    "We had been talking said Miss Marple about a young girl.",

    "Certain information about Verity\n\nYes.",
    "That is why she was coming to me.",
    "She wanted to know certain\nfacts.",
    "She wanted to know said Miss Marple why Verity broke off her\nengagement to marry Mr Rafiels son.",
    "Verity said Archdeacon\n\nBrabazon did not break off her\n\nengagement.",
    "I am certain of that.",
    "As certain as one can be of\nanything.",
    "Miss Temple did not know that did she\n\nNo.",
    "I think she was puzzled and unhappy about what happened and\nwas coming to me to ask me why the marriage did not take place.",
    "And why did it not take place asked Miss Marple.",
    "Please do not\nthink that I am unduly curious.",
    "Its not idle curiosity that is driving me.",
    "I\ntoo am on not a pilgrimage but what I should call a mission.",
    "I too want\nto know why Michael Rafiel and Verity Hunt did not marry.",
    "The Archdeacon studied her for a moment or two.",
    "You are involved in some way he said.",
    "I see that.",
    "I am involved said Miss Marple by the dying wishes of Michael\nRafiels father.",
    "He asked me to do this for him.",
    "I have no reason not to tell you all I know said the Archdeacon\nslowly.",
    "You are asking me what Elizabeth Temple would have been\nasking me you are asking me something I do not know myself.",
    "Those\n\n\ftwo young people Miss Marple intended to marry.",
    "They had made\narrangements to marry.",
    "I was going to marry them.",
    "It was a marriage I\ngather which was being kept secret.",
    "I knew both these young people.",
    "I knew that dear child Verity from a long way back.",
    "I prepared her for\nconfirmation I used to hold services in Lent for Easter on other\noccasions in Elizabeth Temples school.",
    "A very fine school it was too.",
    "A very fine woman she was.",
    "A wonderful teacher with a great sense of\neach girls capabilities  for what she was best fitted for in studies.",
    "She\nurged careers on girls she thought would relish careers and did not\nforce girls that she felt were not really suited to them.",
    "She was a great\nwoman and a very dear friend.",
    "Verity was one of the most beautiful\nchildren girls rather that I have come across.",
    "Beautiful in mind in\nheart as well as in appearance.",
    "She had the great misfortune to lose\nher parents before she was truly adult.",
    "They were both killed in a\ncharter plane going on a holiday to Italy.",
    "Verity went to live when she\nleft school with a Miss Clotilde BradburyScott whom you know\nprobably as living here.",
    "She had been a close friend of Veritys\nmother.",
    "There are three sisters though the second one was married\nand living abroad so there were only two of them living here.",
    "Clotilde\nthe eldest one became extremely attached to Verity.",
    "She did\neverything possible to give her a happy life.",
    "She took her abroad once\nor twice gave her art lessons in Italy and loved and cared for her\ndearly in every way.",
    "Verity too came to love her probably as much as\nshe could have loved her own mother.",
    "She depended on Clotilde.",
    "Clotilde herself was an intellectual and well educated woman.",
    "She did\nnot urge a university career on Verity but this I gather was really\nbecause Verity did not really yearn after one.",
    "She preferred to study\nart and music and such subjects.",
    "She lived here at The Old Manor\nHouse and had I think a very happy life.",
    "She always seemed to be\nhappy.",
    "Naturally I did not see her after she came here since\n\n\fFillminster where I was in the cathedral is nearly sixty miles from here.",
    "I wrote to her at Christmas and other festivals and she remembered\nme always with a Christmas card.",
    "But I saw nothing of her until the day\ncame when she suddenly turned up a very beautiful and fully grown\nyoung woman by then with an attractive young man whom I also\nhappened to know slightly Mr Rafiels son Michael.",
    "They came to me\nbecause they were in love with each other and wanted to get married.",
    "And you agreed to marry them\n\nYes I did.",
    "Perhaps Miss Marple you may think that I should not have\ndone so.",
    "They had come to me in secret it was obvious.",
    "Clotilde\nBradburyScott I should imagine had tried to discourage the romance\nbetween them.",
    "She was well within her rights in doing so.",
    "Michael\nRafiel I will tell you frankly was not the kind of husband you would\nwant for any daughter or relation of yours.",
    "She was too young really to\nmake up her mind and Michael had been a source of trouble ever\nsince his very young days.",
    "He had been had up before junior courts he\nhad had unsuitable friends he had been drawn into various gangster\nactivities hed sabotaged buildings and telephone boxes.",
    "He had been\non intimate terms with various girls had maintenance claims which he\nhad had to meet.",
    "Yes he was a bad lot with the girls as well as in other\nways yet he was extremely attractive and they fell for him and\nbehaved in an extremely silly fashion.",
    "He had served two short jail\nsentences.",
    "Frankly he had a criminal record.",
    "I was acquainted with\nhis father though I did not know him well and I think that his father did\nall that he could all that a man of his character could to help his son.",
    "He came to his rescue he got him jobs in which he might have\nsucceeded.",
    "He paid up his debts paid out damages.",
    "He did all this.",
    "I\ndont know \n\n\fBut he could have done more you think\n\nNo said the Archdeacon Ive come to an age now when I know that\none must accept ones fellow human beings as being the kind of\npeople and having the kind of shall we say in modern terms genetic\nmakeup which gives them the characters they have.",
    "I dont think that\nMr Rafiel had affection for his son a great affection at any time.",
    "To say\nhe was reasonably fond of him would be the most you could say.",
    "He\ngave him no love.",
    "Whether it would have been better for Michael if he\nhad had love from his father I do not know.",
    "Perhaps it would have\nmade no difference.",
    "As it was it was sad.",
    "The boy was not stupid.",
    "He\nhad a certain amount of intellect and talent.",
    "He could have done well if\nhe had wished to do well and had taken the trouble.",
    "But he was by\nnature let us admit it frankly a delinquent.",
    "He had certain qualities\none appreciated.",
    "He had a sense of humour he was in various ways\ngenerous and kindly.",
    "He would stand by a friend help a friend out of a\nscrape.",
    "He treated his girlfriends badly got them into trouble as the\nlocal saying is and then more or less abandoned them and took up\nwith somebody else.",
    "So there I was faced with those two and yes I\nagreed to marry them.",
    "I told Verity I told her quite frankly the kind of\nboy she wanted to marry.",
    "I found that he had not tried to deceive her in\nany way.",
    "Hed told her that hed always been in trouble both with the\npolice and in every other way.",
    "He told her that he was going when he\nmarried her to turn over a new leaf.",
    "Everything would be changed.",
    "I\nwarned her that that would not happen he would not change.",
    "People\ndo not change.",
    "He might mean to change.",
    "Verity I think knew that\nalmost as well as I did.",
    "She admitted that she knew it.",
    "She said I know\nwhat Mike is like.",
    "I know hell probably always be like it but I love him.",
    "I\nmay be able to help him and I may not.",
    "But Ill take that risk.",
    "And I will\n\n\ftell you this Miss Marple.",
    "I know none better I have done a lot with\nyoung people I have married a lot of young people and I have seen\nthem come to grief I have seen them unexpectedly turn out well but I\nknow this and recognise it.",
    "I know when a couple are really in love with\neach other.",
    "And by that I do not mean just sexually attracted.",
    "There is\ntoo much talk about sex too much attention is paid to it.",
    "I do not mean\nthat anything about sex is wrong.",
    "That is nonsense.",
    "But sex cannot\ntake the place of love it goes with love but it cannot succeed by itself.",
    "To love means the words of the marriage service.",
    "For better for\nworse for richer for poorer in sickness and in health.",
    "That is what you\ntake on if you love and wish to marry.",
    "Those two loved each other.",
    "To\nlove and to cherish until death do us part.",
    "And that said the\nArchdeacon is where my story ends.",
    "I cannot go on because I do not\nknow what happened.",
    "I only know that I agreed to do as they asked\nthat I made the necessary arrangements we settled a day an hour a\ntime a place.",
    "I think perhaps that I was to blame for agreeing to the\nsecrecy.",
    "They didnt want anyone to know said Miss Marple.",
    "No.",
    "Verity did not want anyone to know and I should say most\ncertainly Mike did not want anyone to know.",
    "They were afraid of being\nstopped.",
    "To Verity I think besides love there was also a feeling of\nescape.",
    "Natural I think owing to the circumstances of her life.",
    "She\nhad lost her real guardians her parents she had entered on her new\nlife after their death at an age when a schoolgirl arrives at having a\ncrush on someone.",
    "An attractive mistress.",
    "Anything from the games\nmistress to the mathematics mistress or a prefect or an older girl.",
    "A\nstate that does not last for very long is merely a natural part of life.",
    "Then from that you go on to the next stage when you realise that what\n\n\fyou want in your life is what complements yourself.",
    "A relationship\nbetween a man and a woman.",
    "You start then to look about you for a\nmate.",
    "The mate you want in life.",
    "And if you are wise you take your\ntime you have friends but you are looking as the old nurses used to\nsay to children for Mr Right to come along.",
    "Clotilde BradburyScott\nwas exceptionally good to Verity and Verity I think gave her what I\nshould call heroworship.",
    "She was a personality as a woman.",
    "Handsome accomplished interesting.",
    "I think Verity adored her in an\nalmost romantic way and I think Clotilde came to love Verity as though\nshe were her own daughter.",
    "And so Verity grew to maturity in an\natmosphere of adoration lived an interesting life with interesting\nsubjects to stimulate her intellect.",
    "It was a happy life but I think little\nby little she was conscious  conscious without knowing she was\nconscious shall we say of a wish to escape.",
    "Escape from being loved.",
    "To escape she didnt know into what or where.",
    "But she did know after\nshe met Michael.",
    "She wanted to escape to a life where male and\nfemale come together to create the next stage of living in this world.",
    "But she knew that it was impossible to make Clotilde understand how\nshe felt.",
    "She knew that Clotilde would be bitterly opposed to her taking\nher love for Michael seriously.",
    "And Clotilde I fear was right in her\nbelief...",
    "I know that now.",
    "He was not a husband that Verity ought to\nhave taken or had.",
    "The road that she started out on led not to life not\nto increased living and happiness.",
    "It led to shock pain death.",
    "You see\nMiss Marple that I have a grave feeling of guilt.",
    "My motives were good\nbut I didnt know what I ought to have known.",
    "I knew Verity but I didnt\nknow Michael.",
    "I understood Veritys wish for secrecy because I knew\nwhat a strong personality Clotilde BradburyScott had.",
    "She might have\nhad a strong enough influence over Verity to persuade her to give up\nthe marriage.",
    "You think then that that was what she did do You think Clotilde told\nher enough about Michael to persuade her to give up the idea of\nmarrying him\n\nNo I do not believe that.",
    "I still do not.",
    "Verity would have told me if so.",
    "She would have got word to me.",
    "What did actually happen on that day\n\nI havent told you that yet.",
    "The day was fixed.",
    "The time the hour and\nthe place and I waited.",
    "Waited for a bride and bridegroom who didnt\ncome who sent no word no excuse nothing.",
    "I didnt know why I\nnever have known why.",
    "It still seems to me unbelievable.",
    "Unbelievable\nI mean not that they did not come that could be explicable easily\nenough but that they sent no word.",
    "Some scrawled line of writing.",
    "And\nthat is why I wondered and hoped that Elizabeth Temple before she\ndied might have told you something.",
    "Given you some message\nperhaps for me.",
    "If she knew or had any idea that she was dying she\nmight have wanted to get a message to me.",
    "She wanted information from you said Miss Marple.",
    "That I am sure\nwas the reason she was coming to you.",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes that is probably true.",
    "It seemed to me you see that Verity\nwould have said nothing to the people who could have stopped her\nClotilde and Anthea BradburyScott but because she had always been\nvery devoted to Elizabeth Temple  and Elizabeth Temple had had\ngreat influence over her  it seems to me that she would have written\nand given her information of some kind.",
    "I think she did said Miss Marple.",
    "Information you think\n\nThe information she gave to Elizabeth Temple said Miss Marple\nwas this.",
    "That she was going to marry Michael Rafiel.",
    "Miss Temple\nknew that.",
    "It was one of the things she said to me.",
    "She said I knew a\ngirl called Verity who was going to marry Michael Rafiel and the only\nperson who could have told her that was Verity herself.",
    "Verity must\nhave written to her or sent some word to her.",
    "And then when I said\nWhy didnt she marry him she said She died.",
    "Then we come to a full stop said Archdeacon Brabazon.",
    "He sighed.",
    "Elizabeth and I know no more than those two facts.",
    "Elizabeth that\nVerity was going to marry Michael.",
    "And I that those two were going to\nmarry that they had arranged it and that they were coming on a\nsettled day and time.",
    "And I waited for them but there was no\nmarriage.",
    "No bride no bridegroom no word.",
    "And you have no idea what happened said Miss Marple.",
    "I do not for one minute believe that Verity or Michael definitely parted\nbroke off.",
    "But something must have happened between them Something that\nopened Veritys eyes perhaps to certain aspects of Michaels\ncharacter and personality that she had not realised or known before.",
    "That is not a satisfying answer because still she would have let me\nknow.",
    "She would not have left me waiting to join them together in holy\n\n\fmatrimony.",
    "To put the most ridiculous side of it she was a girl with\nbeautiful manners well brought up.",
    "She would have sent word.",
    "No.",
    "Im\nafraid that only one thing could have happened.",
    "Death said Miss Marple.",
    "She was remembering that one word that\nElizabeth Temple had said which had sounded like the deep tone of a\nbell.",
    "Yes.",
    "Archdeacon Brabazon sighed.",
    "Death.",
    "Love said Miss Marple thoughtfully.",
    "By that you mean  he hesitated.",
    "Its what Miss Temple said to me.",
    "I said What killed her and she said\nLove and that love was the most frightening word in the world.",
    "The\nmost frightening word.",
    "I see said the Archdeacon.",
    "I see or I think I see.",
    "What is your solution\n\nSplit personality he sighed.",
    "Something that is not apparent to other\npeople unless they are technically qualified to observe it.",
    "Jekyll and\nHyde are real you know.",
    "They were not Stevensons invention as such.",
    "Michael Rafiel was  must have been  schizophrenic.",
    "He had a dual\npersonality.",
    "I have no medical knowledge no psychoanalytic\nexperience.",
    "But there must have been in him the two parts of two\nidentities.",
    "One a wellmeaning almost lovable boy a boy perhaps\nwhose principal attraction was his wish for happiness.",
    "But there was\n\n\falso a second personality someone who was forced by some mental\ndeformation perhaps something we as yet are not sure of  to kill  not\nan enemy but the person he loved and so he killed Verity.",
    "Not\nknowing perhaps why he had to or what it meant.",
    "There are very\nfrightening things in this world of ours mental quirks mental disease\nor deformity of a brain.",
    "One of my parishioners was a very sad case in\npoint.",
    "Two elderly women living together pensioned.",
    "They had been\nfriends in service together somewhere.",
    "They appeared to be a happy\ncouple.",
    "And yet one day one of them killed the other.",
    "She sent for an\nold friend of hers the vicar of her parish and said I have killed\nLouisa.",
    "It is very sad she said but I saw the devil looking out of her\neyes and I knew I was being commanded to kill her.",
    "Things like that\nmake one sometimes despair of living.",
    "One says why and how and\nyet one day knowledge will come.",
    "Doctors will find out or learn just\nsome small deformity of a chromosome or gene.",
    "Some gland that\noverworks or leaves off working.",
    "So you think thats what happened said Miss Marple.",
    "It did happen.",
    "The body was not found I know for some time\nafterwards.",
    "Verity just disappeared.",
    "She went away from home and\nwas not seen again...",
    "But it must have happened then that very day \n\nBut surely at the trial \n\nYou mean after the body was found when the police finally arrested\nMichael\n\n\fHe had been one of the first you know to be asked to come and give\nassistance to the police.",
    "He had been seen about with the girl she had\nbeen noticed in his car.",
    "They were sure all along that he was the man\nthey wanted.",
    "He was their first suspect and they never stopped\nsuspecting him.",
    "The other young men who had known Verity were\nquestioned and one and all had alibis or lack of evidence.",
    "They\ncontinued to suspect Michael and finally the body was found.",
    "Strangled and the head and face disfigured with heavy blows.",
    "A mad\nfrenzied attack.",
    "He wasnt sane when he struck those blows.",
    "Mr Hyde\nlet us say had taken over.",
    "Miss Marple shivered.",
    "The Archdeacon went on his voice low and sad.",
    "And yet even now\nsometimes I hope and feel that it was some other young man who\nkilled her.",
    "Someone who was definitely mentally deranged though no\none had any idea of it.",
    "Some stranger perhaps whom she had met in\nthe neighbourhood.",
    "Someone whom she had met by chance who had\ngiven her a lift in a car and then  He shook his head.",
    "I suppose that could have been true said Miss Marple.",
    "Mike made a bad impression in court said the Archdeacon.",
    "Told\nfoolish and senseless lies.",
    "Lied as to where his car had been.",
    "Got his\nfriends to give him impossible alibis.",
    "He was frightened.",
    "He said\nnothing of his plan to marry.",
    "I believe his Counsel was of the opinion\nthat that would tell against him that she might have been forcing him to\nmarry her and that he didnt want to.",
    "Its so long ago now I remember\nno details.",
    "But the evidence was dead against him.",
    "He was guilty and\nhe looked guilty.",
    "So you see do you not Miss Marple that Im a very sad and unhappy\nman.",
    "I made the wrong judgement I encouraged a very sweet and\nlovely girl to go to her death because I did not know enough of human\nnature.",
    "I was ignorant of the danger she was running.",
    "I believed that if\nshe had had any fear of him any sudden knowledge of something evil\nin him she would have broken her pledge to marry him and have come\nto me and told me of her fear of her new knowledge of him.",
    "But\nnothing of that ever happened.",
    "Why did he kill her Did he kill her\nbecause perhaps he knew she was going to have a child Because by\nnow he had formed a tie with some other girl and did not want to be\nforced to marry Verity I cant believe it.",
    "Or was it some entirely\ndifferent reason.",
    "Because she had suddenly felt a fear of him a\nknowledge of danger from him and had broken off her association\nwith him Did that rouse his anger his fury and did that lead him to\nviolence and to killing her One does not know.",
    "You do not know said Miss Marple but you do still know and\nbelieve one thing dont you\n\nWhat do you mean exactly by believe Are you talking from the\nreligious point of view\n\nOh no said Miss Marple I didnt mean that.",
    "I mean there seems to\nbe in you or so I feel it a very strong belief that those two loved each\nother that they meant to marry but that something happened that\nprevented it.",
    "Something that ended in her death but you still really\nbelieve that they were coming to you to get married that day\n\n\fYou are quite right my dear.",
    "Yes I cannot help still believing in two\nlovers who wished to get married who were ready to take each other\non for better for worse for richer or poorer in sickness and in health.",
    "She loved him and she would have taken him for better or for worse.",
    "As far as she had gone she took him for worse.",
    "It brought about her\ndeath.",
    "You must go on believing as you do said Miss Marple.",
    "I think you\nknow that I believe it too.",
    "But then what\n\nI dont know yet said Miss Marple.",
    "Im not sure but I think Elizabeth\nTemple did know or was beginning to know what happened.",
    "A\nfrightening word she said.",
    "Love.",
    "I thought when she spoke that what\nshe meant was that because of a love affair Verity committed suicide.",
    "Because she found out something about Michael or because\nsomething about Michael suddenly upset her and revolted her.",
    "But it\ncouldnt have been suicide.",
    "No said the Archdeacon that couldnt be so.",
    "The injuries were\ndescribed very fully at the trial.",
    "You dont commit suicide by beating in\nyour own head.",
    "Horrible said Miss Marple.",
    "Horrible And you couldnt do that to\nanyone you loved even if you had to kill for love could you If hed\nkilled her he couldnt have done it that way.",
    "Strangling perhaps but\nyou wouldnt beat in the face and the head that you loved.",
    "She\nmurmured Love love a frightening word.",
    "Chapter 19\n\nGOODBYES ARE SAID\n\nThe coach was drawn up in front of the Golden Boar on the following\nmorning.",
    "Miss Marple had come down and was saying goodbye to\nvarious friends.",
    "She found Mrs RiseleyPorter in a state of high\nindignation.",
    "Really girls nowadays she said.",
    "No vigour.",
    "No stamina.",
    "Miss Marple looked at her enquiringly.",
    "Joanna I mean.",
    "My niece.",
    "Oh dear.",

    "I cant see anything much the matter with her.",
    "She\nsays shes got a sore throat she feels she might have a temperature\ncoming on.",
    "All nonsense I think.",
    "Oh Im very sorry said Miss Marple.",
    "Is there anything I can do\nLook after her\n\nI should leave her alone if I were you said Mrs RiseleyPorter.",
    "If\nyou ask me its all an excuse.",
    "Miss Marple looked enquiringly at her once more.",
    "Girls are so silly.",
    "Always falling in love.",
    "Emlyn Price said Miss Marple.",
    "Oh so youve noticed it too.",
    "Yes theyre really getting to a stage of\nspooning about together.",
    "I dont much care for him anyway.",
    "One of\nthese longhaired students you know.",
    "Always going on demos or\nsomething like that.",
    "Why cant they say demonstration properly I hate\nabbreviations.",
    "And how am I going to get along.",
    "Nobody to look after\nme collect my luggage take it in take it out.",
    "Really.",
    "Im paying for this\ncomplete trip and everything.",
    "I thought she seemed so attentive to you said Miss Marple.",
    "Well not the last day or two.",
    "Girls dont understand that people have\nto have a little assistance when they get to middle age.",
    "They seem to\nhave some absurd idea she and the Price boy of going to visit some\nmountain or some landmark.",
    "About a seven or eight mile walk there\nand back.",
    "But surely if she has a sore throat and a temperature...\n\nYoull see as soon as the coach is gone the sore throat will get better\nand the temperature will go down said Mrs RiseleyPorter.",
    "Oh dear\nweve got to get on board now.",
    "Oh goodbye Miss Marple its nice to\nhave met you.",
    "Im sorry youre not coming with us.",
    "Im very sorry myself said Miss Marple but really you know Im not\nso young and vigorous as you are Mrs RiseleyPorter and I really feel\nafter all the  well shock and everything else the last few days I really\nmust have a complete twentyfour hours rest.",
    "Well hope to see you somewhere in the future.",
    "They shook hands.",
    "Mrs RiseleyPorter climbed into the coach.",
    "A voice behind Miss Marples shoulder said\n\nBon Voyage and Good Riddance.",
    "She turned to see Emlyn Price.",
    "He was grinning.",
    "Was that addressed to Mrs RiseleyPorter\n\nYes.",
    "Who else.",
    "Im sorry to hear that Joanna is under the weather this morning.",
    "Emlyn Price grinned at Miss Marple again.",
    "Shell be all right he said as soon as that coach is gone.",
    "Oh really said Miss Marple do you mean\n\nYes I do mean said Emlyn Price.",
    "Joannas had enough of that aunt\nof hers bossing her around all the time.",
    "Then you are not going in the coach either\n\nNo.",
    "Im staying on here for a couple of days.",
    "Im going to get around a\nbit and do a few excursions.",
    "Dont look so disapproving Miss Marple.",
    "Youre not really as disapproving as all that are you\n\nWell said Miss Marple I have known such things happen in my own\nyouth.",
    "The excuses may have been different and I think we had less\nchance of getting away with things than you do now.",
    "Colonel and Mrs Walker came up and shook Miss Marple warmly by the\nhand.",
    "So nice to have known you and had all those delightful horticultural\ntalks said the Colonel.",
    "I believe the day after tomorrow were going\nto have a real treat if nothing else happens.",
    "Really its too sad this\nvery unfortunate accident.",
    "I must say I think myself it is an accident.",
    "I\nreally think the Coroner was going beyond everything in his feelings\nabout this.",
    "It seems very odd said Miss Marple that nobody has come forward\nif they were up on top there pushing about rocks and boulders and\nthings that they havent come forward to say so.",
    "Think theyll be blamed of course said Colonel Walker.",
    "Theyre\ngoing to keep jolly quiet thats what theyre going to do.",
    "Well goodbye.",
    "Ill send you a cutting of that Magnolia highdownensis and one of\nthe Mahonia japonica too.",

    "They walked round the corner of the hotel.",
    "There was some gay hornblowing and the coach departed.",
    "I wish in a way you know said Professor Wanstead that you\nwerent staying behind.",
    "Id rather have seen you safely on your way in\nthe coach.",
    "He looked at her sharply.",
    "Why are you staying here\nNervous exhaustion or something else\n\nSomething else said Miss Marple.",
    "Im not particularly exhausted\nthough it makes a perfectly natural excuse for somebody of my age.",
    "I feel really I ought to stay here and keep an eye on you.",
    "No said Miss Marple theres no need to do that.",
    "There are other\nthings you ought to be doing.",
    "What things He looked at her.",
    "Have you got ideas or knowledge\n\n\fI think I have knowledge but Ill have to verify it.",
    "There are certain\nthings that I cant do myself.",
    "I think you will help to do them because\nyoure in touch with what I refer to as the authorities.",
    "Meaning Scotland Yard Chief Constables and the Governors of Her\nMajestys Prisons\n\nYes.",
    "One or other or all of them.",
    "You might have the Home Secretary\nin your pocket too.",
    "You certainly do have ideas Well what do you want me to do\n\nFirst of all I want to give you this address.",
    "She took out a notebook and tore out one page and handed it to him.",
    "Whats this Oh yes well known charity isnt it\n\nOne of the better ones I believe.",
    "They do a lot of good.",
    "You send them\nclothes said Miss Marple childrens clothes and womens clothes.",
    "Coats.",
    "Pullovers all those sort of things.",
    "Well do you want me to contribute to this\n\nNo its not an appeal for charity its a bit of what belongs to what\nwere doing.",
    "What you and I are doing.",
    "In what way\n\n\fI want you to make enquiries there about a parcel which was sent\nfrom here two days ago posted from this post office.",
    "Who posted it  did you\n\nNo said Miss Marple.",
    "No.",
    "But I assumed responsibility for it.",
    "What does that mean\n\nIt means said Miss Marple smiling slightly that I went into the post\noffice here and I explained rather scattily and well like the old pussy I\nam.",
    "that I had very foolishly asked someone to take a parcel for me\nand post it and I had put the wrong address on it.",
    "I was very upset by\nthis.",
    "The postmistress very kindly said she remembered the parcel\nbut the address on it was not the one I was mentioning.",
    "It was this one\nthe one I have just given to you.",
    "I explained that I had been very foolish\nand written the wrong address on it confusing it with another one I\nsometimes send things to.",
    "She told me it was too late to do anything\nabout it now because the parcel naturally had gone off.",
    "I said it was\nquite all right that I would send a letter to the particular charity to\nwhich the parcel had been sent and explain that it had been\naddressed to them by mistake.",
    "Would they very kindly forward it on to\nthe charity that I had meant to receive it.",
    "It seems rather a roundabout way.",
    "Well said Miss Marple one has to say something.",
    "Im not going to\ndo that at all.",
    "You are going to deal with the matter.",
    "Weve got to know\nwhats inside that parcel I have no doubt you can get means.",
    "Will there be anything inside the parcel to say who actually sent it\n\nI rather think not.",
    "It may have a slip of paper saying from friends or it\nmay have a fictitious name and address something like Mrs Pippin 14\nWestbourne Grove and if anyone made enquiries there thered be no\nperson of such a name living there.",
    "Oh.",
    "Any other alternatives\n\nIt might possibly most unlikely but possibly have a slip saying From\nMiss Anthea BradburyScott\n\nDid she\n\nShe took it to the post said Miss Marple.",
    "And you had asked her to take it there\n\nOh no said Miss Marple.",
    "I hadnt asked anyone to post anything.",
    "The first I saw of the parcel was when Anthea passed the garden of the\nGolden Boar where you and I were sitting talking carrying it.",
    "But you went to the post office and represented that the parcel was\nyours.",
    "Yes said Miss Marple which was quite untrue.",
    "But post offices are\ncareful.",
    "And you see I wanted to find out where it had been sent.",
    "You wanted to find out if such a parcel had been sent and if it had\nbeen sent by one of the BradburyScotts or especially Miss Anthea\n\n\fI knew it would be Anthea said Miss Marple because wed seen\nher.",
    "Well He took the paper from her hand.",
    "Yes I can set this in motion.",
    "You think this parcel will be interesting\n\nI think the contents of it might be quite important.",
    "You like keeping your secrets dont you said Professor Wanstead.",
    "Not exactly secrets said Miss Marple they are only probabilities\nthat I am exploring.",
    "One does not like to make definite assertions\nunless one has a little more definite knowledge.",
    "Anything else\n\nI think...",
    "I think that whoevers in charge of these things ought to be\nwarned that there might be a second body to be routed.",
    "Do you mean a second body connected with the particular crime that\nwe have been considering A crime that took place ten years ago\n\nYes said Miss Marple.",
    "Im quite sure of it as a matter of fact.",
    "Another body.",
    "Whose body\n\nWell said Miss Marple its only my idea so far...\n\nAny idea where this body is\n\n\fOh Yes said Miss Marple Im quite sure I know where it is but I\nhave to have a little more time before I can tell you that.",
    "What kind of a body Mans Womans Childs Girls\n\nTheres another girl who is missing said Miss Marple.",
    "A girl called\nNora Broad.",
    "She disappeared from here and shes never been heard\nany more of.",
    "I think her body might be in a particular place.",
    "Professor Wanstead looked at her.",
    "You know the more you say the less I like leaving you here he said.",
    "Having all these ideas  and possibly doing something foolish either\nhe stopped.",
    "Either its all nonsense  said Miss Marple.",
    "No no I didnt mean that.",
    "But either you know too much  which might\nbe dangerous...",
    "I think I am going to stay here to keep an eye on you.",
    "No youre not said Miss Marple.",
    "Youve got to go to London and set\ncertain things moving.",
    "You spoke as though you knew a good deal Miss Marple.",
    "I think I do know a good deal now.",
    "But I have got to be sure.",
    "Yes but if you make sure that may be the last thing you do  make\nsure of We dont want a third body.",
    "Yours.",
    "Oh Im not expecting anything like that said Miss Marple.",
    "There might be danger you know if any of your ideas are right.",
    "Have\nyou suspicions of any one particular person\n\nI think I have certain knowledge as to one person.",
    "I have got to find\nout...",
    "I have got to stay here.",
    "You asked me once if I felt an atmosphere\nof evil.",
    "Well that atmosphere is here all right an atmosphere of evil of\ndanger if you like of great unhappiness of fear... Ive got to do\nsomething about that.",
    "The best I can do.",
    "But an old woman like me\ncant do very much.",
    "Professor Wanstead counted under his breath.",
    "One two three four.",
    "What are you counting asked Miss Marple.",
    "The people who left in the coach.",
    "Presumably youre not interested in\nthem since youve let them go off and youre staying here.",
    "Why should I be interested in them\n\nBecause you said Mr Rafiel had sent you in the coach for a particular\nreason and sent you on this tour for a particular reason and sent you to\nThe Old Manor House for a particular reason.",
    "Very well then.",
    "The\ndeath of Elizabeth Temple ties up with someone in the coach.",
    "Your\nremaining here ties up with The Old Manor House.",
    "Youre not quite right said Miss Marple.",
    "There are connections\nbetween the two.",
    "I want someone to tell me things.",
    "Do you think you can make anyone tell you things\n\nI think I might.",
    "Youll miss your train if you dont go soon.",
    "Take care of yourself said Professor Wanstead.",
    "I mean to take care of myself.",
    "The door into the lounge opened and two people came out.",
    "Miss Cooke\nand Miss Barrow.",
    "Hullo said Professor Wanstead I thought youd gone off with the\ncoach.",
    "Well we changed our minds at the last moment said Miss Cooke\ncheerfully.",
    "You know weve just discovered that there are some very\nagreeable walks near here and there are one or two places Im very\nanxious to see.",
    "A church with a very unusual Saxon font.",
    "Only four or\nfive miles away and quite easily reached by the local bus I think.",
    "You\nsee its not only houses and gardens.",
    "Im very interested in church\narchitecture.",
    "So am I said Miss Barrow.",
    "Theres also Finley Park which is a very\nfine piece of horticultural planting not far from here.",
    "We really thought\nthat it would be much pleasanter to stay here for a day or two.",
    "Youre staying here at the Golden Boar\n\n\fYes.",
    "We were fortunate enough to be able to get a very nice double\nroom.",
    "Really a better one than the one we have had for the last two\ndays.",
    "You will miss your train said Miss Marple again.",
    "I wish said Professor Wanstead that you \n\nI shall be quite all right said Miss Marple urgently.",
    "Such a kind\nman she said as he disappeared round the side of the house who\nreally takes so much care of me.",
    "I might be a greataunt of his or\nsomething like that.",
    "Its all been a great shock hasnt it said Miss Cooke.",
    "Perhaps you\nmay like to come with us when we go to visit St Martins in the Grove.",
    "Youre very kind said Miss Marple but I dont think today I feel quite\nstrong enough for expeditions.",
    "Perhaps tomorrow if there is anything\ninteresting to see.",
    "Well we must leave you then.",
    "Miss Marple smiled at them both and went into the hotel.",
    "Chapter 20\n\nMISS MARPLE HAS IDEAS\n\n\fHaving had lunch in the dining room Miss Marple went out on the\nterrace to drink her coffee.",
    "She was just sipping her second cup when\na tall thin figure came striding up the steps and approached her\nspeaking rather breathlessly.",
    "She saw that it was Anthea BradburyScott.",
    "Oh Miss Marple weve only just heard you know that you didnt go\nwith the coach after all.",
    "We thought you were going on with the tour.",
    "We had no idea you were staying on here.",
    "Both Clotilde and Lavinia\nsent me here to say we do so hope you will come back to The Old\nManor House and stay with us.",
    "Im sure it will be nicer for you to be\nthere.",
    "There are so many people coming and going here always\nespecially over a weekend and things like that.",
    "So wed be very very\nglad we really would if you would come back to us.",
    "Oh thats very kind of you said Miss Marple.",
    "Really very kind but\nIm sure I mean you know it was just a twoday visit.",
    "I meant originally\nto go off with the coach.",
    "I mean after the two days.",
    "If it hadnt been for\nthis very very tragic accident but well I really felt I couldnt go on any\nlonger.",
    "I thought I must have at least well at least one nights rest.",
    "But I mean it would be so much better if you came to us.",
    "Wed try and\nmake you comfortable.",
    "Oh theres no question of that said Miss Marple.",
    "I was extremely\ncomfortable staying with you.",
    "Oh yes I did enjoy it very much.",

    "And all your things are so nice.",
    "You know your china\n\n\fand glass and furniture.",
    "Its such a pleasure to be in a home and not an\nhotel.",

    "I could go\nand pack your things for you.",
    "Oh well thats very kind of you.",
    "I can do that myself.",
    "Well shall I come and help you\n\nThat would be very kind said Miss Marple.",
    "They repaired to her bedroom where Anthea in a somewhat slapdash\nmanner packed Miss Marples belongings together.",
    "Miss Marple who\nhad her own ways of folding things had to bite her lip to keep an air of\ncomplacency on her face.",
    "Really she thought she cant fold anything\nproperly.",
    "Anthea got hold of a porter from the hotel and he carried the suitcase\nround the corner and down the street to The Old Manor House.",
    "Miss\nMarple tipped him adequately and still uttering fussy little speeches of\nthanks and pleasure rejoined the sisters.",
    "The Three Sisters she was thinking here we are again.",
    "She sat\ndown in the drawing room and closed her eyes for a minute breathing\nrather fast.",
    "She appeared to be somewhat out of breath.",
    "It was only\nnatural she felt at her age and after Anthea and the hotel porter had\nset a fast pace.",
    "But really she was trying to acquire through her closed\neyes what the feeling was she had on coming into this house again.",
    "Was something in it sinister No not so much sinister as unhappy.",
    "Deep unhappiness.",
    "So much so it was almost frightening.",
    "She opened her eyes again and looked at the two other occupants of\nthe room.",
    "Mrs Glynne had just come in from the kitchen bearing an\nafternoon tea tray.",
    "She looked as she had looked all along.",
    "Comfortable no particular emotions or feelings.",
    "Perhaps almost too\ndevoid of them Miss Marple thought.",
    "Had she accustomed herself\nthrough perhaps a life of some stress and difficulty to show nothing to\nthe outer world to keep a reserve and let noone know what her inner\nfeelings were\n\nShe looked from her to Clotilde.",
    "She had a Clytemnestra look as she\nhad thought before.",
    "She had certainly not murdered her husband for\nshe had never had a husband to murder and it seemed unlikely that\nshe had murdered the girl to whom she was said to have been\nextremely attached.",
    "That Miss Marple was quite sure was true.",
    "She\nhad seen before how the tears had welled from Clotildes eyes when\nthe death of Verity had been mentioned.",
    "And what about Anthea Anthea had taken that cardboard box to the\npost office.",
    "Anthea had come to fetch her.",

    "Frightened of those two\nsisters of hers feeling that it was unwise for her to remain at liberty\n\n\fWere they uncertain those two what their sister Anthea might do or\nsay\n\nThere was some atmosphere here.",
    "She wondered as she sipped the\nlast of her tea what Miss Cooke and Miss Barrow were doing.",
    "Had they\ngone to visit that church or was that all talk meaningless talk.",
    "It was\nodd.",
    "Odd the way they had come and looked at her at St Mary Mead so\nas to know her again on the coach but not to acknowledge that they\nhad ever seen or met her before.",
    "There were quite a lot of difficult things going on.",
    "Presently Mrs Glynne\nremoved the tea tray Anthea went out into the garden and Miss Marple\nwas left alone with Clotilde.",

    "Do\nyou know him\n\nOh no said Miss Marple but he did come to the Golden Boar and he\ncame and spoke to me there.",
    "I gather he had been to the hospital and\nwas enquiring about poor Miss Temples death.",
    "He wondered if Miss\nTemple had sent any message to him.",
    "I gather she was thinking of\npaying him a visit.",
    "But of course I told him that although I did go there\nin case I could do anything there was nothing that could be done\nexcept sit by poor Miss Temples bed.",
    "She was unconscious you\nknow.",

    "She thought Clotilde was busy with thoughts of something quite\ndifferent.",
    "Do you think it was an accident Miss Marple asked or do you think\nthere is something in that story that Mrs RiseleyPorters niece told.",
    "About seeing someone pushing a boulder.",
    "Well I suppose if those two said so they must have seen it.",
    "Yes.",
    "They both said so didnt they said Miss Marple though not\nquite in the same terms.",
    "But perhaps thats quite natural.",
    "Clotilde looked at her curiously.",
    "You seem to be intrigued by that.",
    "Well it seems so very unlikely said Miss Marple an unlikely story\nunless \n\nUnless what\n\nWell I just wondered said Miss Marple.",
    "Mrs Glynne came into the room again.",
    "You just wondered what she asked.",
    "Were talking about the accident or the nonaccident said Clotilde.",

    "A parrot that said things\nsilly things that parrots do say and she wrung its neck and Ive never\nfelt the same since.",
    "Ive never felt that I could trust her.",
    "Ive never felt\nsure.",
    "Ive never felt  oh goodness Im getting hysterical too.",
    "Come come said Miss Marple dont think of these things.",
    "No.",
    "Its bad enough to know to know that Verity died.",
    "Died in that\nhorrible way.",
    "At any rate other girls are safe from that boy.",
    "Life\nsentence he got.",
    "Hes still in prison.",
    "They wont let him out to do\nanything to anyone else.",
    "Though why they couldnt bring it in as some\n\n\fmental trouble diminished responsibility one of these things they use\nnowadays.",
    "He ought to have gone to Broadmoor.",
    "Im sure he wasnt\nresponsible for anything that he did.",
    "She got up and went out of the room.",
    "Mrs Glynne had come back and\npassed her sister in the doorway.",
    "You mustnt pay any attention to Clotilde she said.",
    "Shes never\nquite recovered from that ghastly business years ago.",
    "She loved Verity\nvery much.",
    "She seems to be worried about your other sister.",
    "About Anthea Antheas all right.",
    "Shes er well shes scatty you\nknow.",
    "Shes a bit hysterical.",
    "Apt to get worked up about things and\nshe has queer fancies imagination sometimes.",
    "But I dont think theres\nany need for Clotilde to worry so much.",
    "Dear me whos that passing\nthe window\n\nTwo apologetic figures suddenly showed themselves in the french\nwindow.",
    "Oh do excuse us said Miss Barrow we were just walking round the\nhouse to see if we could find Miss Marple.",
    "We had heard shed come\nhere with you and I wonder oh there you are my dear Miss Marple.",
    "I\nwanted to tell you that we didnt get to that church after all this\nafternoon.",
    "Apparently its closed for cleaning so I think we shall have\nto give up any other expedition today and go on one tomorrow.",
    "I do\nhope you dont mind us coming in this way.",
    "I did ring at the frontdoor\nbell but it didnt seem to be ringing.",
    "Im afraid it doesnt sometimes said Mrs Glynne.",
    "You know its\nrather temperamental.",
    "Sometimes it rings and sometimes it doesnt.",
    "But do sit down and talk to us a little.",
    "Id no idea that you hadnt gone\nwith the coach.",
    "No we thought we would do a little sightseeing round here as we\nhad got so far and going with the coach would really be rather well\nrather painful after what has happened just a day or two ago.",
    "You must have some sherry said Mrs Glynne.",
    "She went out of the room and presently returned.",
    "Anthea was with her\nquite calm now bringing glasses and a decanter of sherry and they\nsat down together.",
    "I cant help wanting to know said Mrs Glynne what really is going\nto happen in this business.",
    "I mean of poor Miss Temple.",
    "I mean it\nseems so very impossible to know what the police think.",
    "They still\nseem to be in charge and I mean the inquest being adjourned so\nobviously they are not satisfied.",
    "I dont know if theres anything in the\nnature of the wound.",
    "I shouldnt think so said Miss Barrow.",
    "I mean a blow on the head bad concussion  well I mean that came\nfrom the boulder.",
    "The only point is Miss Marple if the boulder rolled\nitself down or somebody rolled it.",
    "Oh said Miss Cooke but surely you cant think that who on earth\nwould want to roll a boulder down do that sort of thing I suppose\nthere are always hooligans about.",
    "You know some young foreigners\nor students.",
    "I really wonder you know whether well \n\nYou mean said Miss Marple you wondered if that someone was one\nof our fellow travellers.",
    "Well I  I didnt say that said Miss Cooke.",
    "But surely said Miss Marple we cant help  well thinking about\nthat sort of thing.",
    "I mean there must be some explanation.",
    "If the police\nseem sure it wasnt an accident well then it must have been done by\nsomebody and well I mean Miss Temple was a stranger to this place\nhere.",
    "It doesnt seem as if anyone could have done it  anyone local I\nmean.",
    "So it really comes back to.",
    "well I mean to all of us who were in\nthe coach doesnt it\n\nShe gave a faint rather whinnying old ladys laugh.",
    "Oh surely\n\nNo I suppose I ought not to say such things.",
    "But you know really\ncrimes are very interesting.",
    "Sometimes the most extraordinary things\nhave happened.",
    "Have you any definite feeling yourself Miss Marple I should be\ninterested to hear said Clotilde.",
    "Well one does think of possibilities.",
    "Mr Caspar said Miss Cooke.",
    "You know I didnt like the look of that\nman from the first.",
    "He looked to me  well I thought he might have\nsomething to do with espionage or something.",
    "You know perhaps\ncome to this country to look for atomic secrets or something.",
    "I dont think weve got any atomic secrets round here said Mrs\nGlynne.",
    "Of course we havent said Anthea.",
    "Perhaps it was someone who was following her.",
    "Perhaps it was\nsomeone who was tracking her because she was a criminal of some\nkind.",
    "Nonsense said Clotilde.",
    "She was the retired Headmistress of a very\nwell known school she was a very fine scholar.",
    "Why should anyone be\ntrying to track her down\n\nOh I dont know.",
    "She might have gone peculiar or something.",
    "Im sure said Mrs Glynne that Miss Marple has some ideas.",
    "Well I have some ideas said Miss Marple.",
    "It seems to me that  well\nthe only people that could be... Oh dear this is so difficult to say.",
    "But I\nmean there are two people who just spring into ones mind as\npossibilities logically.",
    "I mean I dont think that its really so at all\nbecause Im sure theyre both very nice people but I mean theres\nnobody else really logically who could be suspected should I say.",
    "Who do you mean This is very interesting.",
    "Well I dont think I ought to say such things.",
    "Its only a... sort of wild\nconjecture.",
    "Who do you think might have rolled the boulder down Who do you\nthink could have been the person that Joanna and Emlyn Price saw\n\nWell what I did think was that that perhaps they hadnt seen\nanybody.",
    "I dont quite understand said Anthea they hadnt seen anybody\n\nWell perhaps they might have made it all up.",
    "What about seeing someone\n\nWell its possible isnt it.",
    "Do you mean as a sort of joke or a sort of unkind idea What do you\nmean\n\nWell I suppose one does hear of young people doing very\nextraordinary things nowadays said Miss Marple.",
    "You know putting\nthings in horses eyes smashing Legation windows and attacking\npeople.",
    "Throwing stones at people and its usually being done by\nsomebody young isnt it And they were the only young people\nwerent they\n\n\fYou mean Emlyn Price and Joanna might have rolled over that\nboulder\n\nWell theyre the only sort of obvious people arent they said Miss\nMarple.",
    "Fancy said Clotilde.",
    "Oh I should never have thought of that.",
    "But I\nsee yes I just see that there could be something in what you say.",
    "Of\ncourse I dont know what those two were like.",
    "I havent been travelling\nwith them.",
    "Oh they were very nice said Miss Marple.",
    "Joanna seemed to me a\nparticularly you know capable girl.",
    "Capable of doing anything asked Anthea.",
    "Anthea said Clotilde do be quiet.",
    "Yes.",
    "Quite capable said Miss Marple.",
    "After all if youre going to do\nwhat may result in murder youd have to be rather capable so as to\nmanage not to be seen or anything.",
    "They must have been in it together though suggested Miss Barrow.",
    "Oh yes said Miss Marple.",
    "They were in it together and they told\nroughly the same story.",
    "They are the well they are the obvious\nsuspects thats all I can say.",
    "They were out of sight of the others.",
    "All\nthe other people were on the lower path.",
    "They could have gone up to\nthe top of the hill they could have rocked the boulder.",
    "Perhaps they\ndidnt mean to kill Miss Temple specially.",
    "They may have meant it just\n\n\fas a well just as a piece of anarchy or smashing something or\nsomeone  anyone in fact.",
    "They rolled it over.",
    "And then of course they\ntold the story of seeing someone there.",
    "Some rather peculiar costume\nor other which also sounds very unlikely and well I oughtnt to say\nthese things but I have been thinking about it.",
    "It seems to me a very interesting thought said Mrs Glynne.",
    "What do\nyou think Clotilde\n\nI think its a possibility.",
    "I shouldnt have thought of it myself.",
    "Well said Miss Cooke rising to her feet we must be going back to\nthe Golden Boar now.",
    "Are you coming with us Miss Marple\n\nOh no said Miss Marple.",
    "I suppose you dont know.",
    "Ive forgotten to\ntell you.",
    "Miss BradburyScott very kindly asked me to come back and\nstay another night or two nights here.",
    "Oh I see.",
    "Well Im sure thatll be very nice for you.",
    "Much more\ncomfortable.",
    "They seem rather a noisy lot that have arrived at the\nGolden Boar this evening.",
    "Wont you come round and have some coffee with us after dinner\nsuggested Clotilde.",
    "Its quite a warm evening.",
    "We cant offer you\ndinner because Im afraid we havent got enough in the house but if\nyoull come in and have some coffee with us...\n\nThat would be very nice said Miss Cooke.",
    "Yes we will certainly\navail ourselves of your hospitality.",
    "Chapter 21\n\nTHE CLOCK STRIKES THREE\n\nMiss Cooke and Miss Barrow arrived very promptly at 845.",
    "One wore\nbeige lace and the other one a shade of olive green.",
    "During dinner\nAnthea had asked Miss Marple about these two ladies.",
    "It seems very funny of them she said to want to stay behind.",
    "Oh I dont think so said Miss Marple.",
    "I think it is really quite natural.",
    "They have a rather exact plan I imagine.",
    "What do you mean by a plan asked Mrs Glynne.",
    "Well I should think they are always prepared for various eventualities\nand had a plan for dealing with them.",
    "Do you mean said Anthea with some interest do you mean that\nthey had a plan for dealing with murder\n\nI wish said Mrs Glynne that you wouldnt talk of poor Miss Temples\ndeath as murder.",
    "But of course its murder said Anthea.",
    "All I wonder is who wanted to murder her I should think probably\nsome pupils of hers at the school who always hated her and had it in\nfor her.",
    "Do you think hate can last as long as that asked Miss Marple.",
    "Oh I should think so.",
    "I should think you could hate anyone for years.",
    "No said Miss Marple I think hate would die out.",
    "You could try and\nkeep it up artificially but I think you would fail.",
    "Its not as strong a\nforce as love she added.",
    "Dont you think that Miss Cooke or Miss Barrow or both of them might\nhave done the murder\n\nWhy should they said Mrs Glynne.",
    "Really Anthea They seemed\nvery nice women to me.",
    "I think theres something rather mysterious about them said Anthea.",
    "Dont you Clotilde\n\nI think perhaps youre right said Clotilde.",
    "They seemed to me to be\nslightly artificial if you know what I mean.",
    "I think theres something very sinister about them said Anthea.",
    "Youve got such an imagination always said Mrs Glynne.",
    "Anyway\nthey were walking along the bottom path werent they You saw them\nthere didnt you she said to Miss Marple.",
    "I cant say that I noticed them particularly said Miss Marple.",
    "In fact\nI had no opportunity of doing so.",
    "You mean  \n\nShe wasnt there said Clotilde.",
    "She was here in our garden.",
    "Oh of course.",
    "I forgot.",
    "A very nice peaceful day it was said Miss Marple.",
    "I enjoyed it very\nmuch.",
    "Tomorrow morning I would like to go out and look again at that\nmass of white flowers coming into bloom at the end of the garden near\nthat raised up mound.",
    "It was just beginning to come out the other day.",
    "It must be a mass of bloom now.",
    "I shall always remember that as part\nof my visit here you know.",
    "I hate it said Anthea.",
    "I want it taken away.",
    "I want to build up a\ngreenhouse again there.",
    "Surely if we save enough money we can do\nthat Clotilde\n\nWell leave that alone said Clotilde.",
    "I dont want that touched.",
    "What\nuse is a greenhouse to us now It would be years before grapes would\nbear fruit again.",
    "Come said Mrs Glynne we cant go on arguing over that.",
    "Let us go\ninto the drawing room.",
    "Our guests will be coming shortly for coffee.",
    "It was then that the guests had arrived.",
    "Clotilde brought in the tray of\ncoffee.",
    "She poured out the cups and distributed them.",
    "She placed one\n\n\fbefore each guest and then brought one to Miss Marple.",
    "Miss Cooke\nleaned forward.",
    "Oh do forgive me Miss Marple but really do you know I shouldnt\ndrink that if I were you.",
    "Coffee I mean at this time of night.",
    "You wont\nsleep properly.",
    "Oh do you think so said Miss Marple.",
    "I am quite used to coffee in\nthe evening.",
    "Yes but this is very strong good coffee.",
    "I should advise you not to\ndrink it.",
    "Miss Marple looked at Miss Cooke.",
    "Miss Cookes face was very\nearnest her fair unnaturallooking hair flopped over one eye.",
    "The\nother eye blinked slightly.",
    "I see what you mean said Miss Marple.",
    "Perhaps you are right.",
    "You\nknow something I gather about diet.",
    "Oh yes I make quite a study of it.",
    "I had some training in nursing you\nknow and one thing and another.",
    "Indeed.",
    "Miss Marple pushed the cup away slightly.",
    "I suppose there\nis no photograph of this girl she asked.",
    "Verity Hunt or whatever her\nname was The Archdeacon was talking about her.",
    "He seemed to have\nbeen very fond of her.",
    "I think he was.",
    "He was fond of all young people said Clotilde.",
    "She got up went across the room and lifted the lid of a desk.",
    "From that\nshe brought a photograph and brought it over for Miss Marple to see.",
    "That was Verity she said.",
    "A beautiful face said Miss Marple.",
    "Yes a very beautiful and unusual\nface.",
    "Poor child.",
    "Its dreadful nowadays said Anthea these things seem happening\nthe whole time.",
    "Girls going out with every kind of young man.",
    "Nobody\ntaking any trouble to look after them.",
    "They have to look after themselves nowadays said Clotilde and\ntheyve no idea of how to do it heaven help them\n\nShe stretched out a hand to take back the photograph from Miss\nMarple.",
    "As she did so her sleeve caught the coffee cup and knocked it\nto the floor.",
    "Oh dear said Miss Marple.",
    "Was that my fault Did I jog your arm\n\nNo said Clotilde it was my sleeve.",
    "Its rather a floating sleeve.",
    "Perhaps you would like some hot milk if you are afraid to take coffee\n\nThat would be very kind said Miss Marple.",
    "A glass of hot milk when\nI go to bed would be very soothing indeed and always gives one a\ngood night.",
    "After a little more desultory conversation Miss Cooke and Miss\nBarrow took their departure.",
    "A rather fussy departure in which first\n\n\fone and then the other came back to collect some article theyd left\nbehind.",
    "A scarf a handbag and a pocket handkerchief.",
    "Fuss fuss fuss said Anthea when they had departed.",
    "Somehow said Mrs Glynne I agree with Clotilde that those two\ndont seem real if you know what I mean she said to Miss Marple.",
    "Yes said Miss Marple I do rather agree with you.",
    "They dont seem\nvery real.",
    "I have wondered about them a good deal.",
    "Wondered I mean\nwhy they came on this tour and if they were really enjoying it.",
    "And what\nwas their reason for coming.",
    "And have you discovered the answers to all those things asked\nClotilde.",
    "I think so said Miss Marple.",
    "She sighed.",
    "Ive discovered the\nanswers to a lot of things she said.",
    "Up to now I hope youve enjoyed yourself said Clotilde.",
    "I am glad to have left the tour now said Miss Marple.",
    "I dont think I\nshould have enjoyed much more of it.",
    "No.",
    "I can quite understand that.",
    "Clotilde fetched a glass of hot milk\nfrom the kitchen and accompanied Miss Marple up to her room.",
    "Is there anything else I can get you she asked.",
    "Anything at all\n\n\fNo thank you said Miss Marple.",
    "I have everything I want.",

    "A good brain I should think.",
    "I believe he was a very noted financier.",
    "Financially and otherwise he thought of a lot of things said Miss\nMarple.",
    "Ah well I shall be glad to get to bed.",
    "Goodnight Miss\nBradburyScott.",
    "Shall I send you breakfast up in the morning youd like to have it in\nbed\n\nNo no I wouldnt put you out for the world.",

    "A cup of tea perhaps would be very nice but I want to go\nout in the garden.",
    "I particularly want to see that mound all covered\nwith white flowers so beautiful and so triumphant \n\nGoodnight said Clotilde sleep well.",

    "The clocks in the house did not all\nstrike in unison and some of them indeed did not strike at all.",
    "To keep\na house full of antique clocks in working order was not easy.",
    "At three\noclock the clock on the first floor landing struck a softchimed three\noclock.",
    "A faint chink of light showed through the hinge of the door.",
    "Miss Marple sat up in bed and put her fingers on the switch of the\nelectric lamp by her bed.",

    "Oh dear why not\n\nI did not think it would be very good for me said Miss Marple.",
    "Clotilde stood there at the foot of the bed looking at her.",
    "Not wholesome you know said Miss Marple.",
    "Just what do you mean by that Clotildes voice was harsh now.",
    "I think you know what I mean said Miss Marple.",
    "I think youve\nknown all the evening.",
    "Perhaps before that.",
    "I have no idea what you are talking about.",
    "No There was a faint satirical note to the questioning monosyllable.",
    "I am afraid the milk is cold now.",
    "I will take it away and get you some\nhot.",
    "Clotilde stretched out a hand and took the glass of milk from the\nbedside.",
    "Dont trouble yourself said Miss Marple.",
    "Even if you brought it me I\nshould not drink it.",
    "I really cannot understand the point of what youre saying.",
    "Really\nsaid Clotilde looking at her.",

    "Whom I killed What do you mean\n\nI mean the girl Verity.",
    "And why should I kill her\n\nBecause you loved her said Miss Marple.",

    "It is a frightening word.",
    "You loved Verity too much.",

    "Do you know at all  can you imagine how I have suffered\n\nYes said Miss Marple I can imagine it.",
    "Ive always been able to\nimagine things.",
    "Did you imagine the agony the agony of thinking of knowing you are\ngoing to lose the thing you love best in the world.",
    "And I was losing it to\n\n\fa miserable depraved delinquent.",
    "A man unworthy of my beautiful\nsplendid girl.",
    "I had to stop it.",
    "I had to.",
    "I had to.",
    "Yes said Miss Marple.",
    "Sooner than let the girl go you killed her.",
    "Because you loved her you killed her.",
    "Do you think I could ever do a thing like that Do you think I could\nstrangle the girl I loved Do you think I could bash her face in crush\nher head to a pulp Nothing but a vicious depraved man would do a\nthing like that.",
    "No said Miss Marple you wouldnt do that.",
    "You loved her and you\nwould not be able to do that.",
    "Well then you see you are talking nonsense.",
    "You didnt do that to her.",
    "The girl that happened to was not the girl\nyou loved.",
    "Veritys here still isnt she Shes here in the garden.",
    "I dont\nthink you strangled her.",
    "I think you gave her a drink of coffee or of\nmilk you gave her a painless overdose of sleeping stuff.",
    "And then\nwhen she was dead you took her out into the garden you pulled aside\nthe fallen bricks of the greenhouse and you made a vault for her there\nunder the floor with the bricks and covered it over.",
    "And then the\npolygonum was planted there and has flowered ever since growing\nbigger and stronger every year.",
    "Verity has remained here with you.",
    "You never let her go.",
    "You fool You crazy old fool Do you think you are ever going to get\naway to tell this story\n\n\fI think so said Miss Marple.",
    "Im not quite sure of it.",
    "You are a strong\nwoman a great deal stronger than I am.",
    "Im glad you appreciate that.",
    "And you wouldnt have any scruples said Miss Marple.",
    "You know\none doesnt stop at one murder.",
    "I have noticed that in the course of my\nlife and in what I have observed of crime.",
    "You killed two girls didnt\nyou.",
    "You killed the girl you loved and you killed a different girl.",
    "I killed a silly little tramp an adolescent tart.",
    "Nora Broad.",
    "How did you\nknow about her\n\nI wondered said Miss Marple.",
    "I didnt think from what I saw of you\nthat you could have borne to strangle and disfigure the girl you loved.",
    "But another girl disappeared also about that time a girl whose body\nhas never been found.",
    "But I thought the body had been found only\nthey hadnt known that the body was Nora Broads.",
    "It was dressed in\nVeritys clothes it was identified as Verity by the person who would be\nthe first applied to the person who knew her better than anyone else.",
    "You had to go and say if the body found was the body of Verity.",
    "You\nrecognised it.",
    "You said that that dead body was Veritys.",
    "And why should I do that\n\nBecause you wanted the boy who had taken Verity away from you the\nboy whom Verity had loved and who had loved Verity you wanted him\ntried for murder.",
    "And so you hid that second body in a place where it\nwould not be too easily discovered.",
    "When that was discovered it\nwould be thought to be the wrong girl.",
    "You would make sure that it was\n\n\fidentified in the way you wanted.",
    "You dressed it in Veritys clothes put\nher handbag there a letter or two a bangle a little cross on a chain\nyou disfigured her face.",
    "A week ago you committed a third murder the murder of Elizabeth\nTemple.",
    "You killed her because she was coming to this part of the\nworld and you were afraid of what she might have known from what\nVerity might have written to her or told her and you thought that if\nElizabeth Temple got together with Archdeacon Brabazon they might\nwith what they both knew come at some appraisal of the truth.",
    "Elizabeth Temple must not be allowed to meet the Archdeacon.",
    "You\nare a very powerful woman.",
    "You could have rolled that boulder down\nthe hillside.",
    "It must have taken some doing but you are a very strong\nwoman.",
    "Strong enough to deal with you said Clotilde.",
    "I dont think said Miss Marple that you will be allowed to do that.",
    "What do you mean you miserable shrivelled up old woman\n\nYes said Miss Marple Im an elderly pussy and I have very little\nstrength in my arms or my legs.",
    "Very little strength anywhere.",
    "But I am\nin my own way an emissary of justice.",
    "Clotilde laughed.",
    "And wholl stop me from putting an end to you\n\nI think said Miss Marple my guardian angel.",
    "Trusting to your guardian angel are you said Clotilde and laughed\nagain.",
    "She advanced towards the bed.",
    "Possibly two guardian angels said Miss Marple.",
    "Mr Rafiel always\ndid things on a lavish scale.",
    "Her hand slipped under the pillow and out again.",
    "In it was a whistle\nwhich she put to her lips.",
    "It was something of a sensation in whistles.",
    "It\nhad the shrill fury which would attract a policeman from the end of a\nstreet.",
    "Two things happened almost simultaneously.",
    "The door of the\nroom opened.",
    "Clotilde turned.",
    "Miss Barrow was standing in the\ndoorway.",
    "At the same moment the large wardrobe hanging cupboard\nopened and Miss Cooke stepped out of it.",
    "There was a grim air of\nprofessionalism about them both which was very noticeable in\ncontrast to their pleasant social behaviour a little earlier in the\nevening.",
    "Two guardian angels said Miss Marple happily.",
    "Mr Rafiel has done\nme very proud as one used to say.",
    "Chapter 22\n\nMISS MARPLE TELLS HER STORY\n\nWhen did you find out asked Professor Wanstead that those two\nwomen were private agents accompanying you for your protection\n\n\fHe leaned forward in his chair looking thoughtfully at the whitehaired\nold lady who sat in an upright position in the chair opposite him.",
    "They\nwere in an official Government building in London and there were four\nother persons present.",
    "An official from the Public Prosecutors Office the Assistant\nCommissioner of Scotland Yard Sir James Lloyd the Governor of\nManstone Prison Sir Andrew McNeil.",
    "The fourth person was the Home\nSecretary.",
    "Not until the last evening said Miss Marple.",
    "I wasnt actually sure\nuntil then.",
    "Miss Cooke had come to St Mary Mead and I found out fairly\nquickly that she was not what she represented herself to be which\nwas a woman knowledgeable in gardening who had come there to help\na friend with her garden.",
    "So I was left with the choice of deciding what\nher real object had been once she had acquainted herself with my\nappearance which was obviously the only thing she could have come\nfor.",
    "When I recognised her again on the coach I had to make up my\nmind if she was accompanying the tour in the r\u00f4le of guardianship or\nwhether those two women were enemies enlisted by what I might call\nthe other side.",
    "I was only really sure that last evening when Miss Cooke prevented\nme by very distinct words of warning from drinking the cup of coffee\nthat Clotilde BradburyScott had just set down in front of me.",
    "She\nphrased it very cleverly but the warning was clearly there.",
    "Later\nwhen I was wishing those two goodnight one of them took my hand in\nboth of hers giving me a particularly friendly and affectionate\nhandshake.",
    "And in doing so she passed something into my hand\n\n\fwhich when I examined it later I found to be a highpowered whistle.",
    "I\ntook it to bed with me accepted the glass of milk which was urged\nupon me by my hostess and wished her goodnight being careful not\nto change my simple and friendly attitude.",
    "You didnt drink the milk\n\nOf course not said Miss Marple.",
    "What do you take me for\n\nI beg your pardon said Professor Wanstead.",
    "It surprises me that\nyou didnt lock your door.",
    "That would have been quite the wrong thing to do said Miss Marple.",
    "I wanted Clotilde BradburyScott to come in.",
    "I wanted to see what she\nwould say or do.",
    "I thought it was almost certain that she would come in\nwhen sufficient time had elapsed to make sure that I had drunk the\nmilk and was in an unconscious sleep from which presumably I would\nnot have woken up again.",
    "Did you help Miss Cooke to conceal herself in the wardrobe\n\nNo.",
    "It was a complete surprise when she came out of that suddenly.",
    "I\nsuppose said Miss Marple thoughtfully thinking it over I suppose\nshe slipped in there just when I had gone down the passage to the  er to the bathroom.",
    "You knew the two women were in the house\n\nI thought they would be at hand somewhere after theyd given me the\nwhistle.",
    "I do not think it was a difficult house to which to gain access\n\n\fthere were no shuttered windows or burglar alarms or anything of that\nkind.",
    "One of them came back on the pretext of having left a handbag\nand a scarf.",
    "Between them they probably managed to leave a window\nunfastened and I should imagine they came back into the house\nalmost as soon as they left it while the inhabitants inside were going\nup to bed.",
    "You took a big risk Miss Marple.",
    "I hoped for the best said Miss Marple.",
    "One cannot go through life\nwithout attracting certain risks if they are necessary.",
    "Your tip about the parcel dispatched to that charity by the way was\nentirely successful.",
    "It contained a brand new brightly coloured mans\npolonecked jumper in scarlet and black checks.",
    "Most noticeable.",
    "What made you think of that\n\nWell said Miss Marple that was really very simple.",
    "The description\nthat Emlyn and Joanna gave of the figure they had seen made it seem\nalmost certain that these very bright coloured and noticeable clothes\nwere meant to be noticed and that therefore it would be very\nimportant that they should not be hidden locally or kept among the\npersons own belongings.",
    "They must be got out of the way as soon as\ncould be.",
    "And really there is only one way successfully of disposing of\nsomething.",
    "That is through the general post.",
    "Anything in the nature of\nclothes can be very easily dispatched to charities.",
    "Think how pleased\nthe people who collect winter garments for Unemployed Mothers or\nwhatever the name of the charity would be to find a nearly brand new\nwoollen jumper.",
    "All I had to do was to find out the address where it had\nbeen sent.",
    "And you asked them that at the post office The Home Secretary\nlooked slightly shocked.",
    "Not directly of course.",
    "I mean I had to be a little flustered and\nexplain how Id put the wrong address on some clothes that I was\nsending to a charity and could they by any chance tell me if the parcel\none of my kind hostesses had brought up there had been sent off.",
    "And\na very nice woman there did her best and remembered that it was not\nthe address I was hoping it had been sent to and she gave me the\naddress that she had noted.",
    "She had no suspicion I think that I had\nany wish for the information apart from being well rather muddleheaded elderly and very worried about where my parcel of worn\nclothes had gone.",
    "Ah said Professor Wanstead I see you are an actress Miss Marple\nas well as an avenger.",
    "Then he said When did you first begin to\ndiscover what had happened ten years ago\n\nTo begin with said Miss Marple I found things very difficult almost\nimpossible.",
    "In my mind I was blaming Mr Rafiel for not having made\nthings clear to me.",
    "But I see now that hed been very wise not to do so.",
    "Really you know he was extraordinarily clever.",
    "I can see why he was\nsuch a big financier and made so much money so easily.",
    "He laid his\nplans so well.",
    "He gave me just enough information in small packets\neach time.",
    "I was as it were directed.",
    "First my guardian angels were\nalerted to note what I looked like.",
    "Then I was directed on the tour and\nto the people on it.",
    "Did you suspect if I may use that word anyone on the tour at first\n\n\fOnly as possibilities.",
    "No feeling of evil\n\nAh you have remembered that.",
    "No I did not think there was any\ndefinite atmosphere of evil.",
    "I was not told who my contact was there\nbut she made herself known to me.",
    "Elizabeth Temple\n\nYes.",
    "It was like a searchlight said Miss Marple illuminating things\non a dark night.",
    "So far you see I had been in the dark.",
    "There were\ncertain things that must be must logically be I mean because of what\nMr Rafiel had indicated.",
    "There must be somewhere a victim and\nsomewhere a murderer.",
    "Yes a killer was indicated because that was\nthe only liaison that had existed between Mr Rafiel and myself.",
    "There\nhad been a murder in the West Indies.",
    "Both he and I had been involved\nin it and all he knew of me was my connection with that.",
    "So it could not\nbe any other type of crime.",
    "And it could not either be a casual crime.",
    "It must be a deliberate crime.",
    "It must be and show itself definitely to\nbe the handiwork of someone who had accepted evil.",
    "Evil instead of\ngood.",
    "There seemed to be two victims indicated.",
    "There must be\nsomeone who had been killed and there must be clearly a victim of\ninjustice.",
    "A victim who had been accused of a crime he or she had not\ncommitted.",
    "So now while I pondered these things I had no light upon\nthem until I talked to Miss Temple.",
    "She was very intense very\ncompelling.",
    "There came the first link which I had with Mr Rafiel.",
    "She\nspoke of a girl she had known a girl who had once been engaged to Mr\nRafiels son.",
    "Here then was my first ray of light.",
    "Presently she also told\n\n\fme that the girl had not married him.",
    "I asked why not and she said\nbecause she died.",
    "I asked then how she died what had killed her and\nshe said very strongly very compellingly I can hear her voice still it\nwas like the sound of a deep bell she said Love.",
    "And she said after\nthat the most frightening word there can be is Love.",
    "I did not know\nthen exactly what she meant.",
    "In fact the first idea that came to me was\nthat the girl had committed suicide as a result of an unhappy love\naffair.",
    "It can happen often enough and a very sad tragedy it is when it\ndoes happen.",
    "That was the most I knew then.",
    "That and the fact that the\njourney she herself was engaged upon was no mere pleasure tour.",
    "She\nwas going she told me on a pilgrimage.",
    "She was going to some place\nor to some person.",
    "I did not learn then who the person was that only\ncame later.",
    "Archdeacon Brabazon\n\nYes.",
    "I had no idea then of his existence.",
    "But from then on I felt that the\nchief characters the chief actors in the drama whichever way you like\nto put it were not on the tour.",
    "They were not members of the coach\nparty.",
    "I hesitated just for a short time hesitated over some particular\npersons.",
    "I hesitated considering Joanna Crawford and Emlyn Price.",
    "Why fix on them\n\nBecause of their youth said Miss Marple.",
    "Because youth is so often\nassociated with suicide with violence with intense jealousy and tragic\nlove.",
    "A man kills his girl  it happens.",
    "Yes my mind went to them but it\ndid not seem to me there was any association there.",
    "No shadow of evil\nof despair of misery.",
    "I used the idea of them later as a kind of false\npointer when we were drinking sherry at The Old Manor House that\n\n\flast evening.",
    "I pointed out how they could be the most easy suspects in\nthe death of Elizabeth Temple.",
    "When I see them again said Miss\nMarple punctiliously I shall apologise to them for having used them\nas useful characters to distract attention from my real ideas.",
    "And the next thing was the death of Elizabeth Temple\n\nNo said Miss Marple.",
    "Actually the next thing was my arrival at The\nOld Manor House.",
    "The kindness of my reception and taking up my stay\nthere under their hospitable roof.",
    "That again had been arranged by Mr\nRafiel.",
    "So I knew that I must go there but not for what reason I was to\ngo there.",
    "It might be merely a place where more information would\ncome to me to lead me onwards in my quest.",
    "I am sorry Miss Marple\nsaid suddenly becoming her normal apologetic and slightly fussy self\nI am talking at much too great a length.",
    "I really must not inflict on you\nall that I thought and...",
    "Please go on said Professor Wanstead.",
    "You may not know it but\nwhat you are telling me is particularly interesting to me.",
    "It ties up with\nso much I have known and seen in the work I do.",
    "Go on giving me what\nyou felt.",
    "Yes go on said Sir Andrew McNeil.",
    "It was feeling said Miss Marple.",
    "It wasnt really you know logical\ndeduction.",
    "It was based on a kind of emotional reaction or\nsusceptibility to well I can only call it atmosphere.",
    "Yes said Wanstead there is atmosphere.",
    "Atmosphere in houses\natmosphere in places in the garden in the forest in a public house in\na cottage.",
    "The three sisters.",
    "That is what I thought and felt and said to myself\nwhen I went into The Old Manor House.",
    "I was so kindly received by\nLavinia Glynne.",
    "Theres something about the phrase  the three sisters\nthat springs up in your mind as sinister.",
    "It combines with the three\nsisters in Russian literature the three witches on Macbeths heath.",
    "It\nseemed to me that there was an atmosphere there of sorrow of deep\nfelt unhappiness also an atmosphere of fear and a kind of struggling\ndifferent atmosphere which I can only describe as an atmosphere of\nnormality.",
    "Your last word interests me said Wanstead.",
    "It was due I think to Mrs Glynne.",
    "She was the one who came to meet\nme when the coach arrived and explained the invitation.",
    "She was an\nentirely normal and pleasant woman a widow.",
    "She was not very\nhappy but when I say she was not very happy it was nothing to do with\nsorrow or deep unhappiness it was just that she had the wrong\natmosphere for her own character.",
    "She took me back with her and I\nmet the other two sisters.",
    "The next morning I was to hear from an aged\nhousemaid who brought my early morning tea a story of past tragedy\nof a girl who had been killed by her boyfriend.",
    "Of several other girls in\nthe neighbourhood whod fallen victims to violence or sexual assault.",
    "I\nhad to make my second appraisal.",
    "I had dismissed the people in the\ncoach as not being personally concerned in my search.",
    "Somewhere\nstill there was a killer.",
    "I had to ask myself if one of the killers could be\nhere.",
    "Here in this house where I had been sent Clotilde Lavinia\n\n\fAnthea.",
    "Three names of three weird sisters  three happy  unhappy\nsuffering  frightened what were they My attention was caught first by\nClotilde.",
    "A tall handsome woman.",
    "A personality.",
    "Just as Elizabeth\nTemple had been a personality.",
    "I felt that here where the field was\nlimited I must at least sum up what I could about the three sisters.",
    "Three Fates.",
    "Who could be a killer What kind of a killer What kind of\na killing I could feel then rising up rather slowly rather slowly like a\nmiasma does an atmosphere.",
    "I dont think there is any other word that\nexpresses it except evil.",
    "Not necessarily that any one of these three\nwas evil but they were certainly living in an atmosphere where evil\nhad happened had left its shadow or was still threatening them.",
    "Clotilde the eldest was the first one I considered.",
    "She was handsome\nshe was strong she was I thought a woman of intense emotional\nfeeling.",
    "I saw her I will admit as a possible Clytemnestra.",
    "I had\nrecently Miss Marple dropped into her everyday tones been taken\nvery kindly to a Greek play performed at a wellknown boys public\nschool not far from my home.",
    "I had been very very impressed by the\nacting of the Agamemnon and particularly the performance of the boy\nwho had played Clytemnestra.",
    "A very remarkable performance.",
    "It\nseemed to me that in Clotilde I could imagine a woman who could plan\nand carry out the killing of a husband in his bath.",
    "For a moment Professor Wanstead had all he could do to repress a\nlaugh.",
    "It was the seriousness of Miss Marples tone.",
    "She gave him a\nslight twinkle from her eyes.",
    "Yes it sounds rather silly does it not said like that But I could see\nher that way playing that part that is to say.",
    "Very unfortunately she\nhad no husband.",
    "She had never had a husband and therefore did not\nkill a husband.",
    "Then I considered my guide to the house Lavinia\n\n\fGlynne.",
    "She seemed an extremely nice wholesome and pleasant\nwoman.",
    "But alas certain people who have killed have produced much\nthat effect on the world round them.",
    "They have been charming people.",
    "Many murderers have been delightful and pleasant men and people\nhave been astonished.",
    "They are what I call the respectable killers.",
    "The\nones who would commit murder from entirely utilitarian motives.",
    "Without emotion but to gain a required end.",
    "I didnt think it was very\nlikely and I should be highly surprised if it was so but I could not leave\nout Mrs Glynne.",
    "She had had a husband.",
    "She was a widow and had\nbeen a widow for some years.",
    "It could be.",
    "I left it at that.",
    "And then I\ncame to the third sister Anthea.",
    "She was a disquieting personality.",
    "Badly coordinated it seemed to me scatterbrained and in a\ncondition of some emotion which I thought on the whole was fear.",
    "She\nwas frightened of something.",
    "Intensely frightened of something.",
    "Well\nthat could fit in too.",
    "If she had committed a crime of some kind a crime\nwhich she had thought was finished with and past there might have\nbeen some recrudescence some raising up of old problems\nsomething perhaps connected with the Elizabeth Temple enquiries\nshe might have felt fear that an old crime would be revived or\ndiscovered.",
    "She had a curious way of looking at you and then looking\nsharply from side to side over one shoulder as though she saw\nsomething standing behind her.",
    "Something that made her afraid.",
    "So\nshe too was a possible answer.",
    "A possibly slightly mentally unhinged\nkiller who could have killed because she considered herself\npersecuted.",
    "Because she was afraid.",
    "These were only ideas.",
    "They\nwere only a rather more pronounced assessment of possbilities that I\nhad already gone through on the coach.",
    "But the atmosphere of the\nhouse was on me more than ever.",
    "That next day I walked in the garden\nwith Anthea.",
    "At the end of the principal grass path was a mound.",
    "A\nmound created by the falling down of a former greenhouse.",
    "Owing to a\n\n\flack of repairs and of gardeners at the end of the war it had fallen into\ndisuse come to pieces bricks had been piled up surmounted with\nearth and turf and had been planted with a certain creeper.",
    "A creeper\nwell known when you want to hide or cover some rather ugly pieces of\nbuilding in your garden.",
    "Polygonum it is called.",
    "One of the quickest\nflowering shrubs which swallows and kills and dries up and gets rid of\neverything it grows over.",
    "It grows over everything.",
    "It is in a way a\nrather frightening plant.",
    "It has beautiful white flowers it can look very\nlovely.",
    "It was not yet in bloom but it was going to be.",
    "I stood there with\nAnthea and she seemed to be desperately unhappy over the loss of\nthe greenhouse.",
    "She said it had had such lovely grapes it seemed to\nbe the thing she remembered most about the garden when she had\nbeen a child there.",
    "And she wanted she wanted desperately to have\nenough money so as to dig up the mound level the ground and rebuild\nthe greenhouse and stock it with muscat grapes and peaches as the\nold greenhouse had been.",
    "It was a terrible nostalgia for the past she\nwas feeling.",
    "It was more than that.",
    "Again very clearly I felt an\natmosphere of fear.",
    "Something about the mound made her frightened.",
    "I couldnt then think what it was.",
    "You know the next thing that\nhappened.",
    "It was Elizabeth Temples death and there was no doubt\nfrom the story told by Emlyn Price and Joanna Crawford that there\ncould be only one conclusion.",
    "It was not accident.",
    "It was deliberate\nmurder.",
    "I think it was from then on said Miss Marple that I knew.",
    "I came to\nthe conclusion there had been three killings.",
    "I heard the full story of Mr\nRafiels son the delinquent boy the exjailbird and I thought that he\nwas all those things but none of them showed him as being a killer or\nlikely to be a killer.",
    "All the evidence was against him.",
    "There was no\ndoubt in anyones mind that he had killed the girl whose name I had\n\n\fnow learned as being Verity Hunt.",
    "But Archdeacon Brabazon put the\nfinal crown on the business as it were.",
    "He had known those two young\npeople.",
    "They had come to him with their story of wanting to get\nmarried and he had taken it upon himself to decide that they should\nget married.",
    "He thought that it was not perhaps a wise marriage but it\nwas a marriage that was justified by the fact that they both loved each\nother.",
    "The girl loved the boy with what he called a true love.",
    "A love as\ntrue as her name.",
    "And he thought that the boy for all his bad sexual\nreputation had truly loved the girl and had every intention of being\nfaithful to her and trying to reform some of his evil tendencies.",
    "The\nArchdeacon was not optimistic.",
    "He did not I think believe it would be\na thoroughly happy marriage but it was to his mind what he called a\nnecessary marriage.",
    "Necessary because if you love enough you will\npay the price even if the price is disappointment and a certain amount\nof unhappiness.",
    "But one thing I was quite sure of.",
    "That disfigured face\nthat batteredin head could not have been the action of a boy who\nreally loved the girl.",
    "This was not a story of sexual assault.",
    "In this love\naffair the love was rooted in tenderness.",
    "I was ready to take the\nArchdeacons word for that.",
    "But I knew too that Id got the right clue\nthe clue that was given me by Elizabeth Temple.",
    "She had said that the\ncause of Veritys death was Love one of the most frightening words\nthere is.",
    "It was quite clear then said Miss Marple.",
    "I think Id known for some\ntime really.",
    "It was just the small things that hadnt fitted in but now\nthey did.",
    "They fitted in with what Elizabeth Temple had said.",
    "The cause\nof Veritys death.",
    "She had said first the one word Love and then that\nLove could be the most frightening word there was.",
    "It was all mapped\nout so plainly then.",
    "The overwhelming love that Clotilde had had for\nthis girl.",
    "The girls heroworship of her dependency on her and then\n\n\fas she grew a little older her normal instincts came into play.",
    "She\nwanted Love.",
    "She wanted to be free to love to marry to have children.",
    "And along came the boy that she could love.",
    "She knew that he was\nunreliable she knew he was what was technically called a bad lot but\nthat said Miss Marple in a more ordinary tone of voice is not what\nputs any girl off a boy.",
    "No.",
    "Young women like bad lots.",
    "They always\nhave.",
    "They fall in love with bad lots.",
    "They are quite sure they can\nchange them.",
    "And the nice kind steady reliable husbands got the\nanswer in my young days that one would be a sister to them which\nnever satisfied them at all.",
    "Verity fell in love with Michael Rafiel and\nMichael Rafiel was prepared to turn over a new leaf and marry this girl\nand was sure he would never wish to look at another girl again.",
    "I dont\nsay this would have been a happyeverafter thing but it was as the\nArchdeacon said quite surely it was real love.",
    "And so they planned to\nget married.",
    "And I think Verity wrote to Elizabeth and told her that she\nwas going to marry Michael Rafiel.",
    "It was arranged in secret because I\nthink Verity did realise that what she was doing was essentially an\nescape.",
    "She was escaping from a life that she didnt want to live any\nlonger from someone whom she loved very much but not in the way\nshe loved Michael.",
    "And she would not be allowed to do so.",
    "Permission\nwould not be willingly given every obstacle would be put in their way.",
    "So like other young people they were going to elope.",
    "There was no\nneed for them to fly off to Gretna Green they were of sufficiently\nmature age to marry.",
    "So she appealed to Archdeacon Brabazon her\nold friend who had confirmed her  who was a real friend.",
    "And the\nwedding was arranged the day the time probably even she bought\nsecretly some garment in which to be married.",
    "They were to meet\nsomewhere no doubt.",
    "They were to come to the rendezvous\nseparately.",
    "I think he came there but she did not come.",
    "He waited\nperhaps.",
    "Waited and then tried to find out perhaps why she didnt\n\n\fcome.",
    "I think then a message may have been given him even a letter.",
    "Sent him possibly in her forged handwriting saying she had changed\nher mind.",
    "It was all over and she was going away for a time to get over\nit.",
    "I dont know.",
    "But I dont think he ever dreamt of the real reason of\nwhy she hadnt come of why she had sent no word.",
    "He hadnt thought\nfor one moment that she had been deliberately cruelly almost madly\nperhaps destroyed.",
    "Clotilde was not going to lose the person she\nloved.",
    "She was not going to let her escape she was not going to let her\ngo to the young man whom she herself hated and loathed.",
    "She would\nkeep Verity keep her in her own way.",
    "But what I could not believe\nwas...",
    "I did not believe that shed strangled the girl and had then\ndisfigured her face.",
    "I dont think she could have borne to do that.",
    "I\nthink that she had rearranged the bricks of the fallen greenhouse and\npiled up earth and turf over most of it.",
    "The girl had already been given\na drink an overdose of sleeping draught probably.",
    "Grecian as it were\nin tradition.",
    "One cup of hemlock  even if it wasnt hemlock.",
    "And she\nburied the girl there in the garden piled the bricks over her and the\nearth and the turf \n\nDid neither of the other sisters suspect it\n\nMrs Glynne was not there then.",
    "Her husband had not died and she\nwas still abroad.",
    "But Anthea was there.",
    "I think Anthea did know\nsomething of what went on.",
    "I dont know that she suspected death at\nfirst but she knew that Clotilde had been occupying herself with the\nraising up of a mound at the end of the garden to be covered with\nflowering shrubs to be a place of beauty.",
    "I think perhaps the truth\ncame to her little by little.",
    "And then Clotilde having accepted evil\ndone evil surrendered to evil had no qualms about what she would do\nnext.",
    "I think she enjoyed planning it.",
    "She had a certain amount of\n\n\finfluence over a sly sexy little village girl who came to her cadging for\nbenefits now and then.",
    "I think it was easy for her to arrange one day to\ntake the girl on a picnic or an expedition a good long way away.",
    "Thirty\nor forty miles.",
    "Shed chosen the place beforehand I think.",
    "She\nstrangled the girl disfigured her hid her under turned earth leaves\nand branches.",
    "Why should anyone ever suspect her of doing any such\nthing She put Veritys handbag there and a little chain Verity used to\nwear round her neck and possibly dressed her in clothes belonging to\nVerity.",
    "She hoped the crime would not be found out for some time but\nin the meantime she spread abroad rumours of Nora Broad having\nbeen seen about in Michaels car going about with Michael.",
    "Possibly\nshe spread a story that Verity had broken off the engagement to be\nmarried because of his infidelity with this girl.",
    "She may have said\nanything and I think everything she said she enjoyed poor lost soul.",
    "Why do you say poor lost soul Miss Marple\n\nBecause said Miss Marple I dont suppose there can be any agony\nso great as what Clotilde has suffered all this time ten years now living\nin eternal sorrow.",
    "Living you see with the thing she had to live with.",
    "She had kept Verity kept her there at The Old Manor House n the\ngarden kept her there for ever.",
    "She didnt realise at first what that\nmeant.",
    "Her passionate longing for the girl to be alive again.",
    "I dont\nthink she ever suffered from remorse.",
    "I dont think she had even that\nconsolation.",
    "She just suffered  went on suffering year after year.",
    "And I\nknow now what Elizabeth Temple meant.",
    "Better perhaps than she\nherself did.",
    "Love is a very terrible thing.",
    "It is alive to evil it can be one\nof the most evil things there can be.",
    "And she had to live with that day\nafter day year after year.",
    "I think you know that Anthea was\nfrightened of that.",
    "I think she knew more clearly the whole time what\n\n\fClotilde had done and she thought that Clotilde knew that she knew.",
    "And she was afraid of what Clotilde might do.",
    "Clotilde gave that parcel\nto Anthea to post the one with the pullover.",
    "She said things to me\nabout Anthea that she was mentally disturbed that if she suffered\nfrom persecution or jealousy Anthea might do anything.",
    "I think yes that\nin the not so distant future something might have happened to Anthea\nan arranged suicide because of a guilty conscience \n\nAnd yet you are sorry for that woman asked Sir Andrew.",
    "Malignant\nevil is like cancer a malignant tumour.",
    "It brings suffering.",
    "Of course said Miss Marple.",
    "I suppose you have been told what happened that night said\nProfessor Wanstead after your guardian angels had removed you\n\nYou mean Clotilde She had picked up my glass of milk I remember.",
    "She was still holding it when Miss Cooke took me out of the room.",
    "I\nsuppose she drank it did she\n\nYes.",
    "Did you know that might happen\n\nI didnt think of it no not at the moment.",
    "I suppose I could have\nknown it if Id thought about it.",
    "Nobody could have stopped her.",
    "She was so quick about it and\nnobody quite realised there was anything wrong in the milk.",
    "So she drank it.",
    "Does that surprise you\n\nNo it would have seemed to her the natural thing to do one cant\nreally wonder.",
    "It had come by this time that she wanted to escape from\nall the things she was having to live with.",
    "Just as Verity had wanted to\nescape from the life that she was living there.",
    "Very odd isnt it that the\nretribution one brings on oneself fits so closely with what has caused\nit.",
    "You sound sorrier for her than you were for the girl who died.",
    "No said Miss Marple its a different kind of being sorry.",
    "Im sorry\nfor Verity because of all that she missed all that she was so near to\nobtaining.",
    "A life of love and devotion and service to the man she had\nchosen and whom she truly loved.",
    "Truly and in all verity.",
    "She missed\nall that and nothing can give that back to her.",
    "Im sorry for her because\nof what she didnt have.",
    "But she escaped what Clotilde had to suffer.",
    "Sorrow misery fear and a growing cultivation and imbibing of evil.",
    "Clotilde had to live with all those.",
    "Sorrow frustrated love which she\ncould never get back she had to live with the two sisters who\nsuspected who were afraid of her and she had to live with the girl she\nhad kept there.",
    "You mean Verity\n\nYes.",
    "Buried in the garden buried in the tomb that Clotilde had\nprepared.",
    "She was there in The Old Manor House and I think Clotilde\nknew she was there.",
    "It might be that she even saw her or thought she\nsaw her sometimes when she went to pick a spray of polygonum\n\n\fblossom.",
    "She must have felt very close to Verity then.",
    "Nothing worse\ncould happen to her could it than that Nothing worse...\n\nChapter 23\n\nEND PIECES\n\nThat old lady gives me the creeps said Sir Andrew McNeil when he\nhad said goodbye and thanks to Miss Marple.",
    "So gentle and so ruthless said the Assistant Commissioner.",
    "Professor Wanstead took Miss Marple down to his car which was\nwaiting and then returned for a few final words.",
    "What do you think of her Edmund\n\nThe most frightening woman I ever met said the Home Secretary.",
    "Ruthless asked Professor Wanstead.",
    "No no I dont mean that but well a very frightening woman.",
    "Nemesis said Professor Wanstead thoughtfully.",
    "Those two women said the P.P.D.",
    "man you know the security\nagents who were looking after her they gave a most extraordinary\ndescription of her that night.",
    "They got into the house quite easily hid\nthemselves in a small downstairs room until everyone went upstairs\nthen one went into the bedroom and into the wardrobe and the other\nstayed outside the room to watch.",
    "The one in the bedroom said that\nwhen she threw open the door of the wardrobe and came out there\nwas the old lady sitting up in bed with a pink fluffy shawl round her\nneck and a perfectly placid face twittering away and talking like an\nelderly school marm.",
    "They said she gave them quite a turn.",
    "A pink fluffy shawl said Professor Wanstead.",
    "Yes yes I do\nremember \n\nWhat do you remember\n\nOld Rafiel.",
    "He told me about her you know and then he laughed.",
    "He\nsaid one thing hed never forget in all his life.",
    "He said it was when one\nof the funniest scatterbrained old pussies hed ever met came\nmarching into his bedroom out in the West Indies with a fluffy pink\nscarf round her neck telling him he was to get up and do something to\nprevent a murder.",
    "And he said What on earth do you think youre\ndoing And she said she was Nemesis.",
    "Nemesis He could not imagine\nanything less like it he said.",
    "I like the touch of the pink woolly scarf\nsaid Professor Wanstead thoughtfully I like that very much.",
    "II\n\n\fMichael said Professor Wanstead I want to introduce you to Miss\nJane Marple whos been very active on your behalf.",
    "The young man of thirtytwo looked at the whitehaired rather dicky\nold lady with a slightly doubtful expression.",
    "Oh er he said well I guess I have heard about it.",
    "Thanks very\nmuch.",
    "He looked at Wanstead.",
    "Its true is it theyre going to give me a free pardon or something silly\nlike that\n\nYes.",
    "A release will be put through quite soon.",
    "Youll be a free man in a\nvery short time.",
    "Oh.",
    "Michael sounded slightly doubtful.",
    "It will take a little getting used to I expect said Miss Marple kindly.",
    "She looked at him thoughtfully.",
    "Seeing him in retrospect as he might\nhave been ten years or so ago.",
    "Still quite attractive though he showed\nall the signs of strain.",
    "Attractive yes.",
    "Very attractive she thought he\nwould have been once.",
    "A gaiety about him then there would have\nbeen and a charm.",
    "Hed lost that now but it would come back\nperhaps.",
    "A weak mouth and attractively shaped eyes that could look\nyou straight in the face and probably had been always extremely\n\n\fuseful for telling lies that you really wanted to believe.",
    "Very like  who\nwas it  she dived into past memories.",
    "Jonathan Birkin of course.",
    "He\nhad sung in the choir.",
    "A really delightful baritone voice.",
    "And how fond\nthe girls had been of him Quite a good job hed had as clerk in Messrs\nGabriels firm.",
    "A pity there had been that little matter of the cheques.",
    "Oh said Michael.",
    "He said with even more embarrassment Its been\nvery kind of you Im sure to take so much trouble.",
    "Ive enjoyed it said Miss Marple.",
    "Well Im glad to have met you.",
    "Goodbye.",
    "I hope youve got a very good time coming to you.",
    "Our\ncountry is in rather a bad way just now but youll probably find some\njob or other that you might quite enjoy doing.",
    "Oh yes.",
    "Thanks thanks very much.",
    "I really am very grateful you\nknow.",
    "His tone sounded still extremely unsure about it.",
    "Its not me you ought to be grateful to said Miss Marple you ought\nto be grateful to your father.",
    "Dad Dad never thought much of me.",
    "Your father when he was a dying man was determined to see that\nyou got justice.",
    "Justice.",
    "Michael Rafiel considered it.",
    "Yes your father thought Justice was important.",
    "He was I think a very\njust man himself.",
    "In the letter he wrote me asking me to undertake this\nproposition he directed me to a quotation\n\nLet Justice roll down like waters\n\nAnd Righteousness like an everlasting stream.",
    "Oh Whats it mean Shakespeare\n\nNo the Bible.",
    "One has to think about it  I had to.",
    "Miss Marple unwrapped a parcel she had been carrying.",
    "They gave me this she said.",
    "They thought I might like to have it\nbecause I had helped to find out the truth of what had really happened.",
    "I think though that you are the person who should have first claim on\nit that is if you really want it.",
    "But maybe you do not want it \n\nShe handed him the photograph of Verity Hunt that Clotilde BradburyScott had shown her once in the drawing room of The Old Manor\nHouse.",
    "He took it and stood with it staring down on it... His face changed the\nlines of it softened then hardened.",
    "Miss Marple watched him without\nspeaking.",
    "The silence went on for some little time.",
    "Professor Wanstead\nalso watched he watched them both the old lady and the boy.",
    "It came to him that this was in some way a crisis a moment that might\naffect a whole new way of life.",
    "Michael Rafiel sighed... he stretched out and gave the photograph\nback to Miss Marple.",
    "No you are right I do not want it.",
    "All that life is gone  shes gone  I\ncant keep her with me.",
    "Anything I do now has got to be new  going\nforward.",
    "You  he hesitated looking at her.",
    "You understand\n\nYes said Miss Marple.",
    "I understand...",
    "I think you are right.",
    "I wish\nyou good luck in the life you are now going to begin.",
    "He said goodbye and went out.",
    "Well said Professor Wanstead not an enthusiastic young man.",
    "He\ncould have thanked you a bit more enthusiastically for what you did for\nhim.",
    "Oh thats quite all right said Miss Marple.",
    "I didnt expect him to do\nso.",
    "It would have embarrassed him even more.",
    "It is you know she\nadded very embarrassing when one has to thank people and start life\nagain and see everything from a different angle and all that.",
    "I think he\nmight do well.",
    "Hes not bitter.",
    "Thats the great thing.",
    "I understand quite\nwell why that girl loved him.",
    "Well perhaps hell go straight this time.",
    "One rather doubts that said Miss Marple.",
    "I dont know that hed be\nable to help himself unless of course she said the great thing to\nhope for is that hell meet a really nice girl.",
    "What I like about you said Professor Wanstead is your delightfully\npractical mind.",
    "III\n\nShell be here presently said Mr Broadribb to Mr Schuster.",
    "Yes.",
    "The whole things pretty extraordinary isnt it\n\nI couldnt believe it at first said Broadribb.",
    "You know when poor\nold Rafiel was dying I thought this whole thing was well senility or\nsomething.",
    "Not that he was old enough for that.",
    "The buzzer went.",
    "Mr Schuster picked up the phone.",
    "Oh shes here is she Bring her up he said.",
    "Shes come he said.",
    "I wonder now.",
    "You know its the oddest thing I ever heard in my life.",
    "Getting an old lady to go racketing round the countryside looking for\nshe doesnt know what.",
    "The police think you know that that woman\ncommitted not just one murder but three.",
    "Three I ask you Verity\nHunts body was under the mound in the garden just as the old lady\nsaid it was.",
    "She hadnt been strangled and the face was not\ndisfigured.",
    "I wonder the old lady herself didnt get done in said Mr Broadribb.",
    "Far too old to be able to take care of herself.",
    "She had a couple of detectives apparently looking after her.",
    "What two of them\n\nYes I didnt know that.",
    "Miss Marple was ushered into their room.",
    "Congratulations Miss Marple said Mr Broadribb rising to greet her.",
    "Very best wishes.",
    "Splendid job said Mr Schuster shaking hands.",
    "Miss Marple sat down composedly on the other side of the desk.",
    "As I told you in my letter she said I think I have fulfilled the terms of\nthe proposition that was made to me.",
    "I have succeeded in what I was\nasked to do.",
    "Oh I know.",
    "Yes weve heard already.",
    "Weve heard from Professor\nWanstead and from the legal department and from the police\nauthorities.",
    "Yes its been a splendid job Miss Marple.",
    "We congratulate\nyou.",
    "I was afraid said Miss Marple that I would not be able to do what\nwas required of me.",
    "It seemed so very difficult almost impossible at\nfirst.",
    "Yes indeed.",
    "It seems quite impossible to me.",
    "I dont know how you did\nit Miss Marple.",
    "Oh well said Miss Marple its just perseverance isnt it that leads\nto things.",
    "Now about the sum of money we are holding.",
    "Its at your disposal at\nany time now.",
    "I dont know whether you would like us to pay it into your\nbank or whether you would like to consult us possibly as to the\ninvestment of it Its quite a large sum.",
    "Twenty thousand pounds said Miss Marple.",
    "Yes it is a very large\nsum by my way of thinking.",
    "Quite extraordinary she added.",
    "If you would like an introduction to our brokers they could give you\npossibly some ideas about investing.",
    "Oh I dont want to invest any of it.",
    "But surely it would be \n\nTheres no point in saving at my age said Miss Marple.",
    "I mean the\npoint of this money Im sure Mr Rafiel meant it that way  is to enjoy a\nfew things that one thought one never would have the money to enjoy.",
    "Well I see your point of view said Mr Broadribb.",
    "Then your\ninstructions would be that we pay this sum of money into your bank\n\nMiddletons Bank 132 High Street St Mary Mead said Miss Marple.",
    "You have a deposit account I expect.",
    "We will place it to your deposit\naccount\n\n\fCertainly not said Miss Marple.",
    "Put it into my current account.",
    "You dont think...",
    "I do think said Miss Marple.",
    "I want it in my current account.",
    "She got up and shook hands.",
    "You could ask your bank managers advice you know Miss Marple.",
    "It\nreally is one never knows when one wants something for a rainy day.",
    "The only thing I shall want for a rainy day will be my umbrella said\nMiss Marple.",
    "She shook hands with them both again.",
    "Thank you so much Mr Broadribb.",
    "And you too Mr Schuster.",
    "Youve\nbeen so kind to me giving me all the information I needed.",
    "You really want that money put into your current account\n\nYes said Miss Marple.",
    "Im going to spend it you know.",
    "Im going to\nhave some fun with it.",
    "She looked back from the door and she laughed.",
    "Just for one moment\nMr Schuster who was a man of more imagination than Mr Broadribb\nhad a vague impression of a young and pretty girl shaking hands with\nthe vicar at a garden party in the country.",
    "It was as he realised a\nmoment later a recollection of his own youth.",
    "But Miss Marple had for\n\n\fa minute reminded him of that particular girl young happy going to\nenjoy herself.",
    "Mr Rafiel would have liked me to have fun said Miss Marple.",
    "She went out of the door.",
    "Nemesis said Mr Broadribb.",
    "Thats what Rafiel called her.",
    "Nemesis\nNever seen anybody less like Nemesis have you\n\nMr Schuster shook his head.",
    "It must have been another of Mr Rafiels little jokes said Mr\nBroadribb."
