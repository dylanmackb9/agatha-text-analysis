    "THE MIRROR CRACKED FROM SIDE TO SIDE\n\nAgatha Christie\n\n\fOut flew the web and floated wide\nThe mirror crackd from side to side\nThe curse is come upon me cried\nThe Lady of Shalott\nAlfred Tennyson\n\nChapter 1\n\nMiss Jane Marple was sitting by her window.",
    "The window looked\nover her garden once a source of pride to her.",
    "That was no longer\nso.",
    "Nowadays she looked out of the window and winced.",
    "Active\ngardening had been forbidden her for some time now.",
    "No stooping\nno digging no planting  at most a little light pruning.",
    "Old Laycock\nwho came three times a week did his best no doubt.",
    "But his best\nsuch as it was which was not much was only the best according to\nhis lights and not according to those of his employer.",
    "Miss Marple\nknew exactly what she wanted done and when she wanted it done\nand instructed him duly.",
    "Old Laycock then displayed his particular\ngenius which was that of enthusiastic agreement and subsequent\nlack of performance.",
    "Thats right missus.",
    "Well have them mecosoapies there and the\nCanterburys along the wall and as you say it ought to be got on with\nfirst thing next week.",
    "Laycocks\n\nexcuses\n\nwere\n\nalways\n\nreasonable\n\nand\n\nstrongly\n\nresembled those of Captain Georges in Three Men in a Boat for\navoiding going to sea.",
    "In the captains case the wind was always\nwrong either blowing offshore or in shore or coming from the\nunreliable west or the evenmore treacherous east.",
    "Laycocks was\nthe weather.",
    "Too dry  too wet  waterlogged  a nip of frost in the\nair.",
    "Or else something of great importance had to come first\nusually to do with cabbages or brussels sprouts of which he liked\nto grow inordinate quantities.",
    "Laycocks own principles of\ngardening were simple and no employer however knowledgeable\ncould wean him from them.",
    "They consisted of a great many cups of tea sweet and strong as\nan encouragement to effort a good deal of sweeping up of leaves in\nthe autumn and a certain amount of bedding out of his own\nfavourite plants mainly asters and salvias  to make a nice show\nas he put it in summer.",
    "He was all in favour of syringeing roses for\ngreenfly but was slow to get around to it and a demand for deep\ntrenching for sweet peas was usually countered by the remark that\nyou ought to see his own sweet peas A proper treat last year and\nno fancy stuff done beforehand.",
    "To be fair he was attached to his employers humoured their\nfancies in horticulture so far as no actual hard work was involved\nbut vegetables he knew to be the real stuff of life a nice Savoy or a\nbit of curly kale flowers were fancy stuff such as ladies liked to go\nin for having nothing better to do with their time.",
    "He showed his\naffection by producing presents of the aforementioned asters\nsalvias lobelia edging and summer chrysanthemums.",
    "Been doing some work at them new houses over at the\nDevelopment.",
    "Want their gardens laid out nice they do.",
    "More\nplants than they needed so I brought along a few and Ive put em in\nwhere them oldfashioned roses aint looking so well.",
    "Thinking of these things Miss Marple averted her eyes from the\ngarden and picked up her knitting.",
    "One had to face the fact St Mary Mead was not the place it had\nbeen.",
    "In a sense of course nothing was what it had been.",
    "You\ncould blame the war both the wars or the younger generation or\nwomen going out to work or the atom bomb or just the\nGovernment  but what one really meant was the simple fact that\none was growing old.",
    "Miss Marple who was a very sensible lady\nknew that quite well.",
    "It was just that in a queer way she felt it more\nin St Mary Mead because it had been her home for so long.",
    "St Mary Mead the old world core of it was still there.",
    "The Blue Boar\nwas there and the church and the vicarage and the little nest of\nQueen Anne and Georgian houses of which hers was one.",
    "Miss\nHartnells house was still there and also Miss Hartnell fighting\nprogress to the last gasp.",
    "Miss Wetherby had passed on and her\nhouse was now inhabited by the bank manager and his family\nhaving been given a facelift by the painting of doors and windows a\nbright royal blue.",
    "There were new people in most of the other old\nhouses but the houses themselves were little changed in\nappearances since the people who had bought them had done so\nbecause they liked what the house agent called old world charm.",
    "They just added another bathroom and spent a good deal of money\non plumbing electric cookers and dishwashers.",
    "But though the houses looked much as before the same could\nhardly be said of the village street.",
    "When shops changed hands\nthere it was with a view to immediate and intemperate\nmodernization.",
    "The fishmonger was unrecognizable with new super\nwindows behind which the refrigerated fish gleamed.",
    "The butcher\nhad remained conservative  good meat is good meat if you have\nthe money to pay for it.",
    "If not you take the cheaper cuts and the\ntough joints and like it Barnes the grocer was still there\nunchanged for which Miss Harmell and Miss Marple and others\ndaily thanked Heaven.",
    "So obliging comfortable chairs to sit in by\nthe counter and cosy discussions as to cuts of bacon and varieties\nof cheese.",
    "At the end of the street however where Mr Toms had\nonce had his basket shop stood a glittering new supermarket anathema to the elderly ladies of St Mary Mead.",
    "Packets of things ones never even heard of exclaimed Miss\nHartnell.",
    "All these great packets of breakfast cereal instead of\ncooking a child a proper breakfast of bacon and eggs.",
    "And youre\nexpected to take a basket yourself and go round looking for things it takes a quarter of an hour sometimes to find all one wants  and\nusually made up in inconvenient sizes too much or too little.",
    "And\nthen a long queue waiting to pay as you go out.",
    "Most tiring.",
    "Of\ncourse its all very well for the people from the Development \n\nAt this point she stopped.",
    "Because as was now usual the sentence came to an end there.",
    "The Development Period as they would say in modern terms.",
    "It\nhad an entity of its own and a capital letter.",
    "II\n\nMiss Marple uttered a sharp exclamation of annoyance.",
    "Shed\ndropped a stitch again.",
    "Not only that she must have dropped it\nsome time ago.",
    "Not until now when she had to decrease for the\nneck and count the stitches had she realized the fact.",
    "She took up\na spare pin held the knitting sideways to the light and peered\nanxiously.",
    "Even her new spectacles didnt seem to do any good.",
    "And that she reflected was because obviously there came a time\nwhen oculists in spite of their luxurious waitingrooms the uptodate instruments the bright lights they flashed into your eyes and\nthe very high fees they charged couldnt do anything much more\nfor you.",
    "Miss Marple reflected with some nostalgia on how good her\neyesight had been a few well not perhaps a few years ago.",
    "From\nthe vantagepoint of her garden so admirably placed to see all that\nwas going on in St Mary Mead how little had escaped her noticing\neye And with the help of her bird glasses  an interest in birds was\nso useful  she had been able to see  She broke off there and let\nher thoughts run back over the past.",
    "Ann Protheroe in her summer\nfrock going along to the Vicarage garden.",
    "And Colonel Protheroe poor man  a very tiresome and unpleasant man to be sure  but to\nbe murdered like that  She shook her head and went on to thoughts\nof Griselda the vicars pretty young wife.",
    "Dear Griselda  such a\nfaithful friend  a Christmas card every year.",
    "That attractive baby of\nhers was a strapping young man now and with a very good job.",
    "Engineering was it He always had enjoyed taking his mechanical\ntrains to pieces.",
    "Beyond the Vicarage there had been the stile and\n\n\fthe field path with Farmer Giless cattle beyond in the meadows\nwhere now  now...",
    "The Development.",
    "And why not Miss Marple asked herself sternly.",
    "These things had\nto be.",
    "The houses were necessary and they were very well built or\nso she had been told.",
    "Planning or whatever they called it.",
    "Though\nwhy everything had to be called a Close she couldnt imagine.",
    "Aubrey Close and Longwood Close and Grandison Close and all\nthe rest of them.",
    "Not really Closes at all.",
    "Miss Marple knew what a\nClose was perfectly.",
    "Her uncle had been a Canon of Chichester\nCathedral.",
    "As a child she had gone to stay with him in the Close.",
    "It was like Cherry Baker who always called Miss Marples oldworld\novercrowded drawingroom the lounge.",
    "Miss Marple corrected her\ngently Its the drawingroom Cherry.",
    "And Cherry because she\nwas young and kind endeavoured to remember though it was\nobvious to her drawingroom was a very funny word to use  and\nlounge came slipping out.",
    "She had of late however compromised\non livingroom.",
    "Miss Marple liked Cherry very much.",
    "Her name was\nMrs Baker and she came from the Development.",
    "She was one of the\ndetachment of young wives who shopped at the supermarket and\nwheeled prams about the quiet streets of St Mary Mead.",
    "They were\nall smart and well turned out.",
    "Their hair was crisp and curled.",
    "They\nlaughed and talked and called to one another.",
    "They were like a\nhappy flock of birds.",
    "Owing to the insidious snares of Hire\nPurchase they were always in need of ready money though their\nhusbands all earned good wages and so they came and did\nhousework or cooking.",
    "Cherry was a quick and efficient cook she\n\n\fwas an intelligent girl took telephone calls correctly and was quick\nto spot inaccurades in the tradesmens books.",
    "She was not much\ngiven to turning mattresses and as far as washing up went Miss\nMarple always now passed the pantry door with her head turned\naway so as not to observe Cherrys method which was that of\nthrusting everything into the sink together and letting loose a\nsnowstorm of detergent on it.",
    "Miss Marple had quietly removed her\nold Worcester teaset from daily circulation and put it in the corner\ncabinet whence it only emerged on special occasions.",
    "Instead she\nhad purchased a modern service with a pattern of pale grey on\nwhite and no gilt on it whatsoever to be washed away in the sink.",
    "How different it had been in the past...",
    "Faithful Florence for\ninstance that grenadier of a parlourmaid  and there had been Amy\nand Clara and Alice those nice little maids arriving from St Faiths\nOrphanage to be trained and then going on to better paid jobs\nelsewhere.",
    "Rather simple some of them had been and frequently\nadenoidal and Amy distinctly moronic.",
    "They had gossiped and\nchattered with the other maids in the village and walked out with\nthe fishmongers assistant or the undergardener at the Hall or\none of Mr Barnes the grocers numerous assistants.",
    "Miss Marples\nmind went back over them affectionately thinking of all the little\nwoolly coats she had knitted for their subsequent offspring.",
    "They\nhad not been very good with the telephone and no good at all at\narithmetic.",
    "On the other hand they knew how to wash up and how\nto make a bed.",
    "They had had skills rather than education.",
    "It was\nodd that nowadays it should be the educated girls who went in for\nall the domestic chores.",
    "Students from abroad girls au pair\nuniversity students in the vacation young married women like\n\n\fCherry Baker who lived in spurious Closes on new building\ndevelopments.",
    "There were still of course people like Miss Knight.",
    "This last\nthought came suddenly as Miss Knights tread overhead made the\nlustres on the mantelpiece tinkle warningly.",
    "Miss Knight had\nobviously had her afternoon rest and would now go out for her\nafternoon walk.",
    "In a moment she would come to ask Miss Marple if\nshe could get her anything in the town.",
    "The thought of Miss Knight\nbrought the usual reaction to Miss Marples mind.",
    "Of course it was\nvery generous of dear Raymond her nephew and nobody could be\nkinder than Miss Knight and of course that attack of bronchitis had\nleft her very weak and Dr Haydock had said very firmly that she\nmust not go on sleeping alone in the house with only someone\ncoming in daily but  She stopped there.",
    "Because it was no use\ngoing on with the thought which was If only it could have been\nsomeone other than Miss Knight.",
    "But there wasnt much choice for\nelderly ladies nowadays.",
    "Devoted maidservants had gone out of\nfashion.",
    "In real illness you could have a proper hospital nurse at\nvast expense and procured with difficulty or you could go to\nhospital.",
    "But after the critical phase of illness had passed you were\ndown to the Miss Knights.",
    "There wasnt Miss Marple reflected anything wrong about the Miss\nKnights other than the fact that they were madly irritating.",
    "They\nwere full of kindness ready to feel affection towards their charges\nto humour them to be bright and cheerful with them and in general\nto treat them as slightly mentally afflicted children.",
    "But I said Miss Marple to herself although I may be old am not a\nmentally retarded child.",
    "At this moment breathing rather heavily as was her custom Miss\nKnight bounced brightly into the room.",
    "She was a big rather flabby\nwoman of fiftysix with yellowing grey hair very elaborately\narranged glasses a long thin nose and below it a goodnatured\nmouth and a weak chin.",
    "Here\n\nwe\n\nare\n\nshe\n\nexclaimed\n\nwith\n\na\n\nkind\n\nof\n\nbeaming\n\nboisterousness meant to cheer and enliven the sad twilight of the\naged.",
    "I hope weve had our little snooze\n\nI have been knitting Miss Marple replied putting some emphasis\non the pronoun and she went on confessing her weakness with\ndistaste and shame Ive dropped a stitch.",
    "Oh dear dear said Miss Knight.",
    "Well well soon put that right\nwont we\n\nYou will said Miss Marple.",
    "I alas am unable to do so.",
    "The slight acerbity of her tone passed quite unnoticed.",
    "Miss Knight\nas always was eager to help.",
    "There she said after a few moments.",
    "There you are dear.",
    "Quite\nall right now.",
    "Though Miss Marple was perfectly agreeable to be called dear\nand even ducks by the woman at the greengrocer or the girl at\n\n\fthe paper shop it annoyed her intensely to be called dear by Miss\nKnight.",
    "Another of those things that elderly ladies have to bear.",
    "She\nthanked Miss Knight politely.",
    "And now Im just going out for my wee toddle said Miss Knight\nhumorously.",
    "Shant be long.",
    "Please dont dream of hurrying back said Miss Marple politely and\nsincerely.",
    "Well I dont like to leave you too long on your own dear in case\nyou get moped.",
    "I assure you I am quite happy said Miss Marple.",
    "I probably shall\nhave she closed her eyes a little nap.",
    "Thats right dear.",
    "Anything I can get you\n\nMiss Marple opened her eyes and considered.",
    "You might go into Longdons and see if the curtains are ready.",
    "And\nperhaps another skein of the blue wool from Mrs Wisley.",
    "And a box\nof blackcurrant lozenges at the chemists.",
    "And change my book at\nthe library  but dont let them give you anything that isnt on my list.",
    "This last one was too terrible.",
    "I couldnt read it.",
    "She held out The\nSpring Awakens.",
    "Oh dear dear Didnt you like it I thought youd love it.",
    "Such a\npretty story.",
    "And if it isnt too far for you perhaps you wouldnt mind going as\nfar as Halletts and see if they have one of those upanddown egg\nwhisks  not the turnthehandle kind.",
    "She knew very well they had nothing of the kind but Halletts was\nthe farthest shop possible.",
    "If all this isnt too much  she murmured.",
    "But Miss Knight replied with obvious sincerity.",
    "Not at all.",
    "I shall be delighted.",
    "Miss Knight loved shopping.",
    "It was the breath of life to her.",
    "One met\nacquaintances and had the chance of a chat one gossiped with\nthe assistants and had the opportunity of examining various\narticles in the various shops.",
    "And one could spend quite a long time\nengaged in these pleasant occupations without any guilty feeling\nthat it was ones duty to hurry back.",
    "So Miss Knight started off happily after a last glance at the frail old\nlady resting so peacefully by the window.",
    "After waiting a few minutes in case Miss Knight should return for a\nshopping bag or her purse or a handkerchief she was a great\nforgetter and returner and also to recover from the slight mental\nfatigue induced by thinking of so many unwanted things to ask Miss\nKnight to get Miss Marple rose briskly to her feet cast aside her\nknitting and strode purposefully across the room and into the hall.",
    "She took down her summer coat from its peg a stick from the hall\n\n\fstand and exchanged her bedroom slippers for a pair of stout\nwalking shoes.",
    "Then she left the house by the side door.",
    "It will take her at least an hour and a half Miss Marple estimated to\nherself.",
    "Quite that  with all the people from the Development doing\ntheir shopping.",
    "Miss Marple visualized Miss Knight at Longdons making abortive\ninquiries re curtains.",
    "Her surmises were remarkably accurate.",
    "At\nthis moment Miss Knight was exclaiming Of course I felt quite\nsure in my own mind they wouldnt be ready yet.",
    "But of course I said\nId come along and see when the old lady spoke about it.",
    "Poor old\ndears theyve got so little to look forward to.",
    "One must humour\nthem.",
    "And shes a sweet old lady.",
    "Failing a little now its only to be\nexpected  their faculties get dimmed.",
    "Now thats a pretty material\nyouve got there.",
    "Do you have it in any other colours\n\nA pleasant twenty minutes passed.",
    "When Miss Knight had finally\ndeparted the senior assistant remarked with a sniff Failing is\nshe Ill believe that when I see it for myself.",
    "Old Miss Marple has\nalways been as sharp as a needle and Id say she still is.",
    "She then\ngave her attention to a young woman in tight trousers and a sailcloth jersey who wanted plastic material with crabs on it for\nbathroom curtains.",
    "Emily Waters thats who she reminds me of Miss Marple was\nsaying to herself with the satisfaction it always gave her to match\nup a human personality with one known in the past.",
    "Just the same\nbird brain.",
    "Let me see what happened to Emily\n\n\fNothing much was her conclusion.",
    "She had once nearly got\nengaged to a curate but after an understanding of several years\nthe affair had fizzled out.",
    "Miss Marple dismissed her nurse\nattendant\n\nfrom\n\nher\n\nmind\n\nand\n\ngave\n\nher\n\nattention\n\nto\n\nher\n\nsurroundings.",
    "She had traversed the garden rapidly only observing\nas it were from the corner of her eye that Laycock had cut down the\noldfashioned roses in a way more suitable to hybrid teas but she\ndid not allow this to distress her or distract her from the delirious\npleasure of having escaped for an outing entirely on her own.",
    "She\nhad a happy feeling of adventure.",
    "She turned to the right entered\nthe Vicarage gate took the path through the Vicarage garden and\ncame out on the right of way.",
    "Where the stile had been there was\nnow an iron swing gate giving on to a tarred asphalt path.",
    "This led\nto a neat little bridge over the stream and on the other side of the\nstream where once there had been meadows with cows there was\nthe Development.",
    "Chapter 2\n\nWith the feeling of Columbus setting out to discover a new world\nMiss Marple passed over the bridge continued on to the path and\nwithin four minutes was actually in Aubrey Close.",
    "Of course Miss Marple had seen the Development from the Market\nBasing Road that is had seen from afar its Closes and rows of neat\nwellbuilt houses with their television masts and their blue and pink\nand yellow and green painted doors and windows.",
    "But until now it\nhad only had the reality of a map as it were.",
    "She had not been in it\n\n\fand of it.",
    "But now she was here observing the brave new word that\nwas springing up the world that by all accounts was foreign to all\nshe had known.",
    "It was like a neat model built with childs bricks.",
    "It\nhardly seemed real to Miss Marple.",
    "The people too looked unreal.",
    "The trousered young women the\nrather sinisterlooking young men and boys the exuberant bosoms\nof the fifteenyearold girls.",
    "Miss Marple couldnt help thinking that\nit all looked terribly depraved.",
    "Nobody noticed her much as she\ntrudged along.",
    "She turned out of Aubrey Close and was presently in\nDarlington Close.",
    "She went slowly and as she went she listened\navidly to the snippets of conversation between mothers wheeling\nprams to the girls addressing young men to the sinisterlooking\nTeds she supposed they were Teds exchanging dark remarks with\neach other.",
    "Mothers came out on doorsteps calling to their children\nwho as usual were busy doing all the things they had been told not\nto do.",
    "Children Miss Marple reflected gratefully never changed.",
    "And presently she began to smile and noted down in her mind her\nusual series of recognitions.",
    "That woman is just like Carry Edwards  and the dark one is just like\nthat Hooper girl  shell make a mess of her marriage just like Mary\nHooper did.",
    "Those boys  the dark one is just like Edward Leeke a\nlot of wild talk but no harm in him  a nice boy really  the fair one is\nMrs Bedwells Josh all over again.",
    "Nice boys both of them.",
    "The one\nlike Gregory Binns wont do very well Im afraid.",
    "I expect hes got\nthe same sort of mother...\n\nShe turned a corner into Walsingham Close and her spirits rose\nevery moment.",
    "The new world was the same as the old.",
    "The houses were different\nthe streets were called Closes the clothes were different the\nvoices were different but the human beings were the same as they\nalways had been.",
    "And though using slightly different phraseology\nthe subjects of conversation were the same.",
    "By dint of turning corners in her exploration Miss Marple had\nrather lost her sense of direction and had arrived at the edge of the\nhousing estate again.",
    "She was now in Carrisbrook Close half of\nwhich was still under construction.",
    "At the firstfloor window of a\nnearly finished house a young couple were standing.",
    "Their voices\nfloated down as they discussed the amenities.",
    "You must admit its a nice position Harry.",
    "Other one was just as good.",
    "This ones got two more rooms.",
    "And youve got to pay for them.",
    "Well I like this one.",
    "You would\n\nOw dont be such a spoilsport.",
    "You know what Mum said.",
    "Your Mum never stops saying.",
    "Dont you say nothing against Mum.",
    "Whered I have been without\nher And she might have cut up nastier than she did.",
    "She could\nhave taken you to court.",
    "Oh come off it Lily.",
    "Its a good view of the hills.",
    "You can almost see  She leaned far\nout twisting her body to the left.",
    "You can almost see the reservoir \n\nShe leant farther still not realizing that she was resting her weight\non loose boards that had been laid across the sill.",
    "They slipped\nunder the pressure of her body sliding outwards carrying her with\nthem.",
    "She screamed trying to regain her balance.",
    "Harry\n\nThe young man stood motionless  a foot or two behind her.",
    "He took\none step backwards \n\nDesperately clawing at the wall the girl righted herself.",
    "Oo She let out a frightened breath.",
    "I near as nothing fell out.",
    "Why\ndidnt you get hold of me\n\nIt was all so quick.",
    "Anyway youre all right.",
    "Thats all you know about it.",
    "I nearly went I tell you.",
    "And look at the\nfront of my jumper its all mussed.",
    "Miss Marple went on a little way then on impulse she turned back.",
    "Lily was outside in the road waiting for the young man to lock up the\nhouse.",
    "Miss Marple went up to her and spoke rapidly in a low voice.",
    "If I were you my dear I shouldnt marry that young man.",
    "You want\nsomeone whom you can rely upon if youre in danger.",
    "You must\nexcuse me for saying this to you  but I feel you ought to be warned.",
    "She turned away and Lily stared after her.",
    "Well of all the \n\nHer young man approached.",
    "What was she saying to you Lil\n\nLily opened her mouth  then shut it again.",
    "Giving me the gipsys warning if you want to know.",
    "She eyed him in a thoughtful manner.",
    "Miss Marple in her anxiety to get away quickly turned a corner\nstumbled over some loose stones and fell.",
    "A woman came running out of one of the houses.",
    "Oh dear what a nasty spill I hope you havent hurt yourself\n\nWith almost excessive goodwill she put her arms round Miss Marple\nand tugged her to her feet.",
    "No bones broken I hope There we are.",
    "I expect you feel rather\nshaken.",
    "Her voice was loud and friendly.",
    "She was a plump squarely built\nwoman of about forty brown hair just turning grey blue eyes and a\nbig generous mouth that seemed to Miss Marples rather shaken\ngaze to be far too full of white shining teeth.",
    "Youd better come inside and sit down and rest a bit.",
    "Ill make you a\ncup of tea.",
    "Miss Marple thanked her.",
    "She allowed herself to be led through the\nbluepainted door and into a small room full of bright cretonnecovered chairs and sofas.",
    "There you are said her rescuer establishing her on a cushioned\narmchair.",
    "You sit quiet and Ill put the kettle on.",
    "She hurried out of the room which seemed rather restfully quiet\nafter her departure.",
    "Miss Marple took a deep breath.",
    "She was not\nreally hurt but the fall had shaken her.",
    "Falls at her age were not to\nbe encouraged.",
    "With luck however she thought guiltily Miss\nKnight need never know.",
    "She moved her arms and legs gingerly.",
    "Nothing broken.",
    "If she could only get home all right.",
    "Perhaps after\na cup of tea \n\n\fThe cup of tea arrived almost as the thought came to her.",
    "Brought\non a tray with four sweet biscuits on a little plate.",
    "There you are.",
    "It was placed on a small table in front of her.",
    "Shall I\npour it out for you Better have plenty of sugar.",
    "No sugar thank you.",
    "You must have sugar.",
    "Shock you know.",
    "I was abroad with\nambulances during the war.",
    "Sugars wonderful for shock.",
    "She put\nfour lumps in the cup and stirred vigorously.",
    "Now you get that\ndown and youll feel as right as rain.",
    "Miss Marple accepted the dictum.",
    "A kind woman she thought.",
    "She reminds me of someone  now\nwho is it\n\nYouve been very kind to me she said smiling.",

    "Not actually do murders  find out about\nthem.",
    "Thats right isnt it\n\nMiss Marple murmured modestly that she had been mixed in\nmurders once or twice.",
    "I heard there have been murders here in this village.",
    "They were\ntalking about it the other night at the Bingo Club.",
    "There was one at\n\n\fGossington Hall.",
    "I wouldnt buy a place where thered been a\nmurder.",
    "Id be sure it was haunted.",
    "The murder wasnt committed in Gossington Hall.",
    "A dead body was\nbrought there.",
    "Found in the library on the hearthrug thats what they said\n\nMiss Marple nodded.",
    "Did you ever Perhaps theyre going to make a film of it.",
    "Perhaps\nthats why Marina Gregg has bought Gossington Hall.",
    "Marina Gregg\n\nYes.",
    "She and her husband.",
    "I forget his name  hes a producer I\nthink or a director  Jason something.",
    "But Marina Gregg shes\nlovely isnt she Of course she hasnt been in so many pictures of\nlate years  she was ill for a long time.",
    "But I still think theres never\nanybody like her.",
    "Did you see her in Carmenella.",
    "And The Price of\nLove and Mary of Scotland Shes not so young any more but shell\nalways be a wonderful actress.",
    "Ive always been a terrific fan of\nhers.",
    "When I was a teenager I used to dream about her.",
    "The big\nthrill of my life was when there was a big show in aid of the St John\nAmbulance in Bermuda and Marina Gregg came to open it.",
    "I was\nmad with excitement and then on the very day I went down with a\ntemperature and the doctor said I couldnt go.",
    "But I wasnt going to\nbe beaten.",
    "I didnt actually feel too bad.",
    "So I got up and put a lot of\nmakeup on my face and went along.",
    "I was introduced to her and\n\n\fshe talked to me for quite three minutes and gave me her\nautograph.",
    "It was wonderful.",
    "Ive never forgotten that day.",
    "Miss Marple stared at her.",
    "I hope there were no  unfortunate aftereffects she said\nanxiously.",
    "Heather Badcock laughed.",
    "None at all.",
    "Never felt better.",
    "What I say is if you want a thing\nyouve got to take risks.",
    "I always do.",
    "She laughed again a happy strident laugh.",
    "Arthur Badcock said admiringly.",
    "Theres never any holding\nHeather.",
    "She always gets away with things.",
    "Alison Wilde murmured Miss Marple with a nod of satisfaction.",
    "Pardon said Mr Badcock.",
    "Nothing.",
    "Just someone I used to know.",
    "Heather looked at her inquiringly.",
    "You reminded me of her that is all.",
    "Did I I hope she was nice.",
    "She was very nice indeed said Miss Marple slowly.",
    "Kind healthy\nfull of life.",
    "But she had her faults I suppose laughed Heather.",
    "I have.",
    "Well Alison always saw her own point of view so clearly that she\ndidnt always see how things might appear to or affect other\npeople.",
    "Like the time you took in that evacuated family from a condemned\ncottage and they went off with all our teaspoons Arthur said.",
    "But Arthur  I couldnt have turned them away.",
    "It wouldnt have\nbeen kind.",
    "They were family spoons said Mr Badcock sadly.",
    "Georgian.",
    "Belonged to my mothers grandmother.",
    "Oh do forget those old spoons Arthur.",

    "Alison Wilde Oh  she died.",
    "Chapter 3\n\nIm glad to be back said Mrs Bantry.",
    "Although of course Ive had\na wonderful time.",
    "Miss Marple nodded appreciatively and accepted a cup of tea from\nher friends hand.",
    "When her husband Colonel Bantry had died some years ago Mrs\nBantry had sold Gossington Hall and the considerable amount of\nland attached to it retaining for herself what had been the East\nLodge\n\na\n\ncharming\n\nporticoed\n\nlittle\n\nbuilding\n\nreplete\n\nwith\n\ninconvenience where even a gardener had refused to live.",
    "Mrs\nBantry had added to it the essentials of modern life a builton\nkitchen of the latest type a new water supply from the main\nelectricity and a bathroom.",
    "This had all cost her a great deal but\nnot nearly so much as an attempt to live at Gossington Hall would\nhave done.",
    "She had also retained the essentials of privacy about\nthree quarters of an acre of garden nicely ringed with trees so\nthat as she explained.",
    "Whatever they do with Gossington I shant\nreally see it or worry.",
    "For the last few years she had spent a good deal of the year\ntravelling about visiting children and grandchildren in various\nparts of the globe and coming back from time to time to enjoy the\nprivacies of her own home.",
    "Gossington Hall itself had changed\nhands once or twice.",
    "It had been run as a guest house failed and\n\n\fbeen bought by four people who had shared it as four roughly\ndivided flats and subsequently quarrelled.",
    "Finally the Ministry of\nHealth had bought it for some obscure purpose for which they\neventually did not want it.",
    "The Ministry had now resold it  and it\nwas this sale which the two friends were discussing.",
    "I have heard rumours of course said Miss Marple.",
    "Naturally said Mrs Bantry.",
    "It was even said that Charlie Chaplin\nand all his children were coming to live here.",
    "That would have been\nwonderful fun unfortunately there isnt a word of truth in it.",
    "No its\ndefinitely Marina Gregg.",
    "How very lovely she was said Miss Marple with a sigh.",
    "I always\nremember those early films of hers.",
    "Bird of Passage with that\nhandsome Joel Roberts.",
    "And the Mary Queen of Scots film.",
    "And of\ncourse it was very sentimental but I did enjoy Comin thru the Rye.",
    "Oh dear that was a long time ago.",
    "Yes said Mrs Bantry.",
    "She must be  what do you think Fortyfive\nFifty\n\nMiss Marple thought nearer fifty.",
    "Has she been in anything lately Of course I dont go very often to\nthe cinema nowadays.",
    "Only small parts I think said Mrs Bantry.",
    "She hasnt been a star\nfor quite a long time.",
    "She had that bad nervous breakdown.",
    "After\none of her divorces.",
    "Such a lot of husbands they all have said Miss Marple.",
    "It must\nreally be quite tiring.",
    "It wouldnt suit me said Mrs Bantry.",
    "After youve fallen in love with\na man and married him and got used to his ways and settled down\ncomfortably  to go and throw it all up and start again It seems to\nme madness.",
    "I cant presume to speak said Miss Marple with a little spinsterish\ncough never having married.",
    "But it seems you know a pity.",
    "I suppose they cant help it really said Mrs Bantry vaguely.",
    "With\nthe kind of lives they have to live.",
    "So public you know.",
    "I met her\nshe added.",
    "Marina Gregg I mean when I was in California.",
    "What was she like Miss Marple asked with interest.",
    "Charming said Mrs Bantry.",
    "So natural and unspoiled.",
    "She added\nthoughtfully Its like a kind of livery really.",
    "What is\n\nBeing unspoiled and natural.",
    "You learn how to do it and then you\nhave to go on being it all the time.",
    "Just think of the hell of it  never\nto be able to chuck something and say Oh for the Lords sake\nstop bothering me.",
    "I dare say that in sheer selfdefence you have\nto have drunken parties or orgies.",
    "Shes had five husbands hasnt she Miss Marple asked.",
    "At least.",
    "An early one that didnt count and then a foreign Prince or\nCount and then another film star Robert Truscott wasnt it That\nwas built up as a great romance.",
    "But it only lasted four years.",
    "And\nthen Isidore Wright the playwright.",
    "That was rather serious and\nquiet and she had a baby apparently shed always longed to have a\nchild  shes even halfadopted a few strays  anyway this was the\nreal thing.",
    "Very much built up.",
    "Motherhood with a capital M. And\nthen I believe it was an imbecile or queer or something  and it\nwas after that that she had this breakdown and started to take\ndrugs and all that and threw up her parts.",
    "You seem to know a lot about her said Miss Marple.",
    "Well naturally said Mrs Bantry.",
    "When she bought Gossington I\nwas interested.",
    "She married the present man about two years ago\nand they say shes quite all right again now.",
    "Hes a producer  or do\nI mean a director I always get mixed.",
    "He was in love with her when\nthey were quite young but he didnt mount to very much in those\ndays.",
    "But now I believe hes got quite famous.",
    "Whats his name\nnow Jason  Jason something  Jason Hudd no Rudd thats it.",
    "Theyve bought Gossington because its handy for  she hesitated Elstree she hazarded.",
    "Miss Marple shook her head.",
    "I dont think so she said.",
    "Elstrees in North London.",
    "Its the fairly new studios.",
    "Hellingforth  thats it.",
    "Sounds so Finnish\nI always think.",
    "About six miles from Market Basing.",
    "Shes going to\ndo a film on Elizabeth of Austria I believe.",
    "What a lot you know said Miss Marple.",
    "About the private lives of\nfilm stars.",
    "Did you learn it all in California\n\nNot really said Mrs Bantry.",
    "Actually I get it from the extraordinary\nmagazines I read at my hairdressers.",
    "Most of the stars I dont even\nknow by name but as I said because Marina Gregg and her\nhusband have bought Gossington I was interested.",
    "Really the\nthings those magazines say I dont suppose half of it is true probably not a quarter.",
    "I dont believe Marina Gregg is a\nnymphomaniac I dont think she drinks probably she doesnt even\ntake drugs and quite likely she just went away to have a nice rest\nand didnt have a nervous breakdown at all  but its true that she is\ncoming here to live.",
    "Next week I heard said Miss Marple.",
    "As soon as that I know shes lending Gossington for a big f\u043ate on\nthe twentythird in aid of the St John Ambulance Corps.",
    "I suppose\ntheyve done a lot to the house\n\nPractically everything said Miss Marple.",
    "Really it would have\nbeen much simpler and probably cheaper to have pulled it down\nand built a new house.",
    "Bathrooms I suppose\n\n\fSix new ones I hear.",
    "And a palm court.",
    "And a pool.",
    "And what I\nbelieve they call picture windows and theyve knocked your\nhusbands study and the library into one to make a music room.",
    "Arthur will turn in his grave.",
    "You know how he hated music.",
    "Tone\ndeaf poor dear.",
    "His face when some kind friend took us to the\nopera Hell probably come back and haunt them.",
    "She stopped and\nthen said abruptly.",
    "Does anyone ever hint that Gossington might be\nhaunted\n\nMiss Marple shook her head.",
    "It isnt she said with certainty.",
    "That wouldnt prevent people saying it was Mrs Bantry pointed\nout.",
    "Nobody ever has said so.",
    "Miss Marple paused and the said.",
    "People arent really foolish you know.",
    "Not in villages.",
    "Mrs Bantry shot her a quick look.",
    "Youve always stuck to that Jane.",
    "And I wont say that youre not right.",
    "She suddenly smiled.",
    "Marina Gregg asked me very sweetly and delicately if I wouldnt\nfind it very painful to see my old home occupied by strangers.",
    "I\nassured her that it wouldnt hurt me at all.",
    "I dont think she quite\nbelieved me.",
    "But after all as you know Jane Gossington wasnt\nour home.",
    "We werent brought up there as children  thats what\n\n\freally counts.",
    "It was just a house with a nice bit of shooting and\nfishing attached that we bought when Arthur retired.",
    "We thought of\nit I remember as a house that would be nice and easy to run How\nwe can ever have thought that I cant imagine All those staircases\nand passages.",
    "Only four servants Only Those were the days ha\nha She added suddenly Whats all this about your falling down\nThat Knight woman ought not to let you go out by yourself.",
    "It wasnt poor Miss Knights fault.",
    "I gave her a lot of shopping to do\nand then I \n\nDeliberately gave her the slip I see.",
    "Well you shouldnt do it Jane.",
    "Not at your age.",
    "How did you hear about it\n\nMrs Bantry grinned.",
    "You cant keep any secrets in St Mary Mead.",
    "Youve often told me\nso.",
    "Mrs Meavy told me.",
    "Mrs Meavy Miss Marple looked at sea.",
    "She comes in daily.",
    "Shes from the Development.",
    "Oh the Development.",
    "The usual pause happened.",
    "What were you doing in the Development asked Mrs Bantry\ncuriously.",
    "I just wanted to see it.",
    "To see what the people were like.",
    "And what did you think they were like\n\nJust the same as everyone else.",
    "I dont quite know if that was\ndisappointing or reassuring.",
    "Disappointing I should think.",
    "No.",
    "I think its reassuring.",
    "It makes you  well  recognize certain\ntypes  so that when anything occurs  one will understand quite\nwell why and for what reason.",
    "Murder do you mean\n\nMiss Marple looked shocked.",
    "I dont know why you should assume that I think of murder all the\ntime.",
    "Nonsense Jane.",
    "Why dont you come out boldly and call yourself a\ncriminologist and have done with it\n\nBecause I am nothing of the sort said Miss Marple with spirit.",
    "It is\nsimply that I have a certain knowledge of human nature  that is only\nnatural after having lived in a small village all my life.",
    "You probably have something there said Mrs Bantry thoughtfully\nthough most people wouldnt agree of course.",
    "Your nephew\nRaymond always used to say this place was a complete backwater.",
    "Dear Raymond said Miss Marple indulgently.",
    "She added Hes\nalways been so kind.",
    "Hes paying for Miss Knight you know.",
    "The thought of Miss Knight induced a new train of thought and she\narose and said Id better be going back now I suppose.",
    "You didnt walk all the way here did you\n\nOf course not.",
    "I came in Inch.",
    "This somewhat enigmatic pronouncement was received with\ncomplete understanding.",
    "In days very long past Mr Inch had been\nthe proprietor of two cabs which met trains at the local station and\nwhich were also hired by the local ladies to take them calling out\nto tea parties and occasionally with their daughters to such\nfrivolous entertainments as dances.",
    "In the fulness of time Inch a\ncheery redfaced man of seventyodd gave place to his son known as young Inch he was then aged fortyfive though old Inch\nstill continued to drive such elderly ladies as considered his son too\nyoung and irresponsible.",
    "To keep up with the times young Inch\nabandoned horse vehicles for motor cars.",
    "He was not very good\nwith machinery and in due course a certain Mr Bardwell took over\nfrom him.",
    "The name Inch persisted.",
    "Mr Bardwell in due course sold\nout to Mr Roberts but in the telephone book Inchs Taxi Service\nwas still the official name and the older ladies of the community\ncontinued to refer to their journeys as going somewhere in Inch\nas though they were Jonah and Inch was a whale.",
    "II\n\nDr Haydock called said Miss Knight reproachfully.",
    "I told him youd\ngone to tea with Mrs Bantry.",
    "He said hed call in again tomorrow.",
    "She helped Miss Marple off with her wraps.",
    "And now I expect were tired out she said accusingly.",
    "You may be said Miss Marple.",
    "I am not.",
    "You come and sit cosy by the fire said Miss Knight as usual\npaying no attention.",
    "You dont need to take much notice of what\nthe old dears say.",
    "I just humour them.",
    "And how would we fancy a\nnice cup of Ovaltine Or Horlicks for a change\n\nMiss Marple thanked her and said she would like a small glass of\ndry sherry.",
    "Miss Knight looked disapproving.",
    "I dont know what the doctor would say to that Im sure she said\nwhen she returned with the glass.",
    "We will make a point of asking him tomorrow morning said Miss\nMarple.",
    "On the following morning Miss Knight met Dr Haydock in the hall\nand did some agitated whispering.",
    "The elderly doctor came into the room rubbing his hands for it was\na chilly morning.",
    "Heres our doctor to see us said Miss Knight gaily.",
    "Can I take your\ngloves Doctor\n\nTheyll be all right here said Haydock casting them carelessly on\na table.",
    "Quite a nippy morning.",
    "A little glass of sherry perhaps suggested Miss Marple.",
    "I heard you were taking to drink.",
    "Well you should never drink\nalone.",
    "The decanter and the glasses were already on a small table by Miss\nMarple.",
    "Miss Knight left the room.",
    "Dr Haydock was a very old friend.",
    "He had semiretired but came to\nattend certain of his old patients.",
    "I hear youve been falling about he said as he finished his glass.",
    "It\nwont do you know not at your age.",
    "Im warning you.",
    "And I hear\nyou didnt want to send for Sandford.",
    "Sandford was Haydocks partner.",
    "That Miss Knight of yours sent for him anyway  and she was quite\nright.",
    "I was only bruised and shaken a little.",
    "Dr Sandford said so.",
    "I could\nhave waited quite well until you were back.",
    "Now look here my dear.",
    "I cant go on for ever.",
    "And Sandford let\nme tell you has better qualifications them I have.",
    "Hes a first class\nman.",
    "The younger doctors are all the same said Miss Marple.",
    "They take\nyour blood pressure and whatevers the matter with you you get\nsome kind of mass produced variety of new pills.",
    "Pink ones yellow\nones brown ones.",
    "Medicine nowadays is just like a supermarket all packaged up.",
    "Serve you right if I prescribed leeches and black draught and\nrubbed your chest with camphorated oil.",
    "I do that myself when Ive got a cough said Miss Marple with spirit\nand very comforting it is.",
    "We dont like getting old thats what it is said Haydock gently.",
    "I\nhate it.",
    "Youre quite a young man compared to me said Miss Marple.",
    "And\nI dont really mind getting old  not that in itself.",
    "Its the lesser\nindignities.",
    "I think I know what you mean.",
    "Never being alone The difficulty of getting out for a few minutes by\noneself.",
    "And even my knitting  such a comfort that has always\n\n\fbeen and I really am a good knitter.",
    "Now I drop stitches all the time\n and quite often I dont even know I dropped them.",
    "Haydock looked at her thoughtfully.",
    "Then his eyes twinkled.",
    "Theres always the opposite.",
    "Now what do you mean by that\n\nIf you cant knit what about unravelling for a change Penelope\ndid.",
    "Im hardly in her position.",
    "But unravellings rather in your line isnt it\n\nHe rose to his feet.",
    "I must be getting along.",
    "What Id prescribe for you is a nice juicy\nmurder.",
    "Thats an outrageous thing to say\n\nIsnt it However you can always make do with the depth the\nparsley sank into the butter on a summers day.",
    "I always wondered\nabout that.",
    "Good old Holmes.",
    "A period piece nowadays I suppose.",
    "But hell never be forgotten.",
    "Miss Knight bustled in after the doctor had gone.",
    "There he said we look much more cheerful.",
    "Did the doctor\nrecommend a tonic\n\nHe recommended me to take an interest in murder.",
    "A nice detective story\n\nNo said Miss Marple.",
    "Real life.",
    "Goodness exclaimed Miss Knight.",
    "But theres not likely to be a\nmurder in this quiet spot.",
    "Murders said Miss Marple can happen anywhere.",
    "And do.",
    "At the Development perhaps mused Miss Knight.",
    "A lot of those\nTeddylooking boys carry knives.",
    "But the murder when it came was not at the Development.",
    "Chapter 4\n\nMrs Bantry stepped back a foot or two surveyed herself in the\nglass made a slight adjustment to her hat she was not used to\nwearing hats drew on a pair of good quality leather gloves and left\nthe lodge closing the door carefully behind her.",
    "She had the most\npleasurable anticipations of what lay in front of her.",
    "Some three\n\n\fweeks had passed since her talk with Miss Marple.",
    "Marina Gregg\nand her husband had arrived at Gossington Hall and were now\nmore or less installed there.",
    "There was to be a meeting there this afternoon of the main persons\ninvolved in the arrangements for the f\u043ate in aid of the St John\nAmbulance.",
    "Mrs Bantry was not among those on the committee but\nshe had received a note from Marina Gregg asking her to come and\nhave tea beforehand.",
    "It had recalled their meeting in California and\nhad\n\nbeen\n\nsigned\n\nCordially\n\nMarina\n\nGregg.",
    "It\n\nhad\n\nbeen\n\nhandwritten not typewritten.",
    "There is no denying that Mrs Bantry\nwas both pleased and flattered.",
    "After all a celebrated film star is a\ncelebrated film star and elderly ladies though they may be of local\nimportance are aware of their complete unimportance in the world\nof celebrities.",
    "So Mrs Bantry had the pleased feeling of a child for\nwhom a special treat had been arranged.",
    "As she walked up the drive Mrs Bantrys keen eyes went from side\nto side registering her impressions.",
    "The place had been smartened\nup since the days when it had passed from hand to hand.",
    "No\nexpense\n\nspared\n\nsaid\n\nMrs\n\nBantry\n\nto\n\nherself\n\nnodding\n\nin\n\nsatisfaction.",
    "The drive afforded no view of the flower garden and\nfor that Mrs Bantry was just as pleased.",
    "The flower garden and its\nspecial herbaceous border had been her own particular delight in\nthe faroff days when she had lived at Gossington Hall.",
    "She\npermitted regretful and nostalgic memories of her irises.",
    "The best\niris garden of any in the country she told herself with a fierce pride.",
    "Faced by a new front door in a blaze of new paint she pressed the\nbell.",
    "The door was opened with gratifying promptness by what was\n\n\fundeniably an Italian butler.",
    "She was ushered by him straight to the\nroom which had been Colonel Bantrys library.",
    "This as she had\nalready heard had been thrown into one with the study.",
    "The result\nwas impressive.",
    "The walls were panelled the floor was parquet.",
    "At\none end was a grand piano and halfway along the wall was a superb\nrecord player.",
    "At the other end of the room was a small island as it\nwere which comprised Persian rugs a teatable and some chairs.",
    "By the teatable sat Marina Gregg and leaning against the\nmantelpiece was what Mrs Bantry at first thought to be the ugliest\nman she had ever seen.",
    "Just a few moments previously when Mrs Bantrys hand had been\nadvanced to press the bell Marina Gregg had been saying in a soft\nenthusiastic voice to her husband\n\nThis place is right for me Jinks just right.",
    "Its what Ive always\nwanted.",
    "Quiet.",
    "English quiet and the English countryside.",
    "I can see\nmyself living here living here all my life if need be.",
    "And well adopt\nthe English way of life.",
    "Well have afternoon tea every afternoon\nwith China tea and my lovely Georgian tea service.",
    "And well look\nout of the window on those lawns and that English herbaceous\nborder.",
    "Ive come home at last thats what I feel.",
    "I feel that I can\nsettle down here that I can be quiet and happy.",
    "Its going to be\nhome this place.",
    "Thats what I feel.",
    "Home.",
    "And Jason Rudd known to his wife as Jinks had smiled at her.",
    "It\nwas an acquiescent smile indulgent but it held its reserve\nbecause after all he had heard it very often before.",
    "Perhaps this\ntime it would be true.",
    "Perhaps this was the place that Marina Gregg\nmight feel at home.",
    "But he knew her early enthusiasms so well.",
    "She\n\n\fwas always so sure that at last she had found exactly what she\nwanted.",
    "He said in his deep voice\n\nThats grand honey.",
    "Thats just grand.",
    "Im glad you like it.",
    "Like it I adore it.",
    "Dont you adore it too\n\nSure said Jason Rudd.",
    "Sure.",
    "It wasnt too bad he reflected to himself.",
    "Good solidly built rather\nugly Victorian.",
    "It had he admitted a feeling of solidity and security.",
    "Now that the worst of its fantastic inconveniences had been ironed\nout it would be quite reasonably comfortable to live in.",
    "Not a bad\nplace to come back to from time to time.",
    "With luck he thought\nMarina wouldnt start taking a dislike to it for perhaps two years to\ntwo years and a half.",
    "It all depended.",
    "Marina said sighing softly\n\nIts so wonderful to feel well again.",
    "Well and strong.",
    "Able to cope\nwith things.",
    "And he said again Sure honey sure.",
    "And it was at that moment that the door opened and the Italian\nbutler had ushered in Mrs Bantry.",
    "Marina Greggs welcome was all that was charming.",
    "She came\nforward hands outstretched saying how delightful it was to meet\nMrs Bantry again.",
    "And what a coincidence that they should have\n\n\fmet that time in San Francisco and that two yeats later she and\nJinks should actually buy the house that had once belonged to Mrs\nBantry.",
    "And she did hope she really did hope that Mrs Bantry\nwouldnt mind terribly the way theyd pulled the house about and\ndone things to it and she hoped she wouldnt feel that they were\nterrible intruders living here.",
    "Your coming to live here is one of the most exciting things that has\never happened to this place said Mrs Bantry cheerfully and she\nlooked towards the mantelpiece.",
    "Whereupon almost as an afterthought Marina Gregg said\n\nYou dont know my husband do you Jason this is Mrs Bantry.",
    "Mrs Bantry looked at Jason Rudd with some interest.",
    "Her first\nimpression that this was one of the ugliest men she had ever seen\nbecame qualified.",
    "He had interesting eyes.",
    "They were she thought\nmore deeply sunk in his head than any eyes she had seen.",
    "Deep\nquiet pools said Mrs Bantry to herself and felt like a romantic lady\nnovelist.",
    "The rest of his face was distinctly craggy almost\nludicrously out of proportion.",

    "Oh well dear dont fuss your head about it said Miss Knight\nsoothingly.",
    "I expect shell be ringing up again very shortly.",
    "Or\nwould you like me to get her for you\n\n\fNo thank you said Miss Marple.",

    "The tea had been properly made\nwith boiling water the egg had been boiled exactly three and threequarter minutes the toast was evenly browned the butter was\narranged in a nice little pat and the small jar of honey stood beside\nit.",
    "In many ways undeniably Miss Knight was a treasure.",
    "Miss\nMarple ate her breakfast and enjoyed it.",
    "Presently the whirr of a\nvacuum cleaner began below.",
    "Cherry had arrived.",
    "Competing with the whirr of the vacuum cleaner was a fresh tuneful\nvoice singing one of the latest popular tunes of the day.",
    "Miss\nKnight corning in for the breakfast tray shook her head.",
    "I really wish that young woman wouldnt go singing all over the\nhouse she said.",
    "Its not what I call respectful.",
    "Miss Marple smiled a little.",
    "It would never enter Cherrys head that\nshe would have to be respectful she remarked.",
    "Why should she\n\nMiss Knight sniffed and said Very different to what things used to\nbe.",
    "Naturally said Miss Marple.",
    "Times change.",
    "That is a thing which\nhas to be accepted.",
    "She added Perhaps youll ring up Mrs Bantry\nnow and find out what it was she wanted.",
    "Miss Knight bustled away.",
    "A minute or two later there was a rap on\nthe door and Cherry entered.",

    "What a shocking occurrence said Miss Marple.",
    "Did she suffer\nfrom heart trouble\n\nSound as a bell so they say Cherry said.",
    "Of course you never\nknow do you I suppose you can have something wrong with your\nheart and nobody knowing about it.",
    "Anyway I can tell you this.",
    "Theyve not sent her home.",

    "Looks funny to me she added.",
    "Now what do you mean by funny said Miss Marple.",
    "Well.",
    "Cherry considered.",
    "Funny.",
    "As though there was something\nbehind it.",
    "Is her husband terribly upset\n\n\fLooks as white as a sheet.",
    "Never saw a man as badly hit to look at\n that is to say.",
    "Miss Marples ears long attuned to delicate nuances led her to\ncock her head slightly on one side like an inquisitive bird.",
    "Was he so very devoted to her\n\nHe did what she told him and gave her her own way said Cherry\nbut that doesnt always mean youre devoted does it It may mean\nyou havent got the courage to stick up for yourself.",

    "And she\nwas always quite sure she knew the best thing to do.",
    "What they\nthought about it wouldnt have mattered.",
    "I had an aunt like that.",
    "Very fond of seed cake herself and she used to bake seed cakes for\npeople and take them to them and she never troubled to find out\nwhether they liked seed cake or not.",
    "There are people cant bear it\njust cant stand the flavour of caraway.",
    "Well Heather Badcock was\na bit like that.",
    "Yes said Miss Marple thoughtfully yes she would have been.",
    "I\nknew someone a little like that.",
    "Such people she added live\ndangerously  though they dont know it themselves.",
    "Cherry stared at her.",
    "Thats a funny thing to say.",
    "I dont quite get\nwhat you mean.",
    "Miss Knight bustled in.",
    "Mrs Bantry seems to have gone out she\nsaid.",
    "She didnt say where she was going.",
    "I can guess where shes going said Miss Marple.",
    "Shes coming\nhere.",
    "I shall get up now she added.",
    "II\n\nMiss Marple had just ensconced herself in her favourite chair by the\nwindow when Mrs Bantry arrived.",
    "She was slightly out of breath.",
    "Ive got plenty to tell you Jane she said.",
    "About the f\u043ate asked Miss Knight you went to the f\u043ate yesterday\ndidnt you I was there myself for a short time early in the\nafternoon.",
    "The tea tent was very crowded.",
    "An astonishing lot of\npeople seemed to be there.",
    "I didnt catch a glimpse of Marina\nGregg though which was rather disappointing.",
    "She flicked a little dust off a table and said brightly Now Im sure\nyou two want to have a nice little chat together and went out of the\nroom.",
    "She doesnt seem to know anything about it said Bantry.",
    "She fixed\nher friend with a keen glance.",
    "Jane I believe  you do know.",
    "You mean about the death yesterday\n\nYou always know everything said Mrs Bantry.",
    "I cannot think how.",
    "Well really dear said Miss Marple in the same way one always\nhas known everything.",
    "My daily helper Cherry Baker brought the\nnews.",
    "I expect the butcher will be telling Miss Knight presently.",
    "And what do you think of it said Mrs Bantry.",
    "What do I think of what said Miss Marple.",
    "Now dont be aggravating Jane you know perfectly what I mean.",
    "Theres this woman  whatever her name is \n\nHeather Badcock said Miss Marple.",
    "She arrives full of life and spirit.",
    "I was there when she came.",
    "And\nabout a quarter of an hour later she sits down in a chair says she\ndoesnt feel well gasps a bit and dies.",
    "What do you think of that\n\nOne mustnt jump to conclusions said Miss Marple.",
    "The point is of\ncourse what did a medical man think of it\n\n\fMrs Bantry nodded.",
    "Theres to be an inquest and a postmortem\nshe said.",
    "That shows what they think of it doesnt it\n\nNot necessarily said Miss Marple.",
    "Anyone may be taken ill and die\nsuddenly and they have to have a postmortem to find out the\ncause.",
    "Its more than that said Mrs Bantry.",
    "How do you know said Miss Marple.",
    "Dr Sandford went home and rang up the police.",
    "Who told you that said Miss Marple with great interest.",
    "Old Briggs said Mrs Bantry.",
    "At least he didnt tell me.",
    "You know\nhe goes down after hours in the evening to see to Dr Sandfords\ngarden and he was clipping something quite close to the study and\nhe heard the doctor ringing up the police station in Much Benham.",
    "Briggs told his daughter and his daughter mentioned it to the\npostwoman and she told me said Mrs Bantry.",
    "Miss Marple smiled.",
    "I see she said that St Mary Mead has not\nchanged very much from what it used to be.",
    "The grapevine is much the same agreed Mrs Bantry.",
    "Well now\nJane tell me what you think\n\n\fOne thinks of course of the husband said Miss Marple\nreflectively.",
    "Was he there\n\nYes he was there.",
    "You dont think it would be suicide said Mrs\nBantry.",
    "Certainly not suicide said Miss Marple decisively.",
    "She wasnt the\ntype.",
    "How did you come across her Jane\n\nIt was the day I went for a walk to the Development and fell down\nnear her house.",
    "She was kindness itself.",
    "She was a very kind\nwoman.",
    "Did you see the husband Did he look as though hed like to poison\nher\n\nYou know what I mean Mrs Bantry went on as Miss Marple showed\nsome slight signs of protesting.",
    "Did he remind you of Major Smith\nor Berrie Jones or someone youve known years ago who did\npoison a wife or tried to\n\nNo said Miss Marple he didnt remind me of anyone I know.",
    "She\nadded But she did.",
    "Who  Mrs Badcock\n\nYes said Miss Marple she reminded me of someone called Alison\nWilde.",
    "And what was Alison Wilde like\n\nShe didnt know at all said Miss Marple slowly what the world\nwas like.",
    "She didnt know what people were like.",
    "Shed never\nthought about them.",
    "And so you see she couldnt guard against\nthings happening to her.",
    "I dont really think I understand a word of what youre saying said\nMrs Bantry.",
    "Its\n\nvery\n\ndifficult\n\nto\n\nexplain\n\nexactly\n\nsaid\n\nMiss\n\nMarple\n\napologetically.",
    "It comes really from being selfcentred and I dont\nmean selfish by that she added.",
    "You can be kind and unselfish and\neven thoughtful.",
    "But if youre like Alison Wilde you never really\nknow what you may be doing.",
    "And so you never know what may\nhappen to you.",
    "Cant you make that a little clearer said Mrs Bantry.",
    "Well I suppose I could give you a sort of figurative example.",
    "This\nisnt anything that actually happened its just something Im\ninventing.",
    "Go on said Mrs Bantry.",
    "Well supposing you went into a shop say and you knew the\nproprietress had a son who was the spivvy young juvenile\ndelinquent type.",
    "He was there listening while you told his mother\nabout some money you had in the house or some silver or a piece\n\n\fof jewellery.",
    "It was something you were excited and pleased about\nand you wanted to talk about it.",
    "And you also perhaps mention an\nevening that you were going out.",
    "You even say that you never lock\nthe house.",
    "Youre interested in what youre saying what youre\ntelling her because its so very much in your mind.",
    "And then say\non that particular evening you come home because youve\nforgotten something and theres this bad lot of a boy in the house\ncaught in the act and he turns round and coshes you.",
    "That might happen to almost anybody nowadays said Mrs Bantry.",
    "Not quite said Miss Marple most people have a sense of\nprotection.",
    "They realise when its unwise to say or do something\nbecause of the person or persons who are taking in what you say\nand because of the kind of character that those people have.",
    "But as\nI say Alison Wilde never thought of anybody else but herself  She\nwas the sort of person who tells you what theyve done and what\ntheyve seen and what theyve felt and what theyve heard.",
    "They\nnever mention what any other people said or did.",
    "Life is a kind of\noneway track  just their own progress through it.",
    "Other people\nseem to them just like  like wallpaper in a room.",
    "She paused and\nthen said I think Heather Badcock was that kind of person.",
    "Mrs Bantry said You think she was the sort of person who might\nhave butted into something without knowing what she was doing\n\nAnd without realising that it was a dangerous thing to do said Miss\nMarple.",
    "She added Its the only reason I can possibly think of why\nshe should have been killed.",
    "If of course added Miss Marple we\nare right in assuming that murder has been commited.",
    "You dont think she was blackmailing someone Mrs Bantry\nsuggested.",
    "Oh no Miss Marple assured her.",
    "She was a kind good woman.",
    "Shed never have done anything of that kind.",
    "She added vexedly\nThe whole thing seems to me very unlikely.",
    "I suppose it cant have\nbeen \n\nWell Mrs Bantry urged her.",
    "I just wondered if it might have been the wrong murder said Miss\nMarple thoughtfully.",
    "The door opened and Dr Haydock breezed in Miss Knight twittering\nbehind him.",
    "Ah at it already I see said Dr Haydock looking at the two ladies.",
    "I came in to see how your health was he said to Miss Marple but I\nneednt ask.",
    "I see youve begun to adopt the treatment that I\nsuggested.",
    "Treatment Doctor\n\nDr Haydock pointed a finger at the knitting that lay on the table\nbeside her.",
    "Unravelling he said.",
    "Im right arent I\n\nMiss Marple twinkled very slightly in a discreet oldfashioned kind\nof way.",
    "You will have your joke Doctor Haydock she said.",
    "You cant pull the wool over my eyes my dear lady.",
    "Ive known you\ntoo many years.",
    "Sudden death at Gossington Hall and all the\ntongues of St. Mary Mead are wagging.",
    "Isnt that so Murder\nsuggested long before anybody even knows the result of the\ninquest.",
    "When is the inquest to be held asked Miss Marple.",
    "The day after tomorrow said Dr Haydock and by that time he\nsaid you ladies will have reviewed the whole story decided on the\nverdict and decided on a good many other points too I expect.",
    "Well he added I shant waste my time here.",
    "Its no good wasting\ntime on a patient that doesnt need my ministrations.",
    "Your cheeks\nare pink your eyes are bright youve begun to enjoy yourself.",
    "Nothing like having an interest in life.",
    "Ill be on my way.",
    "He stomped\nout again.",
    "Id rather have him than Sandford any day said Mrs Bantry.",
    "So would I added Miss Marple.",
    "Hes a good friend too she added\nthoughtfully.",
    "He came I think to give me the goahead sign.",
    "Then it was murder said Mrs Bantry.",
    "They looked at each other.",
    "At any rate the doctors think so.",
    "Miss Knight brought in cups of coffee.",
    "For once in their lives both\nladies were too impatient to welcome this interruption.",
    "When Miss Knight had gone Miss Marple started immediately.",
    "Now\nthen Dolly you were there \n\nI practically saw it happen said Mrs Bantry with modest pride.",
    "Splendid said Miss Marple.",
    "I mean  well you know what I mean.",
    "So you can tell me just exactly what happened from the moment she\narrived.",
    "Id been taken into the house said Mrs Bantry.",
    "Snob status.",
    "Who took you in\n\nOh a willowylooking young man.",
    "I think hes Marina Greggs\nsecretary or something like that.",
    "He took me in up the staircase.",
    "They were having a kind of reunion reception committee at the top\nof the stairs.",
    "On the landing said Miss Marple surprised.",
    "Oh theyve altered all that.",
    "Theyve knocked the dressingroom\nand bedroom down so that youve got a big sort of alcove\npractically a room.",
    "Its very attractive looking.",
    "I see.",
    "And who was there\n\nMarina Gregg being natural and charming looking lovely in a sort\nof willowy greygreen dress.",
    "And the husband of course and that\nwoman Ella Zielinsky I told you about.",
    "Shes their social secretary.",
    "And there were about  oh eight or ten people I should think.",
    "Some\n\n\fof them I knew some of them I didnt.",
    "Some I think were from the\nstudios  the ones I didnt know.",
    "There was the vicar and Doctor\nSandfords wife.",
    "He wasnt there himself until later and Colonel and\nMrs Clittering and the High Sheriff.",
    "And I think there was someone\nfrom the press there.",
    "And a young woman with a big camera taking\nphotographs.",
    "Miss Marple nodded.",
    "Go on.",
    "Heather Badcock and her husband arrived just after me.",
    "Marina\nGregg said nice things to me then to somebody else oh yes  the\nvicar  and then Heather Badcock and her husband came.",
    "Shes the\nsecretary you know of the St John Ambulance.",
    "Somebody said\nsomething about that and how hard she worked and how valuable\nshe was.",
    "And Marina Gregg said some pretty things.",
    "Then Mrs\nBadcock who struck me I must say Jane as rather a tiresome\nsort of woman began some long rigmarole of how years before\nshed met Marina Gregg somewhere.",
    "She wasnt awfully tactful\nabout it since she urged exactly how long ago and the year it was\nand everything like that.",
    "Im sure that actresses and film stars and\npeople dont really like being reminded of the exact age they are.",
    "Still she wouldnt think of that I suppose.",
    "No said Miss Marple she wasnt the kind of woman who would\nhave thought of that.",
    "Well\n\nWell there was nothing particular in that except for the fact that\nMarina Gregg didnt do her usual stuff.",
    "You mean she was annoyed\n\nNo no I dont mean that.",
    "As a matter of fact Im not at all sure that\nshe heard a word of it.",
    "She was staring you know over Mrs\nBadcocks shoulder and when Mrs Badcock had finished her rather\nsilly story of how she got out of a bed of sickness and sneaked out\nof the house to go and meet Marina and get her autograph there\nwas a sort of odd silence.",
    "Then I saw her face.",
    "Whose face Mrs Badcocks\n\nNo.",
    "Marina Greggs.",
    "It was as though she hadnt heard a word the\nBadcock woman was saying.",
    "She was staring over her shoulder\nright at the wall opposite.",
    "Staring with  I cant explain it to you \n\nBut do try Dolly said Miss Marple because I think perhaps that\nthis might be important.",
    "She had a kind of frozen look said Mrs Bantry struggling with\nwords as though shed seen something that  oh dear me how\nhard it is to describe things.",
    "Do you remember the Lady of Shalott\n\nThe mirror crackd from side to side\n\nThe doom has come upon me cried the Lady of Shalott.",
    "Well thats what she looked like.",
    "People laugh at Tennyson\nnowadays but the Lady of Shalott always thrilled me when I was\nyoung and it still does.",
    "She had a frozen look repeated Miss Marple thoughtfully.",
    "And she\nwas looking over Mrs Badcocks shoulder at the wall.",
    "What was on\nthe wall\n\nOh A picture of some kind I think said Mrs Bantry.",
    "You know\nItalian.",
    "I think it was a copy of a Bellini Madonna but Im not sure.",
    "A\npicture where the Virgin is holding up a laughing child.",
    "Miss Marple frowned.",
    "I cant see that a picture could give her that\nexpression.",
    "Especially as she must see it every day agreed Mrs Bantry.",
    "There were people coming up the stairs still I suppose\n\nOh yes there were.",
    "Who were they do you remember\n\nYou mean she might have been looking at one of the people coming\nup the stairs\n\nWell its possible isnt it said Miss Marple.",
    "Yes  of course  Now let me see.",
    "There was the mayor all dressed\nup too with his chains and all and his wife and there was a man\n\n\fwith long hair and one of those funny beards they wear nowadays.",
    "Quite a young man.",
    "And there was the girl with the camera.",
    "Shed\ntaken her position on the stairs so as to get photos of people\ncoming up and having their hands shaken by Marina and  let me\nsee two people I didnt know.",
    "Studio people I think and the Grices\nfrom Lower Farm.",
    "There may have been others but thats all I can\nremember now.",
    "Doesnt sound very promising said Miss Marple.",
    "What happened\nnext\n\nI think Jason Rudd nudged her or something because all of a\nsudden she seemed to pull herself together and she smiled at Mrs\nBadcock and she began to say all the usual things.",
    "You know\nsweet unspoilt natural charming the usual bag of tricks.",
    "And then\n\nAnd then Jason Rudd gave them drinks.",
    "What kind of drinks\n\nDaiquiris I think.",
    "He said they were his wifes favourites.",
    "He gave\none to her and one to the Badcock woman.",
    "Thats very interesting said Miss Marple.",
    "Very interesting indeed.",
    "And what happened after that\n\n\fI dont know because I took a gaggle of women to look at the\nbathrooms.",
    "The next thing I knew was when the secretary woman\ncame rushing along and said someone had been taken ill.\n\nChapter 7\n\nThe inquest when it was held was short and disappointing.",
    "Evidence of identification was given by the husband and the only\nother evidence was medical.",
    "Heather Badcock had died as a result\nof four grains of hyethyldexylbarboquindelorytate or let us be\nfrank some such name.",
    "There was no evidence to show how the\ndrug was administered.",
    "The inquest was adjourned for a fortnight.",
    "After it was concluded DetectiveInspector Frank Cornish joined\nArthur Badcock.",
    "Could I have a word with you Mr Badcock\n\nOf course of course.",
    "Arthur Badcock looked more like a chewedout bit of string than\never.",
    "I cant understand it he muttered.",
    "I simply cant understand\nit.",
    "Ive got a car here said Cornish.",
    "Well drive back to your house\nshall we Nicer and more private there.",
    "Thank you sir.",
    "Yes yes Im sure that would be much better.",
    "They drew up at the neat little bluepainted gate of No.",
    "3 Arlington\nClose.",
    "Arthur Badcock led the way and the inspector followed him.",
    "He drew out his latchkey but before he had inserted it into the\ndoor it was opened from inside.",
    "The woman who opened it stood\nback looking slightly embarrassed.",
    "Arthur Badcock looked startled.",
    "Mary he said.",
    "I was just getting you ready some tea Arthur.",
    "I thought youd need\nit when you came back from the inquest.",
    "Thats very kind of you Im sure said Arthur Badcock gratefully.",
    "Er  he hesitated.",
    "This is Inspector Cornish Mrs Bain Shes a\nneighbour of mine.",
    "I see said Inspector Cornish.",
    "Ill get another cup said Mrs Bain.",
    "She disappeared and rather doubtfully Arthur Badcock showed the\ninspector into the bright cretonnecovered sittingroom to the right\nof the hall.",
    "Shes very kind said Arthur Badcock.",
    "Very kind always.",
    "Youve known her a long time\n\n\fOh no.",
    "Only since we came here.",
    "Youve been here two years I believe or is it three\n\nJust about three now said Arthur.",
    "Mrs Bain only got here six\nmonths ago he explained.",
    "Her son works near here and so after\nher husbands death she came down to live here and he boards\nwith her.",
    "Mrs Bain appeared at this point bringing the tray from the kitchen.",
    "She was a dark rather intenselooking woman of about forty years\nof age.",
    "She had gipsy colouring that went with her dark hair and\neyes.",
    "There was something a little odd about her eyes.",
    "They had a\nwatchful look.",
    "She put down the tray on the table and Inspector\nCornish said something pleasant and noncommittal.",
    "Something in\nhim some professional instinct was on the alert.",
    "The watchful look\nin the womans eyes the slight start she had given when Arthur\nintroduced him had not passed unnoticed.",
    "He was familiar with that\nslight uneasiness in the presence of the police.",
    "There were two\nkinds of uneasiness.",
    "One was the kind of natural alarm and distrust\nas of those who might have offended unwittingly against the\nmajesty of the law but there was a second kind.",
    "And it was the\nsecond kind that he felt sure was present here.",
    "Mrs Bain he\nthought had had at some time some connection with the police\nsomething that had left her wary and ill at ease.",
    "He made a mental\nnote to find out a little more about Mary Bain.",
    "Having set down the\ntea tray and refused to partake herself saying she had to get home\nshe departed.",
    "Seems a nice woman said Inspector Cornish.",
    "Yes indeed.",
    "Shes very kind a very good neighbour a very\nsympathetic woman said Arthur Badcock.",
    "Was she a great friend of your wife\n\nNo.",
    "No I wouldnt say that.",
    "They were neighbourly and on pleasant\nterms.",
    "Nothing special about it though.",
    "I see.",
    "Now Mr Badcock we want as much information as we can\nfrom you.",
    "The findings of the inquest have been a shock to you I\nexpect\n\nOh they have Inspector.",
    "Of course I realized that you must think\nsomething was wrong and I almost thought so myself because\nHeather has always been such a healthy woman.",
    "Practically never\na days illness.",
    "I said to myself There must be something wrong.",
    "But it seems so incredible if you understand what I mean\nInspector.",
    "Really quite incredible.",
    "What is this stuff  this Biethylhex  he came to a stop.",
    "There is an easier name for it said the inspector.",
    "Its sold under a\ntrade name the trade name of Calmo.",
    "Ever come across it\n\nArthur Badcock shook his head perplexed.",
    "Its more used in America than here said the inspector.",
    "They prescribe it very freely over there I understand.",
    "Whats it for\n\nIt induces or so I understand a happy and tranquil state of mind\nsaid Cornish.",
    "Its prescribed for those under strain suffering\nanxiety depression melancholy sleeplessness and a good many\nother things.",
    "The properly prescribed dose is not dangerous but\noverdoses are not to be advised.",
    "It would seem that your wife took\nsomething like six times the ordinary dose.",
    "Badcock stared.",
    "Heather never took anything like that in her life\nhe said.",
    "Im sure of it.",
    "She wasnt one for taking medicines anyway.",
    "She was never depressed or worried.",
    "She was one of the most\ncheerful women you could possibly imagine.",
    "The inspector nodded.",
    "I see.",
    "And no doctor had prescribed\nanything of this kind for her\n\nNo.",
    "Certainly not.",
    "Im sure of that.",
    "Who was her doctor\n\nShe was on Dr Simss panel but I dont think shes been to him\nonce since weve been here.",
    "Inspector Cornish said thoughtfully So she doesnt seem the kind\nof woman to have been likely to need such a thing or to have taken\nit\n\nShe didnt Inspector Im sure she didnt.",
    "She must have taken it by\na mistake of some kind.",
    "Its a very difficult mistake to make said Inspector Cornish.",
    "What\ndid she have to eat and drink that afternoon\n\nWell let me see.",
    "For lunch \n\nYou neednt go back as far as lunch said Cornish.",
    "Given in such\nquantity the drug would act quickly and suddenly.",
    "Tea.",
    "Go back to\ntea.",
    "Well we went into the marquee in the grounds.",
    "It was a terrible\nscram in there but we managed in the end to get a bun each and a\ncup of tea.",
    "We finished it as quickly as possible bemuse it was very\nhot in the marquee and we came out again.",
    "And thats all she had a bun and cup off tea there\n\nThats right sir.",
    "And after that you went into the house.",
    "Is that right\n\nYes.",
    "The young lady came and said that Mrs Marina Gregg would\nbe very pleased to see my wife if she would like to come into the\nhouse.",
    "Of course my wife was delighted.",
    "She had been talking\nabout Marina Gregg for days... Everybody was excited.",
    "Oh well you\nknow that inspector as well as anyone does.",
    "Yes indeed said Cornish.",
    "My wife was excited too.",
    "Why from all\naround people were paying their shilling to go in and see\n\n\fGossington Hall and what had been done there and hoped to catch\na glimpse of Marina Gregg herself.",
    "The young lady took us into the house said Arthur Badcock and\nup the stairs.",
    "Thats where the party was.",
    "On the landing up there.",
    "But it looked quite different from what it used to look like so I\nunderstand.",
    "It was more like a room a sort of big hollowed out\nplace with chairs and tables with drinks on them.",
    "There were about\nten or twelve people there I suppose.",
    "Inspector Cornish nodded.",
    "And you were received there by\nwhom\n\nBy Miss Marina Gregg herself.",
    "Her husband was with her.",
    "Ive\nforgotten his name now.",
    "Jason Rudd said Inspector Cornish.",
    "Oh yes not that I noticed him at first.",
    "Well anyway Miss Gregg\ngreeted Heather very nicely and seemed very pleased to see her\nand Heather was talking and telling a story of how shed once met\nMiss Gregg years ago in the West Indies and everything seemed as\nright as rain.",
    "Everything seemed as right as rain echoed the inspector.",
    "And\nthen\n\nAnd then Miss Gregg said what would we have And Miss Greggs\nhusband Mr Rudd got Heather a kind of cocktail a dickery or\nsomething like that.",
    "A daiquiri.",
    "That s right sir.",
    "He brought two.",
    "One for her and one for Miss\nGregg.",
    "And you what did you have\n\nI had a sherry.",
    "I see.",
    "And you three stood there drinking together\n\nWell not quite like that.",
    "You see there were more people coming\nup the stairs.",
    "There was the mayor for one and some other people\n an American gentleman and lady I think  so we moved off a bit.",
    "And your wife drank her daiquiri then\n\nWell no not then she didnt.",
    "Well if she didnt drink it then when did she drink it\n\nArthur Badcock stood frowning in remembrance.",
    "I think she set it\ndown on one of the tables.",
    "She saw some friends there.",
    "I think it\nwas someone to do with the St Johns Ambulance whod driven over\nthere from Much Benham or somewhere like that.",
    "Anyway they got\nto talking together.",
    "And when did she drink her drink\n\n\fArthur Badcock again frowned.",
    "It was a little after that he said.",
    "It\nwas getting rather more crowded by then.",
    "Somebody jogged\nHeathers elbow her glass got spilt.",
    "Whats that Inspector Cornish looked up sharply.",
    "Her glass was\nspilt\n\nYes thats how I remember it...",
    "Shed picked it up and I think she\ntook a little sip and made rather a face.",
    "She didnt really like\ncocktails you know but all the same she wasnt going to be\ndowned by that.",
    "Anyway as she stood there somebody jogged her\nelbow and the glass spilled over.",
    "It went down her dress and I think\nit went on Miss Greggs dress too.",
    "Miss Gregg couldnt have been\nnicer.",
    "She said it didnt matter at all and it would make no stain and\nshe gave Heather her handkerchief to wipe up Heathers dress and\nthen she passed over the drink she was holding and said Have\nthis I havent touched it yet.",
    "She handed over her own drink did she said the inspector.",
    "Youre quite sure of that\n\nArthur Badcock paused a moment while he thought.",
    "Yes Im quite\nsure of that he said.",
    "And your wife took the drink\n\nWell she didnt want to at first sir.",
    "She said Oh no I couldnt do\nthat and Miss Gregg laughed and said Ive had far too much to\ndrink already.",
    "And so your wife took that glass and did what with it\n\nShe turned away a little and drank it rather quickly I think.",
    "And\nthen we walked a little way along the corridor looking at some of\nthe pictures and the curtains.",
    "Lovely curtain stuff it was like\nnothing wed seen before.",
    "Then I met a pal of mine Councillor\nAllcock and I was just passing the time of day with him when I\nlooked round and saw Heather was sitting on a chair looking rather\nodd so I came to her and said Whats the matter She said she\nfelt a little queer.",
    "What kind of queerness\n\nI dont know sir.",
    "I didnt have time.",
    "Her voice sounded very queer\nand thick and her head was rolling a little.",
    "All of a sudden she made\na great half gasp and her head fell forward.",
    "She was dead sir\ndead.",
    "Chapter 8\n\nSt Mary Mead you say ChiefInspector Craddock looked up\nsharply.",
    "The assistant commissioner was a little surprised.",
    "Yes he said St Mary Mead.",
    "Why Does it \n\nNothing really said Dermot Craddock.",
    "Its quite a small place I understand went on the other.",
    "Though of\ncourse theres a great deal of building development going on there\nnow.",
    "Practically all the way from St Mary Mead to Much Benham I\nunderstand.",
    "Hellingforth Studios he added are on the other side\nof St Mary Mead towards Market Basing.",
    "He was still looking\nslightly inquiring.",
    "Dermot Craddock felt that he should perhaps\nexplain.",
    "I know someone living there he said.",
    "At St Mary Mead.",
    "An old\nlady.",
    "A very old lady by now.",
    "Perhaps shes dead I dont know.",
    "But\nif not \n\nThe assistant commissioner took his subordinates point or at any\nrate he thought he did.",
    "Yes he said it would give you an in in a way.",
    "One needs a bit of\nlocal gossip.",
    "The whole thing is a curious business.",
    "The County have called us in Dermot asked.",
    "Yes.",
    "Ive got the chief constables letter here.",
    "They dont seem to\nfeel that its necessarily a local affair.",
    "The largest house in the\nneighbourhood Gossington Hall was recently sold as a residence\nfor Marina Gregg the film star and her husband.",
    "Theyre shooting\na film at their new studios at Hellingforth in which she is starring.",
    "A f\u043ate was held in the grounds in aid of the St John Ambulance.",
    "The\ndead woman  her name is Mrs Heather Badcock  was the local\nsecretary of this and had done most of the administrative work for\n\n\fthe f\u043ate.",
    "She seems to have been a competent sensible person\nwell liked locally.",
    "One of those bossy women suggested Craddock.",
    "Very possibly said the assistant commissioner.",
    "Still in my\nexperience bossy women seldom get themselves murdered.",
    "I cant\nthink why not.",
    "When you come to think of it its rather a pity.",
    "There\nwas a record attendance at the f\u043ate it seems good weather\neverything running to plan.",
    "Marina Gregg and her husband held a\nkind of small private reception in Gossington Hall.",
    "About thirty or\nforty people attended this.",
    "The local notables various people\nconnected with the St John Ambulance Association several friends\nof Marina Gregg herself and a few people connected with the\nstudios.",
    "All very peaceful nice and happy.",
    "But fantastically and\nimprobably Heather Badcock was poisoned there.",
    "Dermot Craddock said thoughtfully An odd place to choose.",
    "Thats the chief constables point of view.",
    "If anyone wanted to\npoison Heather Badcock why choose that particular afternoon and\ncircumstances Hundreds of much simpler ways of doing it.",
    "A risky\nbusiness anyway you know to slip a dose of deadly poison into a\ncocktail in the middle of twenty or thirty people milling about.",
    "Somebody ought to have seen something.",
    "It definitely was in the drink\n\n\fYes it was definitely in the drink.",
    "We have the particulars here.",
    "One of those inexplicable names that doctors delight in but\nactually a fairly common prescription in America.",
    "In America.",
    "I see.",
    "Oh this country too.",
    "But these things are handed out much more\nfreely on the other side of the Atlantic.",
    "Taken in small doses\nbeneficial.",
    "Supplied on prescription or can it be bought freely\n\nNo.",
    "You have to have a prescription.",
    "Yes its odd said Dermot.",
    "Did Heather Badcock have any\nconnection with these film people\n\nNone whatever.",
    "Any member of her own family at this do\n\nHer husband.",
    "Her husband said Dermot thoughtfully.",
    "Yes one always thinks that way agreed his superior officer but\nthe local man  Cornish I think his name is  doesnt seem to think\ntheres anything in that although he does report that Badcock\nseemed ill at ease and nervous but he agrees that respectable\n\n\fpeople often are like that when interviewed by the police.",
    "They\nappear to have been quite a devoted couple.",
    "In other words the police there dont think its their pigeon.",
    "Well it\nought to be interesting.",
    "I take it Im going down there sir\n\nYes.",
    "Better get there as soon as possible Dermot.",
    "Who do you\nwant with you\n\nDermot considered for a moment or two.",
    "Tiddler I think he said thoughtfully.",
    "Hes a good man and whats\nmore hes a film fan.",
    "That might come in useful.",
    "The assistant commissioner nodded.",
    "Good luck to you he said.",
    "II\n\nWell exclaimed Miss Marple going pink with pleasure and\nsurprise.",
    "This is a surprise.",
    "How are you my dear boy though\nyoure hardly a boy now.",
    "What are you  a Chief Inspector or this\nnew thing they call a Commander\n\nDermot explained his present rank.",
    "I suppose I need hardly ask what you are doing down here said\nMiss Marple.",
    "Our local murder is considered worthy of the\nattention of Scotland Yard.",
    "They handed it over to us said Dermot and so naturally as soon\nas I got down here I came to headquarters.",
    "Do you mean  Miss Marple fluttered a little.",
    "Yes Aunty said Dermot disrespectfully.",
    "I mean you.",
    "Im afraid said Miss Marple regretfully Im very much out of things\nnowadays.",
    "I dont get out much.",
    "You get out enough to fall down and be picked up by a woman\nwhos going to be murdered ten days later said Dermot Craddock.",
    "Miss Marple made the kind of noise that would once have been\nwritten down as tuttut.",
    "I dont know where you hear these things she said.",
    "You should know said Dermot Craddock.",
    "You told me yourself\nthat in a village everybody knows everything.",
    "And just off the record he added did you think she was going to\nbe murdered as soon as you looked at her\n\nOf course not of course not exclaimed Miss Marple.",
    "What an\nidea\n\n\fYou didnt see that look in her husbands eye that reminded you of\nHarry Simpson or David Jones or somebody youve known years\nago and subsequently pushed his wife off a precipice.",
    "No I did not said Miss Marple.",
    "Im sure Mr Badcock would never\ndo a wicked thing of that kind.",
    "At least she added thoughtfully Im\nnearly sure.",
    "But human nature being what it is  murmured Craddock wickedly.",
    "Exactly said Miss Marple.",
    "She added I daresay after the first\nnatural grief he wont miss her very much...\n\nWhy Did she bully him\n\nOh no said Miss Marple but I dont think that she  well she\nwasnt a considerate woman.",
    "Kind yes.",
    "Considerate  no.",
    "She\nwould be fond of him and look after him when he was ill and see to\nhis meals and be a good housekeeper but I dont think she would\never  well that she would ever even know what he might be feeling\nor thinking.",
    "That makes rather a lonely life for a man.",
    "Ah said Dermot and is his life less likely to be lonely in future\n\nI expect hell marry again said Miss Marple.",
    "Perhaps quite soon.",
    "And probably which is such a pity a woman of much the same\ntype.",
    "I mean hell marry someone with a stronger personality than\nhis own.",
    "Anyone in view asked Dermot.",
    "Not that I know of said Miss Marple.",
    "She added regretfully But I\nknow so little.",
    "Well what do you think urged Dermot Craddock.",
    "Youve never\nbeen backward in thinking things.",
    "I think said Miss Marple unexpectedly that you ought to go and\nsee Mrs Bantry.",
    "Mrs Bantry Who is she One of the film lot\n\nNo said Miss Marple she lives in the East Lodge at Gossington.",
    "She was at the party that day.",
    "She used to own Gossington at one\ntime.",
    "She and her husband Colonel Bantry.",
    "She was at the party.",
    "And she saw something\n\nI think she must tell you herself what it was she saw.",
    "You maynt\nthink it has any bearing on the matter but I think it might be  just\nmight be  suggestive.",
    "Tell her I sent you to her and  ah yes\nperhaps youd better just mention the Lady of Shalott.",
    "Dermot Craddock looked at her with his head just slightly on one\nside.",
    "The Lady of Shalott he said.",
    "Those are the code words are they\n\nI dont know that I should put it that way said Miss Marple but it\nwill remind her of what I mean.",
    "Dermot Craddock got up.",
    "I shall be back he warned her.",
    "That is very nice of you said Miss Marple.",
    "Perhaps if you have\ntime you would come and have tea with me one day.",
    "If you still\ndrink tea she added rather wistfully.",
    "I know that so many young\npeople nowadays only go out to drinks and things.",
    "They think that\nafternoon tea is a very outmoded affair.",
    "Im not as young as all that said Dermot Craddock.",
    "Yes Ill come\nand have tea with you one day.",
    "Well have tea and gossip and talk\nabout the village.",
    "Do you know any of the film stars by the way or\nany of the studio lot\n\nNot a thing said Miss Marple except what I hear she added.",
    "Well you usually hear a good deal said Dermot Craddock.",
    "Goodbye.",
    "Its been very nice to see you.",
    "III\n\nOh how do you do said Mrs Bantry looking slightly taken aback\nwhen Dermot Craddock had introduced himself and explained who\nhe was.",
    "How very exciting to see you.",
    "Dont you always have\nsergeants with you\n\nIve got a sergeant down here yes said Craddock.",
    "But hes busy.",
    "On routine enquiries asked Mrs Bantry hopefully.",
    "Something of the kind said Dermot gravely.",
    "And Jane Marple sent you to me said Mrs Bantry as she ushered\nhim into her small sittingroom.",
    "I was just arranging some flowers\nshe explained.",
    "Its one of those days when flowers wont do\nanything you want them to.",
    "They fall out or stick up where they\nshouldnt stick up or wont lie down where you want them to lie\ndown.",
    "So Im thankful to have a distraction and especially such an\nexciting one.",
    "So it really was murder was it\n\nDid you think it was murder\n\nWell it could have been an accident I suppose said Mrs Bantry\nNobodys said anything definite officially that is.",
    "Just that rather\nsilly piece about no evidence to show by whom or in what way the\npoison was administered.",
    "But of course we all talk about it as\nmurder.",
    "And about who did it\n\nThats the odd part of it said Mrs Bantry.",
    "We dont.",
    "Because I\nreally dont see who can have done it.",
    "You mean as a matter of definite physical fact you dont see who\ncould have done it\n\nWell no not that.",
    "I suppose it would have been difficult but not\nimpossible.",
    "No I mean I dont see who could have wanted to do it.",
    "Nobody you think could have wanted to kill Heather Badcock\n\nWell frankly said Mrs Bantry I cant imagine anybody wanting to\nkill Heather Badcock.",
    "Ive seen her quite a few times on local\nthings you know.",
    "Girl guides and the St John Ambulance and\nvarious parish things.",
    "I found her a rather trying sort of woman.",
    "Very enthusiastic about everything and a bit given to overstatement and just a little bit of a gusher.",
    "But you dont want to\nmurder people for that.",
    "She was the kind of woman who in the old\ndays if youd seen her approaching the front door youd have\nhurried out to say to your parlourmaid  which was an institution we\nhad in those days and very useful too  and told her to say not at\nhome or not at home to visitors if she had conscientious\nscruples about the truth.",
    "You mean that one might take pains to avoid Mrs Badcock but one\nwould have no urge to remove her permanently.",
    "Very well put said Mrs Bantry nodding approval.",
    "She had no money to speak of mused Dermot so nobody stood to\ngain by her death.",
    "Nobody seems to have disliked her to the point of\nhatred.",
    "I dont suppose she was blackmailing anybody\n\nShe wouldnt have dreamed of doing such a thing Im sure said\nMrs Bantry.",
    "She was the conscientious and highprincipled kind.",
    "And her husband wasnt having an affair with someone else\n\n\fI shouldnt think so said Mrs Bantry I only saw him at the party.",
    "He looked like a bit of chewed string.",
    "Nice but wet.",
    "Doesnt leave much does it said Dermot Craddock.",
    "One falls\nback on the assumption she knew something.",
    "Knew something\n\nTo the detriment of somebody else.",
    "Mrs Bantry shook her head again.",
    "I doubt it she said.",
    "I doubt it\nvery much.",
    "She struck me as the kind of woman who if she had\nknown anything about anyone couldnt have helped talking about\nit.",
    "Well that washes that out said Dermot Craddock so well come\nif we may to my reasons for coming to see you.",
    "Miss Marple for\nwhom I have the greatest admiration and respect told me that I\nwas to say to you the Lady of Shalott.",
    "Oh that said Mrs Bantry.",
    "Yes said Craddock.",
    "That Whatever it is.",
    "People dont read much Tennyson nowadays said Mrs Bantry.",
    "A few echoes come back to me said Dermot Craddock.",
    "She\nlooked out to Camelot didnt she\n\n\fOut flew the web and floated wide\n\nThe Mirror crackd from side to side\n\nThe curse has come upon me cried\n\nThe Lady of Shalott.",
    "Exactly.",
    "She did said Mrs Bantry.",
    "I beg your pardon.",
    "Who did Did what\n\nLooked like that said Mrs Bantry.",
    "Who looked like what\n\nMarina Gregg.",
    "Ah Marina Gregg.",
    "When was this\n\nDidnt Jane Marple tell you\n\nShe didnt tell me anything.",
    "She sent me to you.",
    "Thats tiresome of her said Mrs Bantry because she can always\ntell things better than I can.",
    "My husband always used to say that I\nwas so abrupt that he didnt know what I was talking about.",
    "Anyway it may have been only my fancy.",
    "But when you see anyone\nlooking like that you cant help remembering it.",
    "Please tell me said Dermot Craddock.",
    "Well it was at the party.",
    "I call it a party because what can one call\nthings But it was just a sort of reception up at the top of the stairs\nwhere theyve made a kind of recess.",
    "Marina Gregg was there and\nher husband.",
    "They fetched some of us in.",
    "They fetched me I\nsuppose because I once owned the house and they fetched\nHeather Badcock and her husband because shed done all the\nrunning of the f\u043ate and the arrangements.",
    "And we happened to go\nup the stairs at about the same time so I was standing there you\nsee when I noticed it.",
    "Quite.",
    "When you noticed what\n\nWell Mrs Badcock went into a long spiel as people do when they\nmeet celebrities.",
    "You know how wonderful it was and what a thrill\nand theyd always hoped to see them.",
    "And she went into a long\nstory of how shed once met her years ago and how exciting it had\nbeen.",
    "And I thought in my own mind you know what a bore it must\nbe for these poor celebrities to have to say all the right things.",
    "And\nthen I noticed that Marina Gregg wasnt saying the right things.",
    "She\nwas just staring.",
    "Staring  at Mrs Badcock\n\nNo  no it looked as though shed forgotten Mrs Badcock\naltogether.",
    "I mean I dont believe shed even heard what Mrs\nBadcock was saying.",
    "She was just staring with what I call this Lady\nof Shalott look as though shed seen something awful.",
    "Something\n\n\ffrightening something that she could hardly believe she saw and\ncouldnt bear to see.",
    "The curse has come upon me suggested Dermot Craddock.",
    "Yes just that.",
    "Thats why I call it the Lady of Shalott look.",
    "But what was she looking at Mrs Bantry\n\nWell I wish I knew said Mrs Bantry.",
    "She was at the top of the stairs you say\n\nShe was looking over Mrs Badcocks head  no more over one\nshoulder I think.",
    "Straight at the middle of the staircase\n\nIt might have been a little to one side.",
    "And there were people coming up the staircase\n\nOh yes I should think about five or six people.",
    "Was she looking at one of these people in particular\n\nI cant possibly tell said Mrs Bantry.",
    "You see I wasnt facing that\nway.",
    "I was looking at her.",
    "My back was to the stairs.",
    "I thought\nperhaps she was looking at one of the pictures.",
    "But she must know the pictures quite well if shes living in the\nhouse.",
    "Yes yes of course.",
    "No I suppose she must have been looking at\none of the people.",
    "I wonder which.",
    "We have to try and find out said Dermot Craddock.",
    "Can you\nremember at all who the people were\n\nWell I know the mayor was one of them with his wife.",
    "There was\nsomeone who I think was a reporter with red hair because I was\nintroduced to him later but I cant remember his name.",
    "I never hear\nnames.",
    "Galbraith  something like that.",
    "Then there was a big black\nman.",
    "I dont mean a negro  I just mean very dark forceful looking.",
    "And an actress with him.",
    "A bit overblonde and the minky kind.",
    "And\nold General Barnstaple from Much Benham.",
    "Hes practically gaga\nnow poor old man.",
    "I dont think he could have been anybodys\ndoom.",
    "Oh and the Grices from the farm.",
    "Those are all the people you can remember\n\nWell there may have been others.",
    "But you see I wasnt well I mean\nI wasnt noticing particularly.",
    "I know that the mayor and General\nBarnstaple and the Americans did arrive about that time.",
    "And there\nwere people taking photographs.",
    "One I think was a local man and\nthere was a girl from London an artylooking girl with long hair and\na rather large camera.",
    "And you think it was one of those people who brought that look to\nMarina Greggs face\n\n\fI didnt really think anything said Mrs Bantry with complete\nfrankness.",
    "I just wondered what on earth made her look like that\nand then I didnt think of it any more.",
    "But afterwards one\nremembers about these things.",
    "But of course added Mrs Bantry\nwith honesty I may have imagined it.",
    "After all she may have had a\nsudden toothache or a safety pin run into her or a sudden violent\ncolic.",
    "The sort of thing where you try to go on as usual and not to\nshow anything but your face cant help looking awful.",
    "Dermot Craddock laughed.",
    "Im glad to see youre a realist Mrs\nBantry he said.",
    "As you say it may have been something of that\nkind.",
    "But its certainly just one interesting little fact that might be a\npointer.",
    "He shook his head and departed to present his official credentials\nin Much Benham.",
    "Chapter 9\n\nSo locally youve drawn a blank said Craddock offering his\ncigarette case to Frank Cornish.",
    "Completely said Cornish.",
    "No enemies no quarrels on good terms\nwith her husband.",
    "No question of another woman or another man\n\n\fThe other shook his head.",
    "Nothing of that kind.",
    "No hint of scandal\nanywhere.",
    "She wasnt what youd call the sexy kind.",
    "She was on a\nlot of committees and things like that and there were some small\nlocal rivalries but nothing beyond that.",
    "There wasnt anyone else the husband wanted to marry No one in\nthe office where he worked\n\nHes in Biddle  Russell the estate agents and valuers.",
    "Theres\nFlorrie West with adenoids and Miss Grundle who is at least fifty\nand as plain as a haystack  nothing much there to excite a man.",
    "Though for all that I shouldnt be surprised if he did marry again\nsoon.",
    "Craddock looked interested.",
    "A neighbour explained Cornish.A widow.",
    "When I went back with\nhim from the inquest shed gone in and was making him tea and\nlooking after him generally.",
    "He seemed surprised and grateful.",
    "If\nyou ask me shes made up her mind to marry him but he doesnt\nknow it yet poor chap.",
    "What sort of a woman is she\n\nGood looking admitted the other.",
    "Not young but handsome in a\ngipsyish sort of way.",
    "High colour.",
    "Dark eyes.",
    "Whats her name\n\nBain.",
    "Mrs Mary Bain.",
    "Mary Bain.",
    "Shes a widow.",
    "Whatd her husband do\n\nNo idea.",
    "Shes got a son working near here who lives with her.",
    "She\nseems a quiet respectable woman.",
    "All the same Ive a feeling Ive\nseen her before.",
    "He looked at his watch.",
    "Ten to twelve.",
    "Ive made\nan appointment for you at Gossington Hall at twelve oclock.",
    "Wed\nbest be going.",
    "II\n\nDermot Craddocks eyes which always looked gently inattentive\nwere in actuality making a close mental note of the features of\nGossington Hall.",
    "Inspector Cornish had taken him there had\ndelivered him over to a young man called Harley Preston and had\nthen taken a tactful leave.",
    "Since then Dermot Craddock had been\ngently nodding at Mr Preston.",
    "Hailey Preston he gathered was a\nkind of public relations or personal assistant or private secretary\nor more likely a mixture of all three to Jason Rudd.",
    "He talked.",
    "He\ntalked freely and at length without much modulation and managing\nmiraculously not to repeat himself too often.",
    "He was a pleasant\nyoung man anxious that his own views reminiscent of those of Dr\nPangloss that all was for the best in the best of all possible worlds\nshould be shared by anyone in whose company he happened to be.",
    "He said several times and in different ways what a terrible shame\nthis had been how worried everyone had been how Marina was\nabsolutely prostrated how Mr Rudd was more upset than he could\npossibly say how it absolutely beat anything that a thing like that\n\n\fshould happen didnt it Possibly there might have been some kind\nof allergy to some particular kind of substance He just put that\nforward as an idea  allergies were extraordinary things.",
    "ChiefInspector Craddock was to count on every possible cooperation\nthat Hellingforth Studios or any of their staff could give.",
    "He was to\nask any questions he wanted go anywhere he liked.",
    "If they could\nhelp in any way they would do so.",
    "They all had had the greatest\nrespect for Mrs Badcock and appreciated her strong social sense\nand the valuable work she had done for the St John Ambulance\nAssociation.",
    "He then started again not in the same words but using the same\nmotifs.",
    "No one could have been more eagerly cooperative.",
    "At the\nsame time he endeavoured to convey how very far this was from\nthe cellophane world of studios and Mr Jason Rudd and Miss\nMarina Gregg or any of the people in the house who surely were\ngoing to do their utmost to help in any way they possibly could.",
    "Then he nodded gently some fortyfour times.",
    "Dermot Craddock\ntook advantage of the pause to say\n\nThank you very much.",
    "It was said quietly but with a kind of finality that brought Mr Hailey\nPreston up with a jerk.",
    "He said\n\nWell  and paused inquiringly.",
    "You said I might ask questions\n\nSure.",
    "Sure.",
    "Fire ahead.",
    "Is this the place where she died\n\nMrs Badcock\n\nMrs Badcock.",
    "Is this the place\n\nYes sure.",
    "Right here.",
    "At least well actually I can show you the\nchair.",
    "They were standing on the landing recess.",
    "Hailey Preston walked a\nshort way along the corridor and pointed out a rather phonylooking oak armchair.",
    "She was sitting right there he said.",
    "She said she didnt feel well.",
    "Someone went to get her something and then she just died right\nthere.",
    "I see.",
    "I dont know if shed seen a physician lately.",
    "If shed been warned\nthat she had anything wrong with her heart \n\nShe had nothing wrong with her heart said Dermot Craddock.",
    "She was a healthy woman.",
    "She died of six times the maximum dose\nof a substance whose official name I will not try to pronounce but\nwhich I understand is generally known as Calmo.",
    "I know I know said Hailey Preston.",
    "I take it myself sometimes.",
    "Indeed Thats very interesting.",
    "You find it has a good effect\n\nMarvellous.",
    "Marvellous.",
    "It bucks you up and it soothes you down if\nyou understand what I mean.",
    "Naturally he added you would have\nto take it in the proper dosage.",
    "Would there be supplies of this substance in the house\n\nHe knew the answer to the question but he put it as though he did\nnot.",
    "Hailey Prestons answer was frankness itself.",
    "Loads of it I should say.",
    "Therell be a bottle of it in most of the\nbathroom cupboards here.",
    "Which doesnt make our task easier.",
    "Of course said Hailey Preston she might have used the stuff\nherself and taken a dose and as I say had an allergy.",
    "Craddock looked unconvinced  Hailey Preston sighed and said\n\nYoure quite definite about the dosage\n\nOh yes.",
    "It was a lethal dose and Mrs Badcock did not take any such\nthings herself.",
    "As far as we can make out the only things she ever\ntook were bicarbonate of soda or aspirin.",
    "Hailey Preston shook his head and said That sure gives us a\nproblem.",
    "Yes it sure does.",
    "Where did Mr Rudd and Miss Gregg receive their guests\n\nRight here.",
    "Harley Preston went to the spot at the top of the stairs.",
    "ChiefInspector Craddock stood beside him.",
    "He looked at the wall\nopposite him.",
    "In the centre was an Italian Madonna and child.",
    "A\ngood copy he presumed of some wellknown picture.",
    "The bluerobed Madonna held aloft the infant Jesus and both child and\nmother were laughing.",
    "Little groups of people stood on either side\ntheir eyes upraised to the child.",
    "One of the more pleasing\nMadonnas Dermot Craddock thought.",
    "To the right and left of this\npicture were two narrow windows.",
    "The whole effect was very\ncharming but it seemed to him that there was emphatically nothing\nthere that would cause a woman to look like the Lady of Shalott\nwhose doom had come upon her.",
    "People of course were coming up the stairs he asked.",
    "Yes.",
    "They came in driblets you know.",
    "Not too many at once.",
    "I\nshepherded up some Ella Zielinsky thats Mr Rudds secretary\nbrought some of the others.",
    "We wanted to make it all pleasant and\ninformal.",
    "Were you here yourself at the time Mrs Badcock came up\n\nIm ashamed to tell you ChiefInspector Craddock that I just cant\nremember.",
    "I had a list of names I went out and I shepherded\npeople in.",
    "I introduced them saw to drinks then Id go out and\ncome up with the next batch.",
    "At the time I didnt know this Mrs\n\n\fBadcock by sight and she wasnt one of the ones on my list to bring\nup.",
    "What about a Mrs Bantry\n\nAh yes shes the former owner of this place isnt she I believe\nshe and Mrs Badcock and her husband did come up about the\nsame time.",
    "He paused.",
    "And the mayor came just about then.",
    "He\nhad a big chain on and a wife with yellow hair wearing royal blue\nwith frills.",
    "I remember all of them.",
    "I didnt pour drinks for any of\nthem because I had to go down and bring up the next lot.",
    "Who did pour drinks for them\n\nWhy I cant exactly say.",
    "There were three or four of us on duty.",
    "I\nknow I went down the stairs just as the mayor was coming up.",
    "Who else was on the stairs as you went down if you can\nremember\n\nJim Galbraith one of the newspaper boys who was covering this\nthree or four others whom I didnt know.",
    "There were a couple of\nphotographers one of the locals I dont remember his name and\nan arty girl from London who rather specialises in queer angle\nshots.",
    "Her camera was set right up in that corner so that she could\nget a view of Miss Gregg receiving.",
    "Ah now let me think I rather\nfancy that that was when Ardwyck Fenn arrived.",
    "And who is Ardwyck Fenn\n\n\fHailey Preston looked shocked.",
    "Hes a big shot ChiefInspector.",
    "A\nvery big shot in the Television and Moving Picture world.",
    "We didnt\neven know he was in this country.",
    "His turning up was a surprise\n\nIll say it was said Preston.",
    "Nice of him to come and quite\nunexpected.",
    "Was he an old friend of Miss Greggs and Mr Rudds\n\nHe was an old friend of Marinas a good many years ago when she\nwas married to her second husband.",
    "I dont know how well Jason\nknew him.",
    "Anyway it was a pleasant surprise when he arrived\n\nSure it was.",
    "We were all delighted.",
    "Craddock nodded and passed from that to other subjects.",
    "He made\nmeticulous inquiries about the drinks their ingredients how they\nwere served who served them what servants and hired servants\nwere on duty.",
    "The answers seemed to be as Inspector Cornish had\nalready hinted was the case that although any one of thirty people\ncould have poisoned Heather Badcock with the utmost ease yet at\nthe same time any one of the thirty might have been seen doing so\nIt was Craddock reflected a big chance to take.",
    "Thank you he said at last now I would like if I may to speak to\nMiss Marina Gregg.",
    "Hailey Preston shook his head.",
    "Im sorry he said.",
    "I really am sorry but thats right out of the\nquestion.",
    "Craddocks eyebrows rose.",
    "Surely\n\nShes prostrated.",
    "Shes absolutely prostrated.",
    "Shes got her own\nphysician here looking after her.",
    "He wrote out a certificate.",
    "Ive got\nit here.",
    "Ill show it to you.",
    "Craddock took it and read it.",
    "I see he said.",
    "He asked Does Marina Gregg always have a\nphysician in attendance\n\nTheyre very high strung all these actors and actresses.",
    "Its a big\nstrain this life.",
    "Its usually considered desirable in the case of the\nbig shots that they should have a physician who understands their\nconstitution and their nerves.",
    "Maurice Gilchrist has a very big\nreputation.",
    "Hes looked after Miss Gregg for many years now.",
    "Shes\nhad a great deal of illness as you may have read in the last four\nyears.",
    "She was hospitalized for a very long time.",
    "Its only about a\nyear ago that she got her strength and health back.",
    "I see.",
    "Hailey Preston seemed relieved that Craddock was not making any\nmore protests.",
    "Youll want to see Mr Rudd he suggested.",
    "Hell be  he looked at\nhis watch  hell be back from the studios in about ten minutes if\nthats all right for you.",
    "Thatll do admirably said Craddock.",
    "In the meantime is Dr\nGilchrist in the house\n\nHe is.",
    "Then Id like to talk to him.",
    "Why certainly.",
    "Ill fetch him right away.",
    "The young man bustled away.",
    "Dermot Craddock stood thoughtfully\nat the top of the stairs.",
    "Of course this frozen look that Mrs Bantry\nhad described might have been entirely Mrs Bantrys imagination.",
    "She was he thought a woman who would jump to conclusions.",
    "At\nthe same time he thought it quite likely that the conclusion to which\nshe had jumped was a just one.",
    "Without going so far as to look like\nthe Lady of Shalott seeing doom coming down upon her Marina\nGregg might have seen something that vexed or annoyed her.",
    "Something that had caused her to have been negligent to a guest to\nwhom she was talking.",
    "Somebody had come up those stairs\nperhaps who could be described as an unexpected guest  an\nunwelcome guest\n\n\fHe turned at the sound of footsteps.",
    "Harley Preston was back and\nwith him was Dr Maurice Gilchrist.",
    "Dr Gilchrist was not at all as\nDermot Craddock had imagined him.",
    "He had no suave bedside\nmanner neither was he theatrical in appearance.",
    "He seemed on\nthe face of it a blunt hearty matteroffact man.",
    "He was dressed in\ntweeds slightly florid tweeds to the English idea.",
    "He had a thatch of\nbrown hair and observant keen dark eyes.",
    "Doctor Gilchrist I am ChiefInspector Dermot Craddock.",
    "May I\nhave a word or two with you in private\n\nThe doctor nodded.",
    "He turned along the corridor and went along it\nalmost to the end then he pushed the door open and invited\nCraddock to enter.",
    "No one will disturb us here he said.",
    "It was obviously the doctors own bedroom a very comfortably\nappointed one.",
    "Dr Gilchrist indicated a chair and then sat down\nhimself.",
    "I understand said Craddock that Miss Marina Gregg according\nto you is unable to be interviewed.",
    "Whats the matter with her\nDoctor\n\nGilchrist shrugged his shoulders very slightly.",
    "Nerves he said.",
    "If you were to ask her questions now shed be in a\nstate bordering on hysteria within ten minutes.",
    "I cant permit that.",
    "If\nyou like to send your police doctor to see me Id be willing to give\n\n\fhim my views.",
    "She was unable to be present at the inquest for the\nsame reason.",
    "How long asked Craddock is such a state of things likely to\ncontinue\n\nDr Gilchrist looked at him and smiled.",
    "It was a likeable smile.",
    "If you want my opinion he said a human opinion that is not a\nmedical one any time within the next fortyeight hours and shell\nbe not only willing but asking to see you Shell be wanting to ask\nquestions.",
    "Shell be wanting to answer your questions.",
    "Theyre like\nthat He leaned forward.",
    "Id like to try and make you understand if I\ncan ChiefInspector a little bit what makes these people act the\nway they do.",
    "The motion picture life is a life of continuous strain\nand the more successful you are the greater the strain.",
    "You live\nalways all day in the public eye.",
    "When youre on location when\nyoure working its hard monotonous work with long hours.",
    "Youre\nthere in the morning you sit and you wait.",
    "You do your small bit the\nbit thats being shot over and over again.",
    "If youre rehearsing on the\nstage youd be rehearsing as likely as not a whole act or at any rate\na part of an act.",
    "The thing would be in sequence it would be more\nor less human and credible.",
    "But when youre shooting a picture\neverythings taken out of sequence.",
    "Its a monotonous grinding\nbusiness.",
    "Its exhausting.",
    "You live in luxury of course you have\nsoothing drugs you have baths and creams and powders and\nmedical attention you have relaxations and parties and people but\nyoure always in the public eye.",
    "You cant enjoy yourself quietly.",
    "You\ncant really  ever relax.",
    "I can understand that said Dermot.",
    "Yes I can understand.",
    "And theres another thing went on Gilchrist.",
    "If you adopt this\ncareer and especially if youre any good at it you are a certain kind\nof person.",
    "Youre a person  or so Ive found in my experience  with\na skin too few  a person who is plagued the whole time with\ndiffidence.",
    "A terrible feeling of inadequacy of apprehension that\nyou cant do whats required of you.",
    "People say that actors and\nactresses are vain.",
    "That isnt true.",
    "Theyre not conceited about\nthemselves theyre obsessed with themselves yes but they need\nreassurance the whole time.",
    "They must be continually reassured.",
    "Ask Jason Rudd.",
    "Hell tell you the same.",
    "You have to make them feel\nthey can do it to assure them they can do it take them over and\nover again over the same thing encouraging them the whole time\nuntil you get the effect you want.",
    "But they are always doubtful of\nthemselves.",
    "And that makes them in an ordinary human\nunprofessional word nervy.",
    "Damned nervy A mass of nerves.",
    "And\nthe worse their nerves are the better they are at the job.",
    "Thats interesting said Craddock.",
    "Very interesting.",
    "He paused\nadding Though I dont see quite why you \n\nIm trying to make you understand Marina Gregg said Maurice\nGilchrist.",
    "Youve seen her pictures no doubt.",
    "Shes a wonderful actress said Dermot wonderful.",
    "She has a\npersonality a beauty a sympathy.",
    "Yes said Gilchrist she has all those and shes had to work like\nthe devil to produce the effects that she has produced.",
    "In the\n\n\fprocess her nerves get shot to pieces and shes not actually a\nstrong woman physically.",
    "Not as strong as you need to be.",
    "Shes\ngot one of those temperaments that swing to and fro between\ndespair and rapture.",
    "She cant help it.",
    "Shes made that way.",
    "Shes\nsuffered a great deal in her life.",
    "A large part of the suffering has\nbeen her own fault but some of it hasnt.",
    "None of her marriages has\nbeen happy except Id say this last one.",
    "Shes married to a man\nnow who loves her dearly and whos loved her for years.",
    "Shes\nsheltering in that love and shes happy in it.",
    "At least at the moment\nshes happy in it.",
    "One cant say how long all that will last.",
    "The\ntrouble with her is that either she thinks that at last shes got to that\nspot or place or that moment in her life where everythings like a\nfairy tale come true that nothing can go wrong that shell never be\nunhappy again or else shes down in the dumps a woman whose\nlife is ruined whos never known love and happiness and who never\nwill again.",
    "He added dryly If she could only stop halfway between\nthe two itd be wonderful for her and the world would lose a fine\nactress.",
    "He paused but Dermot Craddock did not speak.",
    "He was wondering\nwhy Maurice Gilchrist was saying what he did.",
    "Why this close\ndetailed analysis of Marina Gregg Gilchrist was looking at him.",
    "It\nwas as though he was urging Dermot to ask one particular\nquestion.",
    "Dermot wondered very much what the question was that\nhe ought to ask.",
    "He said at last slowly with the air of one feeling his\nway\n\nShes been very much upset by this tragedy happening here\n\nYes said Gilchrist she has.",
    "Almost unnaturally so\n\nThat depends said Dr Gilchrist.",
    "On what does it depend\n\nOn her reason for being so upset.",
    "I suppose said Dermot feeling his way that it was a shock a\nsudden death happening like that in the midst of a party.",
    "He saw very little response in the face opposite him Or might it he\nsaid be something more than that\n\nYou cant tell of course said Dr Gilchrist how people are going to\nreact.",
    "You cant tell however well you know them.",
    "They can always\nsurprise you.",
    "Marina might have taken this in her stride.",
    "Shes a\nsofthearted creature.",
    "She might say Oh poor poor woman how\ntragic.",
    "I wonder how it could have happened.",
    "She could have been\nsympathetic without really caring.",
    "After all deaths do occasionally\noccur at studio parties.",
    "Or she might if there wasnt anything very\ninteresting going on choose  choose unconsciously mind you  to\ndramatize herself over it.",
    "She might decide to throw a scene.",
    "Or\nthere might be some quite different reason.",
    "Dermot decided to take the bull by the horns.",
    "I wish he said you\nwould tell me what you really think\n\n\fI dont know said Dr Gilchrist I cant be sure.",
    "He paused and\nthen said Theres professional etiquette you know.",
    "Theres the\nrelationship between doctor and patient.",
    "She has told you something\n\nI dont think I could go as far as that.",
    "Did Marina Gregg know this woman Heather Badcock Had she\nmet her before\n\nI dont think she knew her from Adam said Dr Gilchrist.",
    "No.",
    "Thats\nnot the trouble.",
    "If you ask me its nothing to do with Heather\nBadcock.",
    "Dermot said.",
    "This stuff this Calmo.",
    "Does Marina Gregg ever use it\nherself\n\nLives on it pretty well said Dr Gilchrist.",
    "So does everyone else\naround here he added.",
    "Ella Zielinsky takes it Harley Preston\ntakes it half the boiling takes it  its the fashion at this moment.",
    "Theyre all much the same these things.",
    "People get tired of one and\nthey try a new one that comes out and they think its wonderful and\nthat it makes all the difference.",
    "And does it make all the difference\n\nWell said Gilchrist it makes a difference.",
    "It does its work.",
    "It calms\nyou or it peps you up makes you feel you could do things which\notherwise you might fancy that you couldnt.",
    "I dont prescribe them\n\n\fmore than I can help but theyre not dangerous taken properly.",
    "They help people who cant help themselves.",
    "I wish I knew said Dermot Craddock what it is that you are trying\nto tell me.",
    "Im trying to decide said Gilchrist what is my duty.",
    "There are two\nduties.",
    "Theres the duty of a doctor to his patient.",
    "What his patient\nsays to him is confidential and must be kept so.",
    "But theres another\npoint of view.",
    "You can fancy that there is a danger to a patient.",
    "You\nhave to take steps to avoid that danger.",
    "He stopped.",
    "Craddock looked at him and waited.",
    "Yes said Dr Gilchrist.",
    "I think I know what I must do.",
    "l must ask\nyou ChiefInspector Craddock to keep what I am telling you\nconfidential.",
    "Not from your colleagues of course.",
    "But as far as\nregards the outer world particularly in the house here.",
    "Do you\nagree\n\nI cant bind myself said Craddock I dont know what will arise.",
    "In\ngeneral terms yes I agree.",
    "That is to say I imagine that any piece\nof information you gave me I should prefer to keep to myself and my\ncolleagues.",
    "Now listen said Gilchrist this maynt mean anything at all.",
    "Women\nsay anything when theyre in the state of nerves Marina Gregg is\nnow.",
    "Im telling you something which she said to me.",
    "There may be\nnothing in it at all.",
    "What did she say asked Craddock.",
    "She broke down after this thing happened.",
    "She sent for me.",
    "I gave\nher a sedative.",
    "I stayed there beside her holding her hand telling\nher to calm down telling her things were going to be all right.",
    "Then\njust before she went off into unconsciousness she said It was\nmeant for me Doctor.",
    "Craddock stared.",
    "She said that did she And afterwards the next\nday\n\nShe never alluded to it again.",
    "I raised the point once.",
    "She evaded it.",
    "She said Oh you must have made a mistake.",
    "Im sure I never said\nanything like that.",
    "I expect I was half doped at the time.",
    "But you think she meant it\n\nShe meant it all right said Gilchrist.",
    "Thats not to say that it is so\nhe added warningly.",
    "Whether someone meant to poison her or\nmeant to poison Heather Badcock I dont know.",
    "Youd probably\nknow better than I would.",
    "All I do say is that Marina Gregg definitely\nthought and believed that that dose was meant for her.",
    "Craddock was silent for some moments.",
    "Then he said Thank you\nDoctor Gilchrist.",
    "I appreciate what you have told me and I realise\nyour motive.",
    "If what Marina Gregg said to you was founded on fact\nit may mean may it not that there is still danger to her\n\nThats the point said Gilchrist.",
    "Thats the whole point.",
    "Have you any reason to believe that that might be so\n\nNo I havent.",
    "No idea what her reason for thinking so was\n\nNo.",
    "Thank you.",
    "Craddock got up.",
    "Just one thing more Doctor.",
    "Do you know if she\nsaid the same thing to her husband\n\nSlowly Gilchrist shook his head.",
    "No he said Im quite sure of that.",
    "She didnt tell her husband.",
    "His eyes met Dermots for a few moments then he gave a brief nod\nof his head and said You dont want me any more All right.",
    "Ill go\nback and have a look at the patient.",
    "You shall talk to her as soon as\nits possible.",
    "He left the room and Craddock remained pursing his lips up and\nwhistling very softly beneath his breath.",
    "Chapter 10\n\nJasons back now said Hailey Preston.",
    "Will you come with me\nChiefInspector Ill take you to his room.",
    "The room which Jason Rudd used partly for office and partly for a\nsittingroom was on the first floor.",
    "It was comfortably but not\nluxuriously furnished.",
    "It was a room which had little personality and\nno indication of the private tastes or predilection of its user.",
    "Jason\nRudd rose from the desk at which he was sitting and came forward\nto meet Dermot.",
    "It was wholly unnecessary Dermot thought for the\nroom to have a personality the user of it had so much.",
    "Hailey\nPreston had been an efficient and voluble gasbag.",
    "Gilchrist had\nforce and magnetism.",
    "But here was a man whom as Dermot\nimmediately admitted to himself it would not be easy to read.",
    "In the\ncourse of his career Craddock had met and summed up many\npeople.",
    "By now he was fully adept in realising the potentialities and\nvery often reading the thoughts of most of the people with whom he\ncame in contact.",
    "But he felt at once that one would be able to gauge\nonly as much of Jason Rudds thoughts as Jason Rudd himself\npermitted.",
    "The eyes deepset and thoughtful perceived but would\nnot easily reveal.",
    "The ugly rugged head spoke of an excellent\nintellect.",
    "The clowns face could repel you or attract you.",
    "Here\nthought Dermot Craddock to himself is where I sit and listen and\ntake very careful notes.",
    "Sorry ChiefInspector if youve had to wait for me.",
    "I was held up\nby some small complication over at the Studios.",
    "Can I offer you a\ndrink\n\nNot just now thank you Mr Rudd.",
    "The clowns face suddenly crinkled into a kind of ironic amusement.",
    "Not the house to take a drink in is that what youre thinking\n\nAs a matter of fact it wasnt what I was thinking.",
    "No no I suppose not.",
    "Well ChiefInspector what do you want to\nknow What can I tell you\n\nMr Preston has answered very adequately all the questions I have\nput to him.",
    "And that has been helpful to you\n\nNot as helpful as I could wish.",
    "Jason Rudd looked inquiring.",
    "Ive also seen Dr Gilchrist.",
    "He informs me that your wife is not yet\nstrong enough to be asked questions.",
    "Marina said Jason Rudd is very sensitive.",
    "Shes subject frankly\nto nervous storms.",
    "And murder at such close quarters is as you\nwill admit likely to produce a nerve storm.",
    "It is not a pleasant experience Dermot Craddock agreed dryly.",
    "In any ease I doubt if there is anything my wife could tell you that\nyou could not learn equally well from me.",
    "I was standing beside her\nwhen the thing happened and frankly I would say that I am a better\nobserver than my wife.",
    "The first question I would like to ask said Dermot and it is a\nquestion that you have probably answered already but for all that I\nwould like to ask again had you or your wife any previous\nacquaintance with Heather Badcock\n\nJason Rudd shook his head.",
    "None whatever.",
    "I certainly have never seen the woman before in\nmy life.",
    "I had two letters from her on behalf of the St John\nAmbulance Association but I had not met her personally until about\nfive minutes before her death.",
    "But she claimed to have met your wife\n\nJason Rudd nodded.",
    "Yes some twelve or thirteen years ago I gather.",
    "In Bermuda.",
    "Some big garden party in aid of ambulances which Marina opened\nfor them I think and Mrs Badcock as soon as she was introduced\nburst into some long rigmarole of how although she was in bed with\nflu she had got up and had managed to come to this affair and had\nasked for and got my wifes autograph.",
    "Again the ironical smile crinkled his face.",
    "That I may say is a very common occurrence ChiefInspector.",
    "Large mobs of people are usually lined up to obtain my wifes\nautograph and it is a moment that they treasure and remember.",
    "Quite understandably it is an event in their lives.",
    "Equally naturally it\nis not likely that my wife would remember one out of a thousand or\n\n\fso autograph hunters.",
    "She had quite frankly no recollection of\never having seen Mrs Badcock before.",
    "That I can well understand said Craddock.",
    "Now I have been told\nMr Rudd by an onlooker that your wife was slightly distraite during\nthe few moments that Heather Badcock was speaking to her.",
    "Would\nyou agree that such was the case\n\nVery possibly said Jason Rudd.",
    "Marina is not particularly strong.",
    "She was of course used to what I may describe as her public\nsocial work and could carry out her duties in that line almost\nautomatically.",
    "But towards the end of a long day she was inclined\noccasionally to flag.",
    "This may have been such a moment.",
    "I did not I\nmay say observe anything of the kind myself.",
    "No wait a minute\nthat is not quite true.",
    "I do remember that she was a little slow in\nmaking her reply to Mrs Badcock.",
    "In fact I think I nudged her very\ngently in the ribs.",
    "Something had perhaps distracted her attention said Dermot.",
    "Possibly but it may have been just a momentary lapse through\nfatigue.",
    "Dermot Craddock was silent for a few minutes.",
    "He looked out of the\nwindow where the view was the somewhat sombre one over the\nwoods surrounding Gossington Hall.",
    "He looked at the pictures on\nthe walls and finally he looked at Jason Rudd.",
    "Jason Rudds face\nwas attentive but nothing more.",
    "There was no guide to his feelings.",
    "He appeared courteous and completely at ease but he might\nCraddock thought be actually nothing of the kind.",
    "This was a man\n\n\fof very high mental calibre.",
    "One would not Dermot thought get\nanything out of him that he was not prepared to say unless one put\nones cards on the table.",
    "Dermot took his decision.",
    "He would do just\nthat.",
    "Has it occurred to you Mr Rudd that the poisoning of Heather\nBadcock may have been entirely accidental That the real intended\nvictim was your wife\n\nThere was a silence.",
    "Jason Rudds face did not change its\nexpression.",
    "Dermot waited.",
    "Finally Jason Rudd gave a deep sigh\nand appeared to relax.",
    "Yes he said quietly youre quite right ChiefInspector  I have\nbeen sure of it all along.",
    "But you have said nothing to that effect not to Inspector Cornish\nnot at the inquest\n\nNo.",
    "Why not Mr Rudd\n\nI could answer you very adequately by saying that it was merely a\nbelief on my part unsupported by any kind of evidence.",
    "The facts\nthat led me to deduce it were facts equally accessible to the law\nwhich was probably better qualified to decide than I was.",
    "I knew\nnothing about Mrs Badcock personally.",
    "She might have enemies\nsomeone might have decided to administer a fatal dose to her on\nthis particular occasion though it would seem a very curious and\n\n\ffarfetched decision.",
    "But it might have been chosen conceivably for\nthe reason that at a public occasion of this kind the issues would be\nmore confused the number of strangers present would be\nconsiderable and just for that reason it would be more difficult to\nbring home to the person in question the commission of such a\ncrime.",
    "All that is true but I am going to be frank with you ChiefInspector.",
    "That was not my reason for keeping silent.",
    "I will tell you\nwhat the reason was.",
    "I didnt want my wife to suspect for one\nmoment that it was she who had narrowly escaped dying by\npoison.",
    "Thank you for your frankness said Dermot.",
    "Not that I quite\nunderstand your motive in keeping silent.",
    "No Perhaps it is a little difficult to explain.",
    "You would have to know\nMarina to understand.",
    "She is a person who badly needs happiness\nand security.",
    "Her life has been highly successful in the material\nsense.",
    "She has won renown artistically but her personal life has\nbeen one of deep unhappiness.",
    "Again and again she has thought\nthat she has found happiness and was wildly and unduly elated\nthereby and has had her hopes dashed to the ground.",
    "She is\nincapable Mr Craddock of taking a rational prudent view of life.",
    "In\nher previous marriages she has expected like a child reading a\nfairy story to live happy ever afterwards.",
    "Again the ironic smile changed the ugliness of the clowns face into\na strange sudden sweetness.",
    "But marriage is not like that ChiefInspector.",
    "There can be no\nrapture continued indefinitely.",
    "We are fortunate indeed if we\n\n\fachieve a life of quiet content affection and serene and sober\nhappiness.",
    "He added.",
    "Perhaps you are married ChiefInspector\n\nDermot Craddock shook his head.",
    "I have not have that good or bad fortune he murmured.",
    "In our world the moving picture world marriage is a fully\noccupational hazard.",
    "Film stars marry often.",
    "Sometimes happily\nsometimes disastrously but seldom permanently.",
    "In that respect I\nshould not say that Marina has had any undue cause to complain\nbut to one of her temperament things of that kind matter very\ndeeply.",
    "She imbued herself with the idea that she was unlucky that\nnothing would ever go right for her.",
    "She has always been looking\ndesperately for the same things love happiness affection\nsecurity.",
    "She was wildly anxious to have children.",
    "According to\nsome medical opinion the very strength of that anxiety frustrated\nits object.",
    "One very celebrated physician advised the adoption of a\nchild.",
    "He said it is often the case that when an intense desire for\nmaternity is assuaged by having adopted a baby a child is born\nnaturally shortly afterwards.",
    "Marina adopted no less than three\nchildren.",
    "For a time she got a certain amount of happiness and\nserenity but it was not the real thing.",
    "You can imagine her delight\nwhen eleven years ago she found she was going to have a child.",
    "Her pleasure and delight were quite indescribable.",
    "She was in good\nhealth and the doctors assured her that there was every reason to\nbelieve that everything would go well.",
    "As you may or may not know\nthe result was tragedy.",
    "The child a boy was born mentally\ndeficient imbecile.",
    "The result was disastrous.",
    "Marina had a\ncomplete breakdown and was severely ill for years confined to a\n\n\fsanatorium.",
    "Though her recovery was slow she did recover.",
    "Shortly\nafter that we married and she began once more to take an interest\nin life and to feel that perhaps she could be happy.",
    "It was difficult at\nfirst for her to get a worthwhile contract for a picture.",
    "Everyone\nwas inclined to doubt whether her health would stand the strain.",
    "I\nhad to baffle for that.",
    "Jason Rudds lips set firmly together.",
    "Well\nthe baffle was successful.",
    "We have started shooting the picture.",
    "In\nthe meantime we bought this house and set about altering it.",
    "Only\nabout a fortnight ago Marina was saying to me how happy she was\nand how she felt at last she was going to be able to settle down to a\nhappy home life her troubles behind her.",
    "I was a little nervous\nbecause as usual her expectations were too optimistic.",
    "But there\nwas no doubt that she was happy.",
    "Her nervous symptoms\ndisappeared there was a calmness and a quietness about her that I\nhad never seen before.",
    "Everything was going well until he paused.",
    "His voice became suddenly bitter.",
    "Until this happened That\nwoman had to die  here That in itself was shock enough.",
    "I couldnt\nrisk  I was determined not to risk  Marinas knowing that an\nattempt had been made on her life.",
    "That would have been a second\nperhaps fatal shock.",
    "It might have precipitated another mental\ncollapse.",
    "He looked directly at Dermot.",
    "Do you understand  now\n\nI see your point of view said Craddock but forgive me isnt there\none aspect that you are neglecting You give me your conviction\nthat an attempt was made to poison your wife.",
    "Doesnt that danger\n\n\fstill remain If a poisoner does not succeed isnt it likely that the\nattempt may be repeated\n\nNaturally Ive considered that said Jason Rudd but I am\nconfident that being forewarned so to speak I can take all\nreasonable precautions for my wifes safety.",
    "I shall watch over her\nand arrange that others shall watch over her.",
    "The great thing I feel\nis that she herself should not know that any danger threatened her.",
    "And you think said Dermot cautiously that she does not know\n\nOf course not.",
    "She has no idea.",
    "Youre sure of that\n\nCertain.",
    "Such an idea would never occur to her.",
    "But it occurred to you Dermot pointed out.",
    "Thats very different said Jason Rudd.",
    "Logically it was the only\nsolution.",
    "But my wife isnt logical and to begin with she could not\npossibly imagine that anyone would want to do away with her.",
    "Such\na possibility would simply not occur to her mind.",
    "You may be right said Dermot slowly but that leaves us now with\nseveral other questions.",
    "Again let me put this bluntly.",
    "Whom do you\nsuspect\n\nI cant tell you.",
    "Excuse me Mr Rudd do you mean by that you cant or that you\nwont\n\nJason Rudd spoke quickly.",
    "Cant.",
    "Cant every time.",
    "It seems to me\njust as impossible as it would seem to her that anyone would dislike\nher enough  should have a suficient grudge against her  to do\nsuch a thing.",
    "On the other hand on the sheer downright evidence\nof the facts that is exactly what must have occurred.",
    "Will you outline the facts to me as you see them\n\nIf you like.",
    "The circumstances are quite clear.",
    "I poured out two\ndaiquiri cocktails from an already prepared jug.",
    "I took them to\nMarina and Mrs Badcock.",
    "What Mrs Badcock did I do not know.",
    "She\nmoved on I presume to speak to someone she knew.",
    "My wife had\nher drink in her hand.",
    "At that moment the mayor and his wife were\napproaching.",
    "She put down her glass as yet untouched and\ngreeted them.",
    "Then there were more greetings.",
    "An old friend wed\nnot seen for years some other locals and one or two people from\nthe studios.",
    "During that time the glass containing the cocktail stood\non the table which was situated at that time behind us since we had\nboth moved forward a little to the top of the stairs.",
    "One or two\nphotographs were taken of my wife talking to the mayor which we\nhoped would please the local population at the special request of\nthe representatives of the local newspaper.",
    "While this was being\ndone I brought some fresh drinks to a few of the last arrivals.",
    "During that time my wifes glass must have been poisoned.",
    "Dont\nask me how it was done it cannot have been easy to do.",
    "On the\nother hand it is startling if anyone has the nerve to do an action\nopenly and unconcernedly how little people are likely to notice it\n\n\fYou ask me if I have suspicions all I can say is that at least one of\nabout twenty people might have done it.",
    "People you see were\nmoving about in little groups talking occasionally going off to have\na look at the alterations which had been done to the house.",
    "There\nwas movement continual movement.",
    "Ive thought and Ive thought\nIve racked my brains but there is nothing absolutely nothing to\ndirect my suspicions to any particular person.",
    "He paused and gave an exasperated sigh.",
    "I understand said Dermot.",
    "Go on please.",
    "I dare say youve heard the next part before.",
    "I should like to hear it again from you.",
    "Well I had come back towards the head of the stairs.",
    "My wife had\nturned towards the table and was just picking up her glass.",
    "There\nwas a slight exclamation from Mrs Badcock.",
    "Somebody must have\njogged her arm and the glass slipped out of her fingers and was\nbroken on the floor.",
    "Marina did the natural hostesss act.",
    "Her own\nskirt had been slightly touched with the liquid.",
    "She insisted no harm\nwas done used her own handkerchief to wipe Mrs Badcocks skirt\nand insisted on her having her own drink.",
    "If I remember she said\nIve had far too much already.",
    "So that was that.",
    "But I can assure\nyou of this.",
    "The fatal dose could not have been added after that for\nMrs Badcock immediately began to drink from the glass.",
    "As you\nknow four or five minutes later she was dead.",
    "I wonder  how I\nwonder  what the poisoner must have felt when he realised how\nbadly his scheme had failed...\n\n\fAll this occurred to you at the time\n\nOf course not.",
    "At the time I concluded naturally enough this\nwoman had had some kind of a seizure.",
    "Perhaps heart coronary\nthrombosis something of that sort.",
    "It never occurred to me that\npoisoning was involved.",
    "Would it occur to you  would it occur to\nanybody\n\nProbably not said Dermot.",
    "Well your account is clear enough and\nyou seem sure of your facts.",
    "You say you have suspicion of any\nparticular person.",
    "I cant quite accept that you know.",
    "I assure you its the truth.",
    "Let us approach it from another angle.",
    "Who is there who could\nwish to harm your wife It all sounds melodramatic if you put it this\nway but what enemies had she got Jason Rudd made an\nexpressive gesture.",
    "Enemies Enemies Its so hard to define what one means by an\nenemy.",
    "Theres plenty of envy and jealousy in the world my wife and\nI occupy.",
    "There are always people who say malicious things wholl\nstart a whispering campaign who will do someone they are jealous\nof a bad turn if the opportunity occurs.",
    "But that doesnt mean that\nany of those people is a murderer or indeed even a likely murderer.",
    "Dont you agree\n\n\fYes I agree.",
    "There must be something beyond petty dislikes or\nenvies.",
    "Is there anyone whom your wife has injured say in the\npast\n\nJason Rudd did not rebut this easily.",
    "Instead he frowned.",
    "Honestly I dont think so he said at last and I may say Ive given a\nlot of thought to that point.",
    "Anything in the nature of a love affair an association with some\nman\n\nThere have of course been affairs of that kind.",
    "It may be\nconsidered I suppose that Marina has occasionally treated some\nman badly.",
    "But there is nothing to cause any lasting illwill.",
    "Im sure\nof it.",
    "What about women Any woman who has had a lasting grudge\nagainst Miss Gregg\n\nWell said Jason Rudd you can never tell with women.",
    "I cant think\nof any particular one offhand.",
    "Whod benefit financially by your wifes death\n\nHer will benefits various people but not to any large extent.",
    "I\nsuppose the people whod benefit as you put it financially would\nbe myself as her husband and from another angle possibly the\nstar who might replace her in this film.",
    "Though of course the film\nmight be abandoned altogether.",
    "These things are very uncertain.",
    "Well we need not go into all that now said Dermot.",
    "And I have your assurance that Marina will not be told that she is in\npossible danger\n\nWe shall have to go into that matter said Dermot.",
    "I want to\nimpress upon you that you are taking quite a considerable risk\nthere.",
    "However the matter will not arise for some days since your\nwife is still under medical care.",
    "Now there is one more thing I would\nlike you to do.",
    "I would like you to write down for me as accurately as\nyou can every single person who was in that recess at the top of the\nstairs or whom you saw coming up the stairs at the time of the\nmurder.",
    "Ill do my best but Im rather doubtful.",
    "Youd do far better to\nconsult my secretary Ella Zielinsky.",
    "She has a most accurate\nmemory and also lists of the local lads who were there.",
    "If youd like\nto see her now \n\nI would like to talk to Miss Ella Zielinsky very much said Dermot.",
    "Chapter 11\n\nSurveying Dermot Craddock unemotionally through her large hornrimmed spectacles Ella Zielinsky seemed to him almost too good to\nbe true.",
    "With quiet businesslike alacrity she whipped out of a\ndrawer a typewritten sheet and passed it across to him.",
    "I think I can be fairly sure that there are no omissions she said.",
    "But it is just possible that I may have included one or two names local names they will be  who were not actually there.",
    "That is to say\nwho may have left earlier or who may not have been found and\nbrought up.",
    "Actually Im pretty sure that it is correct.",
    "A very efficient piece of work if I may say so said Dermot.",
    "Thank you.",
    "I suppose  I am quite an ignoramus in such things  that you have\nto attain a high standard of efficiency in your job\n\nOne has to have things pretty well taped yes.",
    "What else does your job comprise Are you a kind of liaison officer\nso to speak between the studios and Gossington Hall\n\nNo.",
    "Ive nothing to do with the studios actually though of course I\nnaturally take messages from there on the telephone or send them.",
    "My job is to look after Miss Greggs social life her public and\nprivate engagements and to supervise in some degree the running\nof the house.",
    "You like the job\n\nIts extremely well paid and I find it reasonably interesting.",
    "I didnt\nhowever bargain for murder she added dryly.",
    "Did it seem very incredible to you\n\nSo much so that I am going to ask you if you are really sure it is\nmurder\n\nSix times the dose of diethylmexine etc.",
    "etc.",
    "could hardly be\nanything else.",
    "It might have been an accident of some kind.",
    "And how would you suggest such an accident could have\noccurred\n\nMore easily than youd imagine since you dont know the setup.",
    "This house is simply full of drugs of all kinds.",
    "I dont mean dope\nwhen I say drugs.",
    "I mean properly prescribed remedies but like\nmost of these things what they call I understand the lethal dose is\nnot very far removed from the therapeutic dose.",
    "Dermot nodded.",
    "These theatrical and picture people have the most curious lapses\nin their intelligence.",
    "Sometimes it seems to me that the more of an\nartistic genius you are the less common sense you have in everday\nlife.",
    "That may well be.",
    "What with all the bottles cachets powders capsules and little\nboxes that they carry about with them what with popping in a\n\n\ftranquilliser here and a tonic there and a pep pill somewhere else\ndont you think it would be easy enough that the whole thing might\nget mixed up\n\nI dont see how it could apply in this case.",
    "Well I think it could.",
    "Somebody one of the guests may have\nwanted a sedative or a reviver and whipped out his or her little\ncontainer which they carry around and possibly because they\nhadnt remembered the dose because they hadnt had one for some\ntime might have put too much in a glass.",
    "Then their mind was\ndistracted and they went off somewhere and lets say this Mrs\nWhatshername comes along thinks its her glass picks it up and\ndrinks it.",
    "Thats surely a more feasible idea than anything else\n\nYou dont think that all those possibilities havent been gone into\ndo you\n\nNo I suppose not.",
    "But there were a lot of people there and a lot of\nglasses standing about with drinks in them.",
    "It happens often\nenough you know that you pick up the wrong glass and drink out\nof it.",
    "Then you dont think that Heather Badcock was deliberately\npoisoned You think that she drank out of somebody elses glass\n\nI cant imagine anything more likely to happen.",
    "In that case said Dermot speaking carefully it would have had to\nbe Marina Greggs glass.",
    "You realise that Marina handed her her\nown glass.",
    "Or what she thought was her own glass Ella Zielinsky corrected\nhim.",
    "You havent talked to Marina yet have you shes extremely\nvague.",
    "Shed pick up any glass that looked as though it were hers\nand drink it.",
    "Ive seen her do it again and again.",
    "She takes Calmo\n\nOh yes we all do.",
    "You too Miss Zielinsky\n\nIm driven to it sometimes said Ella Zielinsky.",
    "These things are\nrather imitative you know.",
    "I shall be glad said Dermot when I am able to talk to Miss Gregg.",
    "She  er  seems to be prostrated for a very long time.",
    "Thats just throwing a temperament said Ella Zielinksy.",
    "She just\ndramatizes herself a good deal you know.",
    "Shed never take murder\nin her stride.",
    "As you manage to do Miss Zielinsky\n\nWhen everybody about you is in a continual state of agitation said\nElla dryly it develops in you a desire to go to the opposite extreme.",
    "You learn to take a pride in not turning a hair when some shocking\ntragedy occurs\n\nShe considered.",
    "Its not a really nice trait perhaps.",
    "But I think if\nyou didnt develop that sense youd probably go round the bend\nyourself.",
    "Was Miss Gregg  is Miss Gregg a difficult person to work for\n\nIt was something of a personal question but Dermot Craddock\nregarded it as a kind of test.",
    "If Ella Zielinsky raised her eyebrows\nand tacitly demanded what this had to do with the murder of Mrs\nBadcock he would be forced to admit that it had nothing to do with\nit.",
    "But he wondered if Ella Zielinsky might perhaps enjoy telling him\nwhat she thought of Marina Gregg.",
    "Shes a great artist.",
    "Shes got a personal magnetism that comes\nover on the screen in the most extraordinary way.",
    "Because of that\none feels its rather a privilege to work with her.",
    "Taken purely\npersonally of course shes hell\n\nAh said Dermot.",
    "Shes no kind of moderation you see.",
    "Shes up in the air or down in\nthe dumps and everything is always terrifically exaggerated and\nshe changes her mind and there are an enormous lot of things that\none must never mention or allude\n\nto because they upset her.",
    "Such as\n\nWell naturally mental breakdown or sanatoriums for mental\ncases.",
    "I think it is quite to be understood that she should be\nsensitive about that.",
    "And anything to do with children.",
    "Children In what way\n\nWell it upsets her to see children or to hear of people being happy\nwith children.",
    "If she hears someone is going to have a baby or has\njust had a baby it throws her into a state of misery at once.",
    "She can\nnever have another child herself you see and the only one she did\nhave is batty.",
    "I dont know if you knew that\n\nI had heard it yes.",
    "Its all very sad and unfortunate.",
    "But after a\ngood many years youd think shed forget about it a little.",
    "She doesnt.",
    "Its an obsession with her.",
    "She broods on it.",
    "What does Mr Rudd feel about it\n\nOh it wasnt his child.",
    "It was her last husbands Isidore Wrights.",
    "Ah yes her last husband.",
    "Where is he now\n\nHe married again and lives in Florida said Ella Zielinsky promptly.",
    "Would you say that Marina Gregg had made many enemies in her\nlife\n\n\fNot unduly so.",
    "Not more than most that is to say.",
    "There are always\nrows over other women or other men or over contacts or jealousy all of those things.",
    "She wasnt as far as you know afraid of anyone\n\nMarina Afraid of anyone I dont think so.",
    "Why Should she be\n\nI dont know said Dermot.",
    "He picked up the list of names.",
    "Thank\nyou very much Miss Zielinsky.",
    "If theres anything else I want to\nknow Ill come back.",
    "May I\n\nCertainly.",
    "Im only too anxious  were all only too anxious  to do\nanything we can to help.",
    "II\n\nWell Tom what have you got for me\n\nDetectiveSergeant Tiddler grinned appreciatively.",
    "His name was\nnot Tom it was William but the combination of Tom Tiddler had\nalways been too much for his colleagues.",
    "What gold and silver have you picked up for me continued Dermot\nCraddock.",
    "The two were staying at the Blue Boar and Tiddler had just come\nback from a day spent at the studios.",
    "The proportion of gold is very small said Tiddler.",
    "Not much\ngossip.",
    "No startling rumours.",

    "Marina Gregg is convinced that that\nlethal dose was meant for her.",
    "Is she now Is she right\n\nAlmost certainly I should say Dermot replied.",
    "But thats not the\npoint.",
    "The point is that she hasnt told her husband so only her\ndoctor.",

    "Im not often shocked\nyou know but this does shock me a little.",
    "What the private lives of film stars\n\nOh no said Miss Marple not that That all seems to be most\nnatural given the circumstances and the money involved and the\nopportunities for propinquity.",
    "Oh no thats natural enough.",
    "I mean\nthe way theyre written about.",
    "Im rather oldfashioned you know\nand I feel that that really shouldnt be allowed.",
    "Its news said Dermot Craddock and some pretty nasty things\ncan be said in the way of fair comment.",
    "I know said Miss Marple.",
    "It makes me sometimes very angry.",
    "I\nexpect you think its silly of me reading all these.",
    "But one does so\nbadly want to be in things and of course sitting here in the house I\ncant really know as much about things as I would like to.",
    "Thats just what I thought said Dermot Craddock and thats why\nIve come to tell you about them.",
    "But my dear boy excuse me would your superiors really approve\nof that\n\nI dont see why not said Dermot.",
    "Here he added I have a list.",
    "A\nlist of people who were there on that landing during the short time\nof Heather Badcocks arrival until her death.",
    "Weve eliminated a lot\nof people perhaps precipitately but I dont think so.",
    "Weve\neliminated the mayor and his wife and Alderman somebody and his\nwife and a great many of the locals though weve kept in the\nhusband.",
    "If I remember rightly you were always very suspicious of\nhusbands.",
    "They are often the obvious suspects\n\nsaid Miss Marple\n\napologetically and the obvious is so often right.",
    "I couldnt agree with you more said Craddock.",
    "But which husband my dear boy are you referring to\n\nWhich one do you think asked Dermot.",
    "He eyed her sharply.",
    "Miss Marple looked at him.",
    "Jason Rudd she asked.",
    "Ah said Craddock.",
    "Your mind works just as mine does.",
    "I dont\nthink it was Arthur Badcock because you see I dont think that\nHeather Badcock was meant to be killed.",
    "I think the intended victim\nwas Marina Gregg.",
    "That would seem almost certain wouldnt it said Miss Marple.",
    "And so said Craddock as we both agree on that the field widens.",
    "To tell you who was there on that day what they saw or said they\nsaw and where they were or said they were is only a thing you\ncould have observed for yourself if youd been there.",
    "So my\nsuperiors as you call them couldnt possibly object to my\ndiscussing that with you could they\n\nThats very nicely put my dear boy said Miss Marple.",
    "Ill give you a little pr\u0439cis of what I was told mad then well come to\nthe list.",
    "He gave a brief r\u0439sum\u0439 of what he had heard and then he produced\nhis list.",
    "It must be one of these he said.",
    "My godfather Sir Henry\nClithering told me that you once had a club here.",
    "You called it the\nTuesday Night Club.",
    "You all dined with each other in turn and then\nsomeone would tell a story  a story of some real life happening\nwhich had ended in mystery.",
    "A mystery of which only the teller of\nthe tale knew the answer.",
    "And every time so my godfather told me\nyou guessed right.",
    "So I thought Id come along and see if youd do a\nbit of guessing for me this morning.",
    "I think that is rather a frivolous way of putting it said Miss Marple\nreproving but there is one question I should like to ask.",
    "Yes\n\n\fWhat about the children\n\nThe children Theres only one.",
    "An imbecile child in a sanatorium\nin America.",
    "Is that what you mean\n\nNo said Miss Marple thats not what I mean.",
    "Its very sad of\ncourse.",
    "One of those tragedies that seem to happen and theres no\none to blame for it.",
    "No I meant the children that Ive seen\nmentioned in some article here.",
    "She tapped the papers in front of\nher.",
    "Children that Marina Gregg adopted.",
    "Two boys I think and a\ngirl.",
    "In one case a mother with a lot of children and very little money\nto bring them up in this country wrote to her and asked if she\ncouldnt take a child.",
    "There was a lot of very silly false sentiment\nwritten about that.",
    "About the mothers unselfishness and the\nwonderful home and education and future the child was going to\nhave.",
    "I cant find out much about the other two.",
    "One I think was a\nforeign refugee and the other was some American child.",
    "Marina\nGregg adopted them at different times.",
    "Id like to know whats\nhappened to them.",
    "Dermot Craddock looked at her curiously.",
    "Its odd that you should\nthink of that he said.",
    "I did just vaguely wonder about those\nchildren myself.",
    "But how do you connect them up\n\nWell said Miss Marple as far as I can hear or find out theyre not\nliving with her now are they\n\n\fI expect they were provided for said Craddock.",
    "In fact I think that\nthe adoption laws would insist on that.",
    "There was probably money\nsettled on them in trust.",
    "So when she got  tired of them said Miss Marple with a very faint\npause before the word tired they were dismissed After being\nbrought up in luxury with every advantage.",
    "Is that it\n\nProbably said Craddock.",
    "I dont know exactly.",
    "He continued to\nlook at her curiously.",
    "Children feel things you know said Miss Marple nodding her\nhead.",
    "They feel things more than the people around them ever\nimagine.",
    "The sense of hurt of being rejected of not belonging.",
    "Its\na thing that you dont get over just because of advantages.",
    "Education is no substitute for it or comfortable living or an\nassured income or a start in a profession.",
    "Its the sort of thing that\nmight rankle.",
    "Yes.",
    "But all the same isnt it rather farfetched to think that  Well\nwhat exactly do you think\n\nI havent got as far as that said Miss Marple.",
    "I just wondered\nwhere they were now and how old they would be now Grown up I\nshould imagine from what Ive read here.",
    "I could find out I suppose said Dermot Craddock slowly.",
    "Oh I dont want to bother you in any way or even to suggest that\nmy little ideas worthwhile at all.",
    "Theres no harm said Dermot Craddock in having that checked\nup on.",
    "He made a note in his little book.",
    "Now do you want to look at\nmy little list\n\nI dont really think I should be able to do anything useful about that.",
    "You see I wouldnt know who the people were.",
    "Oh I could give you a running commentary said Craddock.",
    "Here\nwe\n\nare.",
    "Jason\n\nRudd\n\nhusband\n\nhusbands\n\nalways\n\nhighly\n\nsuspicious.",
    "Everyone says that Jason Rudd adores her.",
    "That is\nsuspicious in itself dont you think\n\nNot necessarily said Miss Marple with dignity.",
    "Hes been very active in trying to conceal the fact that his wife was\nthe object of attack.",
    "He hasnt hinted any suspicion of such a thing\nto the police.",
    "I dont know why he thinks were such asses as not to\nthink of it for ourselves.",
    "Weve considered it from the first.",
    "But\nanyway thats his story.",
    "He was afraid that knowledge of that fact\nmight get to his wifes ears and that shed go into a panic about it.",
    "Is she the sort of woman who goes into panics\n\nYes shes neurasthenic throws temperaments has nervous\nbreakdowns gets in states.",
    "That might not mean any lack of courage Miss Marple objected.",
    "On the other hand said Craddock if he knows quite well that she\nwas the object of attack its also possible that she may know who\ndid it.",
    "You mean she knows who did it  but does not want to disclose the\nfact\n\nI just say its a possibility and if so one rather wonders why not It\nlooks as though the motive the root of the matter was something\nshe didnt want to come to her husbands ear.",
    "That is certainly an interesting thought said Miss Marple.",
    "Here are a few more names.",
    "The secretary Ella Zielinsky.",
    "An\nextremely competent and efficient young woman.",
    "In love with the husband do you think asked Miss Marple.",
    "I should think definitely answered Craddock but why should you\nthink so\n\nWell it so often happens said Miss Marple.",
    "And therefore not very\nfond of poor Marina Gregg I expect\n\nTherefore possible motive for murder said Craddock.",
    "A lot of secretaries and employees are in love with their employers\nhusbands said Miss Marple but very very few of them try to\npoison them.",
    "Well we must allow for exceptions said Craddock.",
    "Then there\nwere two local and one London photographer and two members of\nthe Press.",
    "None of them seems likely but we will follow them up.",
    "There was the woman who was formerly married to Marina Greggs\nsecond or third husband.",
    "She didnt like it when Marina Gregg took\nher husband away.",
    "Still thats about eleven or twelve years ago.",
    "It\nseems unlikely that shed make a visit here at this juncture on\npurpose to poison Marina because of that.",
    "Then theres a man\ncalled Ardwyck Fenn.",
    "He was once a very close friend of Marina\nGreggs.",
    "He hasnt seen her for years.",
    "He was not known to be in\nthis part of the world and it was a great surprise when he turned up\non this occasion.",
    "She would be startled then when she saw him\n\nPresumably yes.",
    "Startled  and possibly frightened.",
    "The doom has come upon me said Craddock.",
    "Thats the idea.",
    "Then there was young Hailey Preston dodging about that day doing\nhis stuff.",
    "Talks a good deal but definitely heard nothing saw\nnothing and knew nothing.",
    "Almost too anxious to say so.",
    "Does\nanything there ring a bell\n\nNot exactly said Miss Marple.",
    "Plenty of interesting possibilities.",
    "But Id still like to know a little more about the children.",
    "He looked at her curiously.",
    "Youve got quite a bee in your bonnet\nabout that havent you he said.",
    "All right Ill find out.",
    "Chapter 13\n\nI suppose it couldnt possibly have been the mayor said Inspector\nCornish wistfully.",
    "He tapped the paper with the list of names on it with his pencil.",
    "Dermot Craddock grinned.",
    "Wishful thinking he asked.",
    "You could certainly call it that said Cornish.",
    "Pompous canting old\nhypocrite he went on.",
    "Everybodys got it in for him.",
    "Throws his\nweight about ultra sanctimonious and neck deep in graft for years\npast\n\nCant you ever bring it home to him\n\nNo said Cornish.",
    "Hes too slick for that.",
    "Hes always just on the\nright side of the law.",
    "Its tempting I agree said Dermot Craddock but I think youll\nhave to banish that rosy picture from your mind Frank.",
    "I know I know said Cornish.",
    "Hes a possible but a wildly\nimprobable.",
    "Who else have we got\n\nBoth men studied the list again.",
    "There were still eight names on it.",
    "Were pretty well agreed said Craddock that theres nobody\nmissed out from here There was a faint question in his voice.",

    "There you are.",
    "In addition there was an arty\nphotographer from London with a camera set up on the angle of the\nstairs.",
    "If as you suggest this Mrs Bantrys story of Marina Gregg\nhaving a frozen look was occasioned by someone she saw on the\nstairs youve got to take your pick among that lot.",
    "Mayor regretfully\nout.",
    "Grices out  never been away from St Mary Mead I should say.",
    "That leaves four.",
    "Local journalist unlikely photographer girl had\nbeen there for half an hour already so why should Marina react so\nlate in the day What does that leave\n\nSinister strangers from America said Craddock with a faint smile.",
    "Youve said it.",
    "Theyre our best suspects by far I agree said Craddock.",
    "They\nturned up unexpectedly.",
    "Ardwyck Fenn was an old flame of\nMarinas whom she had not seen for years.",

    "Would you Frank After a lapse of about fifteen years or so and\nhaving remarried twice herself since then\n\nCornish said that you never knew with women.",
    "Dermot accepted\nthat as a general dictum but remarked that it seemed odd to him to\nsay the least of it.",
    "But you agree that it lies between them\n\nPossibly.",

    "Difficulties\n\nOf putting poison into Marinas glass without anybody seeing her.",
    "Well thats the same for everybody isnt it It was a mad thing to\ndo.",

    "Everyone would be looking at her.",
    "True enough Cornish admitted.",
    "The locals would nudge each other and whisper and stare and\nafter Marina Gregg and Jason Rudd greeted her shed have been\npassed on for the secretaries to look after.",
    "It wouldnt be easy\nFrank.",
    "However adroit you were you couldnt be sure someone\nwouldnt see you.",
    "Thats the snag there and its a big snag.",
    "As I say isnt that snag the same for everybody\n\nNo said Craddock.",
    "Oh no.",
    "Far from it.",
    "Take the butler now\nGiuseppe.",
    "Hes busy with the drinks and glasses with pouring\n\n\fthings out with handing them.",
    "He could put a pinch or a tablet or\ntwo of Calmo in a glass easily enough.",
    "Giuseppe Frank Cornish reflected.",
    "Do you think he did\n\nNo reason to believe so said Craddock but we might find a\nreason.",
    "A nice solid bit of motive that is to say.",
    "Yes he could have\ndone it.",
    "Or one of the catering staff could have done it unfortunately\nthey werent on the spot  a pity.",
    "Someone\n\nmight\n\nhave\n\nmanaged\n\nto\n\nget\n\nhimself or\n\nherself\n\ndeliberately planted in the firm for the purpose.",
    "You mean it might have been as premeditated as all that\n\nWe dont know anything about it yet said Craddock vexedly.",
    "We\nabsolutely dont know the first thing about it.",
    "Not until we can prise\nwhat we want to know out of Marina Gregg or out of her husband.",
    "They must know or suspect  but theyre not telling.",
    "And we dont\nknow yet why theyre not telling.",
    "Weve a long way to go.",
    "He paused and then resumed Discounting the frozen look which\nmay have been pure coincidence there are other people who could\nhave done it fairly easily.",
    "The secretary woman Ella Zielinsky.",
    "She\nwas also busy with glasses with handing things to people.",
    "Nobody\nwould be watching her with any particular interest.",
    "The same\napplies to that willow wand of a young man  Ive forgotten his\nname.",
    "Hailey  Hailey Preston Thats right.",
    "There would have been\na good opportunity for either of them.",
    "In fact if either of them had\n\n\fwanted to do away with Marina Gregg it would have been far safer\nto do so on a public occasion.",
    "Anyone else\n\nWell theres always the husband said Craddock.",
    "Back to the husbands again said Cornish with a faint smile.",
    "We\nthought it was that poor devil Badcock before we realised that\nMarina was the intended victim.",
    "Now weve transferred our\nsuspicions to Jason Rudd.",
    "He seems devoted enough though I\nmust say.",
    "He has the reputation of being so said Craddock but one never\nknows.",
    "If he wanted to get rid of her wouldnt divorce be much easier\n\nIt would be far more usual agreed Dermot but there may be a lot\nof ins and outs to this business that we dont know yet.",
    "The telephone rang.",
    "Cornish took up the receiver.",
    "What Yes Put them through.",
    "Yes hes here.",
    "He listened for a\nmoment then put his hand over the receiver and looked at Dermot.",
    "Miss Marina Gregg he said is feeling very much better.",
    "She is\nquite ready to be interviewed.",
    "Id better hurry along said Dermot Craddock before she changes\nher mind.",
    "II\n\nAt Gossington Hall Dermot Craddock was received by Ella\nZielinsky.",
    "She was as usual brisk and efficient.",
    "Miss Gregg is waiting for you Mr Craddock she said.",
    "Dermot looked at her with some interest.",
    "From the beginning he\nhad found Ella Zielinsky an intriguing personality.",
    "He had said to\nhimselfA poker face if I ever saw one.",
    "She had answered any\nquestions he had asked with the utmost readiness.",
    "She had shown\nno signs of keeping anything back but what she really thought or\nfelt or even knew about the business he still had no idea.",
    "There\nseemed to be no chink in the armour of her bright efficiency.",
    "She\nmight know more than she said she did she might know a good\ndeal.",
    "The only thing he was sure of  and he had to admit to himself\nthat he had no reasons to adduce for that surety  was that she was\nin love with Jason Rudd.",
    "It was as he had said an occupational\ndisease of secretaries.",
    "It probably meant nothing.",
    "But the fact did\nat least suggest a motive and he was sure quite sure that she was\nconcealing something.",
    "It might be love it might be hate.",
    "It might\nquite simply be guilt.",
    "She might have taken her opportunity that\nafternoon or she might have deliberately planned what she was\ngoing to do.",
    "He could see her in the part quite easily as far as the\nexecution of it went.",
    "Her swift but unhurried movements moving\nhere and there looking after guests handing glasses to one or\nanother taking glasses away her eyes marking the spot where\n\n\fMarina had put her glass down on the table.",
    "And then perhaps at\nthe very moment when Marina had been greeting the arrivals from\nthe States with surprise and joyous cries and everybodys eyes\nturned towards their meeting she could have quietly and\nunobtrusively dropped the fatal dose into that glass.",
    "It would\nrequire audacity nerve swiftness.",
    "She would have had all those.",
    "Whatever she had done she would not have looked guilty whilst\nshe was doing it.",
    "It would have been a simple brilliant crime a\ncrime that could hardly fail to be successful.",
    "But chance had ruled\notherwise.",
    "In the rather crowded floorspace someone had jogged\nHeather Badcocks arm.",
    "Her drink had been spilt and Marina with\nher natural impulsive grace had quickly proffered her own glass\nstanding there untouched.",
    "And so the wrong woman had died.",
    "A lot of pure theory and probably hooey at that said Dermot\nCraddock to himself at the same time as he was making polite\nremarks to Ella Zielinsky.",
    "One thing I wanted to ask you Miss Zielinsky.",
    "The catering was\ndone by a Market Basing firm I understand\n\nYes.",
    "Why was that particular firm chosen\n\nI really dont know said Ella.",
    "That doesnt lie amongst my duties.",
    "I\nknow Mr Rudd thought it would be more tactful to employ\nsomebody local rather than to employ a firm from London.",
    "The\nwhole thing was really quite a small affair from our point of view.",
    "Quite.",
    "He watched her as she stood frowning a little looking down.",
    "A good forehead a determined chin a figure which could look quite\nvoluptuous if it was allowed to do so a hard mouth an acquisitive\nmouth.",
    "The eyes He looked at them in surprise.",
    "The lids were\nreddened.",
    "He wondered.",
    "Had she been crying It looked like it.",
    "And\nyet he could have sworn she was not the type of young woman to\ncry.",
    "She looked up at him and as though she read his thoughts she\ntook out her handkerchief and blew her nose heartily.",
    "Youve got a cold he said.",
    "Not a cold.",
    "Hayfever.",
    "Its an allergy of some kind really.",
    "I always\nget at it this time of year.",
    "There was a low buzz.",
    "There were two phones in the room one on\nthe table and one on another table in the corner.",
    "It was the latter\none that was beginning to buzz.",
    "Ella Zielinsky went over to it and\npicked up the receiver.",
    "Yes she said hes here.",
    "Ill bring him up at once.",
    "She put the\nreceiver down again.",
    "Marinas ready for you she said.",
    "III\n\nMarina Gregg received Craddock in a room on the first floor which\nwas obviously her own private sittingroom opening out of her\nbedroom.",
    "After the accounts of her prostration and her nervous\nstate Dermot Craddock had expected to find a fluttering invalid.",
    "But although Marina was half reclining on a sofa her voice was\nvigorous and her eyes were bright.",
    "She had very little makeup on\nbut in spite of this she did not look her age and he was struck very\nforcibly by the subdued radiance of her beauty.",
    "It was the exquisite\nline of cheek and jawbone the way the hair fell loosely and\nnaturally to frame her face.",
    "The long seagreen eyes the pencilled\neyebrows owing something to art but more to nature and the\nwarmth and sweetness of her smile all had a subtle magic.",
    "She\nsaid\n\nChiefInspector Craddock Ive been behaving disgracefully.",
    "I do\napologize.",
    "I just let myself go to pieces after this awful thing.",
    "I could\nhave snapped out of it but I didnt.",
    "Im ashamed of myself.",
    "The smile\ncame rueful sweet turning up the corners of the mouth.",
    "She\nextended a hand and he took it.",
    "It was only natural he said that you should feel upset.",
    "Well everyone was upset said Marina.",
    "Id no business to make\nout it was worse for me than anyone else.",
    "Hadnt you\n\nShe looked at him for a minute and then nodded.",
    "Yes she said\nyoure very perceptive.",
    "Yes I had.",
    "She looked down and with one\nlong forefinger gently stroked the arm of the sofa.",
    "It was a gesture\nhe had noticed in one of her films.",
    "It was a meaningless gesture yet\nit seemed fraught with significance.",
    "It had a kind of musing\ngentleness.",
    "Im a coward she said her eyes still cast down.",
    "Somebody\nwanted to kill me and I didnt want to die.",
    "Why do you think someone wanted to kill you\n\nHer eyes opened wide.",
    "Because it was my glass  my drink  that\nhad been tampered with.",
    "It was just a mistake that that poor stupid\nwoman got it.",
    "Thats whats so horrible and so tragic.",
    "Besides \n\nYes Miss Gregg\n\nShe seemed a little uncertain about saying more.",
    "You had other reasons perhaps for believing that you were the\nintended victim\n\nShe nodded.",
    "What reasons Miss Gregg\n\nShe paused a minute longer before saying Jason says I must tell\nyou all about it.",
    "Youve confided in him then\n\nYes...",
    "I didnt want to at first  but Dr Gilchrist put it to me that I\nmust.",
    "And then I found that he thought so too.",
    "Hed thought it all\nalong but  its rather funny really  a rueful smile curled her lips\nagain  he didnt want to alarm me by telling me.",
    "Really Marina sat\n\n\fup with a sudden vigorous movement.",
    "Darling Jinks Does he think\nIm a complete fool\n\nYou havent told me yet Miss Gregg why you should think anyone\nwanted to kill you.",
    "She was silent for a moment and then with a sudden brusque\ngesture she stretched out for her handbag opened it took out a\npiece of paper and thrust it into his hand.",
    "He read it.",
    "Typed on it\nwas one line of writing\n\nDont think youll escape next time.",
    "Craddock said sharply When did you get this\n\nIt was on my dressingtable when I came back from the bath.",
    "So someone in the house \n\nNot necessarily.",
    "Someone could have climbed up the balcony\noutside my window and pushed it through there.",
    "I think they meant\nit to frighten me still more but actually it didnt.",
    "I just felt furiously\nangry and sent word to you to come and see me.",
    "Dermot Craddock smiled.",
    "Possibly a rather unexpected result for\nwhoever sent it.",
    "Is this the first kind of message like that youve\nhad\n\nAgain Marina hesitated.",
    "Then she said No it isnt.",
    "Will you tell me about any others\n\nIt was three weeks ago when we first came here.",
    "It came to the\nstudio not here.",
    "It was quite ridiculous.",
    "It was just a message.",
    "Not\ntypewritten that time.",
    "In capital letters.",
    "It said Prepare to die.",
    "She laughed.",
    "There was perhaps a very faint tinge of hysteria in the\nlaugh.",
    "The mirth was genuine enough.",
    "It was so silly she said.",
    "Of\ncourse one often gets crank messages threats things like that.",
    "I\nthought it was probably religious you know.",
    "Someone who didnt\napprove of film actresses.",
    "I just tore it up and threw it into the\nwastepaper basket.",
    "Did you tell anyone about it Miss Gregg\n\nMarina shook her head.",
    "No I never said a word to anyone.",
    "As a\nmatter of fact we were having a bit of worry at the moment about\nthe scene we were shooting.",
    "I just couldnt have thought of\nanything but that at the moment.",
    "Anyway as I say I thought it was\neither a silly joke or one of those religious cranks who write and\ndisapprove of playacting and things like that.",
    "And after that was there another\n\nYes.",
    "On the day of the f\u043ate.",
    "One of the gardeners brought it to me I\nthink.",
    "He said someone had left a note for me and was there any\nanswer I thought perhaps it had to do with the arrangements.",
    "I just\ntore it open.",
    "It said Today will be your last day on earth.",
    "I just\ncrumpled it up and said No answer.",
    "Then I called the man back\nand asked him who gave it to him.",
    "He said it was a man with\nspectacles on a bicycle.",
    "Well I mean what could you think about\n\n\fthat I thought it was more silliness.",
    "I didnt think  I didnt think for\na moment it was a real genuine threat.",
    "Wheres that note now Miss Gregg\n\nIve no idea.",
    "I was wearing one of those coloured Italian silk coats\nand I think as far as I remember that I crumpled it up and shoved it\ninto the pocket of it.",
    "But its not there now.",
    "It probably fell out.",
    "And youve no idea who wrote these silly notes Miss Gregg Who\ninspired them Not even now\n\nHer eyes opened widely.",
    "There was a kind of innocent wonder in\nthem that he took note of.",
    "He admired it but he did not believe in it.",
    "How can I tell How can I possibly tell\n\nI think you might have quite a good idea Miss Gregg.",
    "I havent.",
    "I assure you I havent.",
    "Youre a very famous person said Dermot.",
    "Youve had great\nsuccesses.",
    "Successes in your profession and personal successes\ntoo.",
    "Men have fallen in love with you wanted to marry you have\nmarried you.",
    "Women have been jealous and envied you.",
    "Men have\nbeen in love with you and been rebuffed by you.",
    "Its a pretty wild\nfield I agree but I should think you must have some idea who could\nhave written these notes.",
    "It could have been anybody.",
    "No Miss Gregg it couldnt have been anybody.",
    "It could possibly\nhave been one of quite a lot of people.",
    "It could be someone quite\nhumble a dresser an electrician a servant or it could be someone\namong the ranks of your friends or socalled friends.",
    "But you must\nhave some idea.",
    "Some name more than one name perhaps to\nsuggest.",
    "The door opened and Jason Rudd came in.",
    "Marina turned to him.",
    "She swept out an arm appealingly.",
    "Jinks darling Mr Craddock is insisting that I must know who wrote\nthose horrid notes.",
    "And I dont.",
    "You know I dont.",
    "Neither of us\nknows.",
    "We havent got the least idea.",
    "Very urgent about that thought Craddock.",
    "Very urgent.",
    "Is Marina\nGregg afraid of what her husband might say\n\nJason Rudd his eyes dark with fatigue and the scowl on his face\ndeeper than usual came over to join them.",
    "He took Marinas hand in\nhis.",
    "I know it sounds unbelievable to you Inspector he said but\nhonestly neither Marina nor I have any idea about this business.",
    "So youre in the happy position of having no enemies is that it\nThe irony was manifest in Dermots voice.",
    "Jason Rudd flushed a little.",
    "Enemies Thats a very biblical word\nInspector.",
    "In that sense I can assure you I can think of no enemies.",
    "People who dislike one would like to get the better of one would do\na mean turn to one if they could in malice and uncharitableness\nyes.",
    "But its a long step from that to putting an overdose of poison in\na drink.",
    "Just now in speaking to your wife I asked her who could have\nwritten or inspired those letters.",
    "She said she didnt know but\nwhen we come to the actual action it narrows it down.",
    "Somebody\nactually put the poison in that glass.",
    "And thats a fairly limited field\nyou know.",
    "I saw nothing said Jason Rudd.",
    "I certainly didnt said Marina.",
    "Well I mean  if I had see anyone\nputting anything in my glass I wouldnt have drunk the stuff would\nI\n\nI cant help believing you know said Dermot Craddock gently\nthat you do know a little more than youre telling me\n\nIts not true said Marina.",
    "Tell him that that isnt true.",
    "I assure you said Jason Rudd that I am completely a absolutely\nat a loss.",
    "The whole things fantastic.",
    "I might believe it was a joke  a\njoke that had somehow gone wrong  that had proved dangerous\ndone by a person who never dreamt that it would be dangerous...",
    "There was a slight question in his voice then he shook his head.",
    "No.",
    "I see that idea doesnt appeal to you.",
    "Theres one more thing I should like to ask you said Dermot\nCraddock.",
    "You remember Mr and Mrs Badcocks arrival of course.",
    "They came immediately after the vicar.",
    "You greeted them I\nunderstand Miss Gregg in the same charming way as you had\nreceived all your guests.",
    "But I am told by an eyewitness that\nimmediately after greeting them you looked over Mrs Badcocks\nshoulder and that you saw something which seemed to alarm you.",
    "Is that true and if so what was it\n\nMarina said quickly Of course it isnt true.",
    "Alarm me  what should\nhave alarmed me\n\nThats what we want to know said Dermot Craddock patiently.My\nwitness is very insistent on the point you know.",
    "Who was your witness What did he or she say she saw\n\nYou were looking at the staircase said Dermot Craddock.",
    "There\nwere people coming up the staircase.",
    "There was a journalist there\nwas Mr Grice and his wife elderly residents in this place there was\nMr Ardwyck Fenn who had just arrived from the States and there\nwas Miss Lola Brewster.",
    "Was it the sight of one of those people that\nupset you Miss Gregg\n\nI tell you I wasnt upset.",
    "She almost barked the words.",
    "And yet\nyour attention wavered from greeting Mrs Badcock.",
    "She had said\nsomething to you which you left unanswered because you were\nstaring past her at something else.",
    "Marina Gregg took hold on herself.",
    "She spoke quickly and\nconvincingly.",
    "I can explain I really can.",
    "If you knew anything about acting youd\nbe able to understand quite easily.",
    "There comes a moment even\nwhen you know a part well  in fact it usually happens when you do\nknow a part well  when you go on with it mechanically.",
    "Smiling\nmaking the proper movements and gestures saying the words with\nthe usual inflexions.",
    "But your mind isnt on it.",
    "And quite suddenly\ntheres a horrible blank moment when you dont know where you\nare where youve got to in the play what your next lines are Drying\nup thats what we call it.",
    "Well thats what happened to me.",
    "Im not\nterribly strong as my husband will tell you.",
    "Ive had rather a\nstrenuous time and a good deal of nervous apprehension about\nthis film.",
    "I wanted to make a success of this f\u043ate and to be nice and\npleasant and welcoming to everybody.",
    "But one does say the same\nthings over and over again mechanically to the people who are\nalways saying the same things to you.",
    "You know how theyve\nalways wanted to meet you.",
    "How they once saw you outside a\ntheatre in San Francisco  or travelled in a plane with you.",
    "Something silly really but one has to be nice about it and say\nthings.",
    "Well as Im telling you one does that automatically.",
    "One\ndoesnt need to think what to say because ones said it so often\nbefore.",
    "Suddenly I think a wave of tiredness came over me.",
    "My\nbrain went blank.",
    "Then I realized that Mrs Badcock had been telling\nme a long story which I hadnt really heard at all and was now\nlooking at me in an eager sort of way and that I hadnt answered her\nor said any of the proper things.",
    "It was just tiredness.",
    "Just tiredness said Dermot Craddock slowly.",
    "You insist on that\nMiss Gregg\n\nYes I do.",
    "I cant see why you dont believe me.",
    "Dermot Craddock turned towards Jason Rudd.",
    "Mr Rudd he said I\nthink youre more likely to understand my meaning than your wife\nis.",
    "I am concerned very much concerned for your wifes safety.",
    "There has been an attempt on her life there have been threatening\nletters.",
    "That means doesnt it that there is someone who was here\non the day of the f\u043ate and possibly is still here someone in very\nclose touch with this house and what goes on in it.",
    "That person\nwhoever it is may be slightly insane.",
    "Its not just a question of\nthreats.",
    "Threatened men live long as they say.",
    "The same goes for\nwomen.",
    "But whoever it was didnt stop at threats.",
    "A deliberate\nattempt was made to poison Miss Gregg.",
    "Dont you see in the whole\nnature of things that the attempt is bound to be repeated Theres\nonly one way to achieve safety.",
    "That is to give me all the clues you\npossibly can.",
    "I dont say that you know who that person is but I\nthink that you must be able to give a guess or to have a vague idea.",
    "Wont you tell me the truth Or if which is possible you yourself do\nnot know the truth wont you urge your wife to do so.",
    "Its in the\ninterests of her own safety that Im asking you.",
    "Jason Rudd turned his head slowly.",
    "You hear what Inspector\nCraddock says Marina he said.",
    "Its possible as he says that you\nmay know something that I do not.",
    "If so for Gods sake dont be\nfoolish about it.",
    "If youve the least suspicion of anyone tell it to us\nnow.",
    "But I havent.",
    "Her voice rose in a wail.",
    "You must believe me.",
    "Who were you afraid of that day asked Dermot.",
    "I wasnt afraid of anyone.",
    "Listen Miss Gregg of the people on the stairs or coming up it\nthere were two friends whom you were surprised to see whom you\nhad not seen for a long time and whom you did not expect to see\nthat day.",
    "Mr Ardwyck Fern and Miss Brewster.",
    "Had you any special\nemotions when you suddenly saw them coming up the stairs You\ndidnt know they were coming did you\n\nNo wed no idea they were even in England said Jason Rudd.",
    "I was delighted said Marina absolutely delighted\n\nDelighted to see Miss Brewster\n\nWell  she shot him a quick faintly suspicious glance.",
    "Craddock said Lola Brewster was I believe originally married to\nyour third husband Robert Truscott\n\nYes thats so.",
    "He divorced her in order to marry you.",
    "Oh everyone knows about that said Marina Gregg impatiently.",
    "You neednt think its anything youve found out.",
    "There was a bit of\n\n\fa rumpus at the time but there wasnt any bad feeling about it in the\nend.",
    "Did she make threats against you\n\nWell  in a way yes.",
    "But oh dear I wish I could explain.",
    "No one\ntakes those sort of threats seriously.",
    "It was at a party shed had a\nlot of drink.",
    "She might have taken a potshot at me with a pistol if\nshed had one.",
    "But luckily she didnt.",
    "All that was years ago None\nof these things last these emotions They dont really they dont.",
    "Thats true isnt it Jason\n\nId say it was true enough said Jason Rudd and I can assure you\nMr Craddock that Lola Brewster had no opportunity on the day of\nthe f\u043ate of poisoning my wifes drink.",
    "I was close beside her most of\nthe time.",
    "The idea that Lola would suddenly after a long period of\nfriendliness come to England and arrive at our house all prepared\nto poison my wifes drink  why the whole ideas absurd.",
    "I appreciate your point of view said Craddock.",
    "Its not only that its a matter of fact as well.",
    "She was nowhere near\nMarinas glass.",
    "And your other visitor  Ardwyck Fern\n\nThere was he thought a very slight pause before Jason Rudd\nspoke.",
    "Hes a very old friend of ours he said.",
    "We havent se him for a\ngood many years now though we occasionally correspond.",
    "Hes\nquite a big figure in American Television.",
    "Was he an old friend of yours too Dermot Craddock asked\nMarina.",
    "Her breath came rather quickly as she replied.",
    "Yes oh yes.",
    "He  he\nwas quite a friend of mine always but Ive rather lost sight of him of\nlate years.",
    "Then with a sudden quick rush of words she went on If\nyou think that I looked up and saw Ardwyck and was frightened of\nhim its nonsense.",
    "Its absolute nonsense.",
    "Why should I be\nfrightened of him what reason would I have to be frightened of\nhim We were great friends.",
    "I was just very very pleased when I\nsuddenly saw him.",
    "It was a delightful surprise as I told you.",
    "Yes a\ndelightful surprise.",
    "She raised her head looking at him her face\nvivid and defiant.",
    "Thank you Miss Gregg said Craddock quietly.",
    "If you should feel\ninclined at any moment to take me a little further into your\nconfidence I should strongly advise you to do so.",
    "Chapter 14\n\nMrs Bantry was on her knees.",
    "A good day for hoeing.",
    "Nice dry soil.",
    "But hoeing wouldnt do everything.",
    "Thistles now and dandelions.",
    "She dealt vigorously with these pests.",
    "She rose to her feet breathless but triumphant and looked out\nover the hedge on to the road.",
    "She was faintly surprised to see the\ndarkhaired secretary whose name she couldnt remember coming\nout of the public call box that was situated near the bus stop on the\nother side of the road.",
    "What was her name now.",
    "It began with a B  or was it an R No\nZielinsky that was it.",
    "Mrs Bantry remembered just in time as Ella\ncrossed the road into the drive past the Lodge.",
    "Good morning Miss Zielinsky she called in a friendly tone.",
    "Ella Zielinsky jumped.",
    "It was not so much a jump as a shy  the shy\nof a frightened horse.",
    "It surprised Mrs Bantry.",
    "Good morning said Ella and added quickly I came down to\ntelephone.",
    "Theres something wrong with our line today.",
    "Mrs Bantry felt more surprise.",
    "She wondered why Ella Zielinsky\nbothered to explain her action.",
    "She responded civilly.",
    "How\nannoying for you.",
    "Do come in and telephone any time you want to.",
    "Oh  thank you very much... Ella was interrupted by a fit of\nsneezing.",
    "Youve got hayfever said Mrs Bantry with immediate diagnosis.",
    "Try weak bicarbonate of soda and water.",
    "Oh thats all right.",
    "I have some very good patent stuff in an\natomizer.",
    "Thank you all the same.",
    "She sneezed again as she moved away walking briskly up the\ndrive.",
    "Mrs Bantry looked after her.",
    "Then her eyes returned to her garden.",
    "She looked at it in a dissatisfied fashion.",
    "Not a weed to be seen\nanywhere.",
    "Othellos occupations gone Mrs Bantry murmured to herself\nconfusedly.",
    "I dare say Im a nosy old woman but I would like to\nknow if \n\nA moment of irresolution and then Mrs Bantry yielded to temptation.",
    "She was going to be a nosy old woman and the hell with it She\nstrode indoors to the telephone lifted the receiver and dialled it.",
    "A\nbrisk transatlantic voice spoke.",
    "Gossington Hall.",
    "This is Mrs Bantry at the East Lodge.",
    "Oh good morning Mrs Bantry.",
    "This is Halley Preston.",
    "I met you on\nthe day of the f\u043ate.",
    "What can I do for you\n\nI thought perhaps I could do something for you.",
    "If your telephones\nout of order \n\nHis astonished voice interrupted her.",
    "Our telephone out of order Theres been nothing wrong with it.",
    "Why did you think so\n\nI must have made a mistake said Mrs Bantry.",
    "I dont always hear\nvery well she explained unblushingly.",
    "She put the receiver back waited a minute then dialled once more.",
    "Jane Dolly here.",
    "Yes Dolly.",
    "What is it\n\nWell it seems rather odd.",
    "The secretary woman was dialling from\nthe public call box in the road.",
    "She took the trouble to explain to me\nquite unnecessarily that she was doing so because the line at\nGossington Hall was out of order.",
    "But Ive rung up there and it\nisnt...\n\nShe paused and waited for intelligence to pronounce.",
    "Indeed said Miss Marple thoughtfully.",
    "Interesting.",
    "For what reason do you think\n\nWell clearly she didnt want to be overheard \n\nExactly.",
    "And there might be quite a number of reasons for that.",
    "Yes.",
    "Interesting said Miss Marple again.",
    "II\n\nNobody could have been more ready to talk than Donald McNeil.",
    "He\nwas an amiable redheaded young man.",
    "He greeted Dermot\nCraddock with pleasure and curiosity.",
    "How are you getting along he asked cheerfully got any little\nspecial titbit for me\n\nNot as yet.",
    "Later perhaps.",
    "Stalling as usual.",
    "Youre all the same.",
    "Affable oysters Havent you\ncome to the stage yet of inviting someone to come and assist you\nin your inquiries\n\nIve come to you said Dermot Craddock with a grin.",
    "Is there a nasty double entendre in that remark Are you really\nsuspicious that I murdered Heather Badcock and do you think I did\nit in mistake for Marina Gregg or that I meant to murder Heather\nBadcock all the time\n\nI havent suggested anything said Craddock.",
    "No no you wouldnt do that would you Youd be very correct.",
    "All\nright.",
    "Lets go into it.",
    "I was there.",
    "I had opportunity but had I any\nmotive Ah thats what youd like to know.",
    "What was my motive\n\nI havent been able to find one so far said Craddock.",
    "Thats very gratifying.",
    "I feel safer.",
    "Im just interested in what you may have seen that day.",
    "Youve had that already.",
    "The local police had that straight away.",
    "Its humiliating.",
    "There I was on the scene of a murder.",
    "I practically\nsaw the murder committed must have done and yet Ive no idea\nwho did it.",
    "Im ashamed to confess that the first I knew about it was\nseeing the poor dear woman sitting on a chair gasping for breath\nand then pegging out.",
    "Of course it made a very good eyewitness\naccount.",
    "It was a good scoop for me  and all that.",
    "But Ill confess to\nyou that I feel humiliated that I dont know more.",
    "I ought to know\nmore.",
    "And you cant kid me that the dose was meant for Heather\nBadcock.",
    "She was a nice woman who talked too much but nobody\ngets murdered for that  unless of course they give away secrets.",
    "But I dont think anybody would ever have told Heather Badcock a\nsecret.",
    "She wasnt the kind of woman whod have been interested in\nother peoples secrets.",
    "My view of her is of a woman who invariably\ntalked about herself.",
    "That seems to be the generally accepted view agreed Craddock.",
    "So we come to the famous Marina Gregg.",
    "Im sure there are lots of\nwonderful motives for murdering Marina.",
    "Envy and jealousy and\n\n\flove tangles  all the stuff of drama.",
    "But who did it Someone with a\nscrew loose I presume.",
    "There Youve had my valuable opinion.",
    "Is\nthat what you wanted\n\nNot that alone.",
    "I understand that you arrived and came up the\nstairs about the same time as the vicar and the mayor.",
    "Quite correct.",
    "But that wasnt the first time Id arrived.",
    "Id been\nthere earlier.",
    "I didnt know that.",
    "Yes.",
    "I was on a kind of roving commission you know going here\nand there.",
    "I had a photographer with me.",
    "Id gone down to take a\nfew local shots of the mayor arriving and throwing a hoopla and\nputting in a peg for buried treasure and that kind of thing.",
    "Then I\nwent back up again not so much on the job as to get a drink or\ntwo.",
    "The drink was good.",
    "I see.",
    "Now can you remember who else was on the staircase when\nyou went up\n\nMargot Bence from London was there with her camera.",
    "You know her well\n\nOh I just run against her quite often.",
    "Shes a clever girl who makes\na success of her stuff.",
    "She takes all the fashionable things  First\nNights Gala Performances  specializes in photographs from\nunusual angles.",
    "Arty She was in a corner of the half landing very\n\n\fwell placed for taking anyone who came up and for taking the\ngreetings going on at the top.",
    "Lola Brewster was just ahead of me\non the stairs.",
    "Didnt know her at first.",
    "Shes got a new rustred hairdo.",
    "The very latest Fiji Islander type.",
    "Last time I saw her it was lank\nwaves falling round her face and chin in a nice shade of auburn.",
    "There was a big dark man with her American.",
    "I dont know who he\nwas but he looked important.",
    "Did you look at Marina Gregg herself at all as you were coming up\n\nYes of course I did.",
    "She didnt look upset or as though shed had a shock or was\nfrightened\n\nIts odd you should say that.",
    "I did think for a moment or two she\nwas going to faint.",
    "I see said Craddock thoughtfully.",
    "Thanks.",
    "Theres nothing else\nyoud like to tell me\n\nMcNeil gave him a wide innocent stare.",
    "What could there be\n\nI dont trust you said Craddock.",
    "But you seem quite sure I didnt do it.",
    "Disappointing.",
    "Suppose I turn\nout to be her first husband.",
    "Nobody knows who he was except that\nhe was so insignificant that even his names been forgotten.",
    "Dermot grinned.",
    "Married from your prep school he asked.",
    "Or possibly in rompers\nI must hurry.",
    "Ive got a train to catch.",
    "III\n\nThere was a neatly docketed pile of papers on Craddocks desk at\nNew Scotland Yard.",
    "He gave a perfunctory glance through them\nthen threw a question over his shoulder.",
    "Wheres Lola Brewster staying\n\nAt the Savoy sir.",
    "Suite 1800.",
    "Shes expecting you.",
    "And Ardwyck Fern\n\nHes at the Dorchester.",
    "First floor 190.",
    "He picked up some cablegrams and read through them again\nbefore shoving them into his pocket.",
    "He smiled a moment to himself\nover the last one.",
    "Dont say I dont do my stuff Aunt Jane he\nmurmured under his breath.",
    "He went out and made his way to the Savoy.",
    "In Lola Brewsters suite Lola went out of her way to welcome him\neffusively.",
    "With the report he had just read in his mind he studied\nher carefully.",
    "Quite a beauty still he thought in a lush kind of way\nwhat you might call a trifle overblown perhaps but they still liked\nthem that way.",
    "A completely different type of course from Marina\nGregg.",
    "The amenities over Lola pushed back her Fiji Islander hair\ndrew her generous lipsticked mouth into a provocative pout and\nflickering blue eyelids over wide brown eyes said\n\nHave you come to ask me a lot more horrible questions Like that\nlocal inspector did.",
    "I hope they wont be too horrible Miss Brewster.",
    "Oh but Im sure they will be and Im sure the whole thing must\nhave been some terrible mistake.",
    "Do you really think so\n\nYes.",
    "Its all such nonsense.",
    "Do you really mean that someone tried\nto poison Marina Who on earth would poison Marina Shes an\nabsolute sweetie you know.",
    "Everybody loves her.",
    "Including you\n\nIve always been devoted to Marina.",
    "Oh come now Miss Brewster wasnt there a little trouble about\neleven or twelve years ago\n\n\fOh that.",
    "Lola waved it away.",
    "I was terribly nervy and distraught\nand Rob and I had been having the most frightful quarrels.",
    "We were\nneither of us normal at the moment.",
    "Marina just fell wildly in love\nwith him and rushed him off his feet the poor pet.",
    "And you minded very much\n\nWell I thought I did Inspector.",
    "Of course I see now it was one of\nthe best things that ever happened for me.",
    "I was really worried\nabout the children you know.",
    "Breaking up our home.",
    "Im afraid Id\nalready realized that Rob and I were incompatible.",
    "I expect you\nknow I got married to Eddie Groves as soon as the divorce went\nthrough I think really Id been in love with him for a long time but\nof course I didnt want to break up my marriage because of the\nchildren.",
    "Its so important isnt it that children should have a\nhome\n\nYet people say that actually you were terribly upset.",
    "Oh people always say things said Lola vaguely.",
    "You said quite a lot didnt you Miss Brewster You went about\nthreatening to shoot Marina Gregg or so I understand.",
    "Ive told you one says things.",
    "Ones supposed to say things like\nthat.",
    "Of course I wouldnt really shoot anyone.",
    "In spite of taking a potshot at Eddie Groves some few years later\n\n\fOh that was because wed had an argument said Lola.",
    "I lost my\ntemper.",
    "I have it on very good authority Miss Brewster that you said  and\nthese are your exact words or so Im told he read from a notebook  That bitch neednt think shell get away with it.",
    "If I dont\nshoot her now Ill wait and get her in some other way.",
    "I dont care\nhow long I wait years if need be but Ill get even with her in the\nend.",
    "Oh Im sure I never said anything of the kind Lola laughed.",
    "Im sure Miss Brewster that you did.",
    "People exaggerate so.",
    "A charming smile broke over her face.",
    "I\nwas just mad at the moment you know she murmured\nconfidentially.",
    "One says all sorts of things when ones mad with\npeople.",
    "But you dont really think Id wait fourteen years and come\nacross to England and look up Marina and drop some deadly\npoison into her cocktail glass within three minutes of seeing her\nagain\n\nDermot Craddock didnt really think so.",
    "It seemed to him wildly\nimprobable.",
    "He merely said\n\nIm only pointing out to you Miss Brewster that there had been\nthreats in the past and that Marina Gregg was certainly startled and\nfrightened to see someone who came up the stairs that day.",
    "Naturally one feels that that someone must have been you.",
    "But darling Marina was delighted to see me She kissed me and\nexclaimed how wonderful it was.",
    "Oh really Inspector I do think\nyoure being very very silly.",
    "In fact you were all one big happy family\n\nWell thats really much more true than all the things youve been\nthinking.",
    "And youve no ideas that could help us in any way No ideas who\nmight have killed her\n\nI tell you nobody would have wanted to kill Marina.",
    "Shes a very silly\nwoman anyway.",
    "Always making terrible fusses about her health\nand changing her mind and wanting this that and the other and\nwhen shes got it being dissatisfied with it I cant think why people\nare as fond of her as they are.",
    "Jasons always been absolutely mad\nabout her.",
    "What that man has to put up with But there it is.",
    "Everybody puts up with Marina puts themselves out for her.",
    "Then\nshe gives them a sad sweet and thanks them And apparently that\nmakes them feel that all the trouble is worthwhile.",
    "I really dont\nknow how she does it.",
    "Youd better put the idea that somebody\nwanted to kill right out of your head.",
    "I should like to said Dermot Craddock.",
    "Unfortunately I cant put it\nout of my head because you see it happened.",
    "What do you mean it happened nobody has killed Marina have\nthey\n\n\fNo.",
    "But the attempt was made.",
    "I dont believe it for a moment I expect whoever it was meant to kill\nthe other woman all the time  the one who was killed.",
    "I expect\nsomeone comes into money when she dies.",
    "She hadnt any money Miss Brewster.",
    "Oh well there was some other reason.",
    "Anyway I shouldnt worry\nabout Marina if I were you.",
    "Marina is always all right\n\nIs she She doesnt look a very happy woman to me.",
    "Oh thats because she makes such a song and dance about\neverything.",
    "Unhappy love affairs.",
    "Not being able to have any\nchildren.",
    "She adopted some children didnt she said Dermot with a lively\nremembrance of Miss Marples urgent voice.",
    "I believe she did once.",
    "It wasnt a great success I believe.",
    "She does\nthese impulsive things and then wishes she hadnt.",
    "What happened to the children she adopted\n\nIve no idea.",
    "They just sort of vanished after a bit.",
    "She got tired of\nthem I suppose like everything else.",
    "I see said Dermot Craddock.",
    "IV\n\nNext  the Dorchester.",
    "Suite 190.",
    "Well ChiefInspector  Ardwyck Fenn looked down at the card in\nhis hand.",
    "Craddock.",
    "What can I do for you\n\nI hope you wont mind if I ask you a few questions.",
    "Not at all.",
    "Its this business at Much Benham.",
    "No  whats the actual\nname St Mary Mead\n\nYes.",
    "Thats right.",
    "Gossington Hall.",
    "Cant think what Jason Rudd wanted to buy a place like that for.",
    "Plenty of good Georgian houses in England  or even Queen Anne.",
    "Gossington Hall is a purely Victorian mansion.",
    "Wheres the\nattraction in that I wonder\n\nOh theres some attraction  for some people that is in Victorian\nstability.",
    "Stability Well perhaps youve got something there.",
    "Marina I\nsuppose had a feeling for stability.",
    "Its a thing she never had\nherself poor girl so I suppose thats why she always covets it.",
    "Perhaps this place will satisfy her for a bit.",
    "You know her well Mr Fenn\n\nArdwyck Fern shrugged his shoulders.",
    "Well I dont know that Id say that.",
    "Ive known her over a long\nperiod of years.",
    "Known her off and on that is to say.",
    "Craddock looked at him appraisingly.",
    "A dark man heavily built\nshrewd eyes behind thick glasses heavy jowl and chin Ardwyck\nFenn went on\n\nThe idea is I gather from what I read in the newspapers that this\nMrs Whateverhernamewas was poisoned by mistake.",
    "That the\ndose was intended for Marina.",
    "Is that right\n\nYes.",
    "Thats it.",
    "The dose was in Marina Greggs cocktail.",
    "Mrs\nBadcock spilt hers and Marina handed over her drink to her.",
    "Well that seems pretty conclusive.",
    "I really cant think though who\nwould want to poison Marina.",
    "Especially as Lynette Brown wasnt\nthere.",
    "Lynette Brown Craddock looked slightly at sea.",
    "Ardwyck Fenn smiled.",
    "If Marina breaks this contract throws up the\npart  Lynette will get it and it would mean a good deal to Lynette to\nget it.",
    "But for all that I dont imagine shed send some emissary\nalong with poison.",
    "Much too melodramatic an idea.",
    "It seems a little farfetched said Dermot dryly.",
    "Ah youd be surprised what women will do when theyre\nambitious said Ardwyck Fenn.",
    "Mind you death maynt have been\nintended.",
    "It may have been just to give her a fright  Enough to\nknock her out but not to finish her.",
    "Craddock shook his head.",
    "It wasnt a borderline dose he said.",
    "People make mistakes in doses quite big ones.",
    "Is this really your theory\n\nOh no it isnt.",
    "It was only a suggestion.",
    "Ive no theory.",
    "I was only an\ninnocent bystander.",
    "Was Marina Gregg very surprised to see you\n\nYes it was a complete surprise to her.",
    "He laughed amusedly.",
    "Just\ncouldnt believe her eyes when she saw me coming up the stairs.",
    "She gave me a very nice welcome I must say.",
    "You hadnt seen her for a long time\n\nNot for four or five years I should say.",
    "And some years before that there was a time when you and she\nwere very close friends I believe\n\nThere was very little change in the voice but there was something\nthere that had not been there before.",
    "A hint of steel of menace.",
    "Dermot felt suddenly that this man would be a very ruthless\nopponent.",
    "It would be as well I think said Ardwyck Fenn that you said\nexactly what you do mean.",
    "Im quite prepared to do so Mr Fern.",
    "I have to inquire into the past\nrelations of everyone who was there on that day with Marina Gregg.",
    "It seems to have been a matter of common gossip that at the time I\nhave just referred to you were wildly in love with Marina Gregg.",
    "Ardwyck Fenn shrugged his shoulders.",
    "One has these infatuations Inspector.",
    "Fortunately they pass.",
    "It is said that she encouraged you and that later she turned you\ndown and that you resented the fact.",
    "It is said  it is said I suppose you read all that in Confidential\n\nIt has been told me by quite well informed and sensible people.",
    "Ardwyck Fern threw back his head showing the bulllike line of his\nneck.",
    "I had a yen for her at one time yes he admitted.",
    "She was a\nbeautiful and attractive woman and still is.",
    "To say that I ever\nthreatened her is going a little too far.",
    "Im never pleased to be\nthwarted ChiefInspector and most people who thwart me tend to\nbe sorry that they have done so.",
    "But that principle applies mainly in\nmy business life.",
    "You did I believe use your influence to have her dropped from a\npicture that she was making\n\nFenn shrugged his shoulders.",
    "She was unsuitable for the role.",
    "There was conflict between her\nand the director.",
    "I had money in that picture and I had no intention\nof jeopardizing it.",
    "It was I assure you purely a business\ntransaction.",
    "But perhaps Marina Gregg did not think so\n\nOh naturally she did not think so.",
    "She would always think that\nanything like that was personal.",
    "She actually told certain friends of hers that she was afraid of you I\nbelieve\n\nDid she How childish.",
    "I expect she enjoyed the sensation.",
    "You think there was no need for her to be afraid of you\n\n\fOf course not.",
    "Whatever personal disappointment I might have\nhad I soon put it behind me.",
    "Ive always gone on the principle that\nwhere women are concerned there are as good fish in the sea as\never came out of it.",
    "A very satisfactory way to go through life Mr Fenn.",
    "Yes I think it is.",
    "You have a wide knowledge of the moving picture world\n\nI have financial interests in it.",
    "And therefore you are bound to know a lot about it\n\nPerhaps.",
    "You are a man whose judgement would be worth listening to.",
    "Can\nyou suggest to me any person who is likely to have such a deep\ngrudge against Marina Gregg that they would be willing to do away\nwith her\n\nProbably a dozen said Ardwyck Fern that is to say if they hadnt\ngot to do anything about it personally.",
    "If it was mere matter of\npressing a button in a wall I dare say thered be a lot of willing\nfingers.",
    "You were there that day.",
    "You saw her and talked to her.",
    "Do you\nthink that amongst any of the people who were around you in that\nbrief space of time  from when you arrived to the moment when\n\n\fHeather Badcock died  do you think that amongst them you can\nsuggest  only suggest mind you Im asking you for nothing more\nthan a guess  anyone who might poison Marina Gregg\n\nI wouldnt like to say said Ardwyck Fenn.",
    "That means that you have some idea\n\nIt means that I have nothing to say on that subject.",
    "And that ChiefInspector Craddock is all youll get out of me.",
    "Chapter 15\n\nDermot Craddock looked down at the last name and address he\nhad written down in his notebook.",
    "The telephone number had been\nrung twice for him but there had been no response.",
    "He tried it now\nonce more.",
    "He shrugged his shoulders got up and decided to go\nand see for himself.",
    "Margot Bences studio was in a culdesac off the Tottenharn Court\nRoad.",
    "Beyond the name on a plate on the side of a door there was\nlittle to identify it and certainly no form of advertising.",
    "Craddock\ngroped his way to the first floor.",
    "There was a large notice here\npainted in black on a white board Margot Bence Personality\nPhotographer.",
    "Please enter.",
    "Craddock entered.",
    "There was a small waitingroom but nobody in\ncharge of it.",
    "He stood there hesitating then cleared his throat in a\n\n\floud and theatrical manner.",
    "Since that drew no attention he raised\nhis voice.",
    "Anybody here\n\nHe heard a flap of slippers behind a velvet curtain the curtain was\npushed aside and a young man with exuberant hair and a pink and\nwhite face peered round it.",
    "Terribly sorry my dear he said.",
    "I didnt hear you.",
    "I had an\nabsolutely new idea and I was just trying it out.",
    "He pushed the velvet curtain farther aside and Craddock followed\nhim into an inner room.",
    "This proved to be unexpectedly large.",
    "It was\nclearly the working studio.",
    "There were cameras lights arclights\npiles of drapery screens on wheels.",
    "Such a mess said the young man who was almost as willowy as\nHailey Preston.",
    "But one finds it very hard to work I think unless\none does get into a mess.",
    "Now what were you wanting to see us\nabout\n\nI wanted to see Miss Margot Bence.",
    "Ah Margot.",
    "Now what a pity.",
    "If youd been half an hour earlier\nyoud have found her here.",
    "Shes gone off to produce some\nphotographs of models for Fashion Dream.",
    "You should have rung\nup you know to make an appointment.",
    "Margots terribly busy these\ndays.",
    "I did ring up.",
    "There was no reply.",
    "Of course said the young man.",
    "We took the receiver off.",
    "I\nremember now.",
    "It disturbed us.",
    "He smoothed down a kind of lilac\nsmock that he was wearing.",
    "Can I do anything for you Make an\nappointment I do a lot of Margots business arrangements for her.",
    "You wanted to arrange for some photography somewhere Private\nor business\n\nFrom that point of view neither said Dermot Craddock.",
    "He\nhanded his card to the young man.",
    "How perfectly rapturous said the young man.",
    "C.I.D.",
    "I believe you\nknow Ive seen pictures of you.",
    "Are you one of the Big Four or the\nBig Five or is it perhaps the Big Six nowadays Theres so much\ncrime about theyd have to increase the numbers wouldnt they\nOh dear is that disrespectful Im afraid it is.",
    "I didnt mean to be\ndisrespectful at all.",
    "Now what do you want Margot for  not to\narrest her I hope.",
    "I just wanted to ask her one or two questions.",
    "She doesnt do indecent photographs or anything like that said\nthe young man anxiously.",
    "I hope nobodys been telling you any\nstories of that kind because it isnt true.",
    "Margots very artistic.",
    "She\ndoes a lot of stage work and studio work.",
    "But her studies are\nterribly terribly pure  almost prudish Id say.",
    "I can tell you quite simply why I want to speak to Miss Bence said\nDermot.",
    "She was recently an eyewitness of a crime that took place\nnear Much Benham at a village called St Mary Mead.",
    "Oh my dear of course I know about that.",
    "Margot came back and\ntold me all about it.",
    "Hemlock in the cocktails wasnt it Something\nof that kind.",
    "So bleak it sounded But all mixed up with the St John\nAmbulance which doesnt seem so bleak does it But havent you\nalready asked Margot questions about that  or was it somebody\nelse\n\nOne always finds there are more questions as the case goes on\nsaid Dermot.",
    "You mean it develops.",
    "Yes I can quite see that.",
    "Murder develops.",
    "Yes like a photograph isnt it\n\nIts very much like photography really said Dermot.",
    "Quite a good\ncomparison of yours.",
    "Well its very nice of you to say so Im sure.",
    "Now about Margot.",
    "Would you like to get hold of her right away\n\nIf you can help me to do so yes.",
    "Well at the moment said the young man consulting his watch at\nthe moment shell be outside Keats house at Hampstead Heath.",
    "My\ncars outside.",
    "Shall I run you up there\n\nThat would be very kind of you Mr \n\n\fJethroe said the young man Johnny Jethroe.",
    "As they went down the stairs Dermot asked Why Keats house\n\nWell you know we dont pose fashion photographs in the studio\nany more.",
    "We like them to seem natural blown about by the wind.",
    "And if possible some rather unlikely background.",
    "You know an\nAscot frock against Wandsworth Prison or a frivolous suit outside\na poets house.",
    "Mr Jethroe drove rapidly but skilfully up Tottenham Court Road\nthrough Camden Town and finally to the neighbourhood of\nHampstead Heath.",
    "On the pavement near Keats house a pretty\nlittle scene was being enacted.",
    "A slim girl wearing diaphanous\norgandie was standing clutching an immense black hat.",
    "On her\nknees a little way behind her a second girl was holding the first\ngirls skirt well pulled back so that it clung around her knees and\nlegs.",

    "Sometimes perhaps an\ninternational one.",
    "And he decided did he that this was an international one\n\n\fTransatlantic perhaps would be a better word.",

    "You could get a lot of\ndifferent angles without having to move much.",
    "I know of course that you answered some questions at the time as\nto whether youd seen anything unusual anything that might be\nhelpful.",
    "They were general questions.",
    "Have you got more specialized ones\n\nA little more specialized I think.",

    "She shook her head.",
    "Sorry.",
    "I still dont remember her.",
    "That doesnt matter so much.",

    "He waited wondering what it was she was turning over\nin her mind.",
    "She said at last abruptly\n\nWhy do you ask me that\n\nBecause its a question to which I am very anxious to have an\nanswer  a reliable answer.",
    "Do you think my answers likely to be reliable\n\nYes I do as a matter of fact.",
    "You must have the habit of watching\npeoples faces very closely waiting for certain expressions certain\npropitious moments.",
    "She nodded her head.",

    "But Marina Gregg\nwas not looking at the woman.",
    "Her eyes stared not quite into the\ncamera but slightly obliquely to the left.",
    "The interesting thing to\nDermot Craddock was that the face expressed nothing whatever.",
    "There was no fear on it no pain.",
    "The woman portrayed there was\nstaring at something something she saw and the emotion it\naroused in her was so great that she was phsyically unable to\nexpress it by any kind of facial expression.",
    "Dermot Craddock had\nseen such a look once on a mans face a man who a second later\nhad been shot dead...",

    "Prove it.",

    "Everyone knows\nthat.",
    "Its absolutely recognized in musical circles.",
    "And what about\ntheir cat  always coming over into our garden digging up the beds\njust when Ive got it nice.",
    "I tell you what Jim.",
    "Im fed up with this place.",
    "You didnt mind your neighbours up in Huddersfield remarked\nJim.",
    "It wasnt the same there said Cherry.",
    "I mean youre all\nindependent there.",
    "If youre in trouble somebodyd give you a hand\nand youd give a hand to them.",
    "But you dont interfere.",
    "Theres\nsomething about a new estate like this that makes people look\nsideways at their neighbours.",
    "Because were all new I suppose.",
    "The\namount of backbiting and taletelling and writing to the council and\none thing and another round here beats me People in real towns\nare too busy for it.",
    "You may have something there my girl.",
    "Dyou like it here Jim\n\nThe jobs all right.",
    "And after all this is a brand new house.",
    "I wish\nthere was a bit more room in it so that I could spread myself a bit\nmore.",
    "It would be fine if I could have a workshop.",
    "I thought it was lovely at first said Cherry but now Im not so\nsure.",
    "The house is all right and I love the blue paint and the\nbathrooms nice but I dont like the people and the feeling round\nhere.",
    "Did I tell you that Lily Price and that Harry of hers have broken\noff It was a funny business that day in that house they went to look\nover.",
    "You know when she more or less fell out of the window.",
    "She\nsaid Harry just stood there like a stuck pig.",
    "Im glad shes broken off with him.",
    "Hes a nogood if I ever saw one\nsaid Jim.",
    "No good marrying a chap just because a babys on the way said\nCherry.",
    "He didnt want to marry her you know.",
    "Hes not a very nice\nfellow.",
    "Miss Marple said he wasnt she added thoughtfully.",
    "She\nspoke to Lily about him.",
    "Lily thought she was crackers.",
    "Miss Marple I didnt know shed ever seen him\n\nOh yes she was round here walking the day she fell down and Mrs\nBadcock picked her up and took her into her house.",
    "Do you think\nArthur and Mrs Bain will make a match of it\n\n\fJim frowned as he picked up a bit of stratocruiser and consulted\nthe instructional diagram.",
    "I do wish youd listen when Im talking said Cherry.",
    "What did you say\n\nArthur Badcock and Mary Bain.",
    "For the Lords sake Cherry his wifes only just dead You women\nIve heard hes in a terrible state of nerves still  jumps if you speak\nto him.",
    "I wonder why...",
    "I shouldnt have thought hed take it that way\nwould you\n\nCan you clear off this end of the table a bit said Jim relinquishing\neven a passing interest in the affairs of his neighbours.",
    "Just so that\nI can spread some of these pieces out a bit.",
    "Cherry heaved an exasperated sigh.",
    "To get any attention round here you have to be a super jet or a\nturbo prop she said bitterly.",
    "You and your construction models\n\nShe piled the tray with the remains of supper and carried it over to\nthe sink.",
    "She decided not to wash up a necessity of dally life she\nalways put off as long as possible.",
    "Instead she piled everything\n\n\finto the sink haphazard slipped on a corduroy jacket and went out\nof the house pausing to call over her shoulder\n\nIm just going to slip along to see Gladys Dixon.",
    "I want to borrow\none of her Vogue patterns.",
    "All right old girl.",
    "Jim bent over his model.",
    "Casting a venomous look at her nextdoor neighbours front door as\nshe passed Cherry went round the corner into Blenheim Close and\nstopped at No.",
    "16.",
    "The door was open and Cherry tapped on it and\nwent into the hall calling out\n\nIs Gladdy about\n\nIs that you Cherry Mrs Dixon looked out of the kitchen.",
    "Shes\nupstairs in her room dressmaking.",
    "Right.",
    "Ill go up.",
    "Cherry went upstairs to a small bedroom in which Gladys a plump\ngirl with a plain face was kneeling on the floor her cheeks flushed\nand several pins in her mouth tacking up a paper pattern.",
    "Hallo Cherry.",
    "Look I got a lovely bit of stuff at Harpers sale at\nMuch Benham.",
    "Im going to do that crossover pattern with frills\nagain the one I did in Terylene before.",
    "Thatll be nice said Cherry.",
    "Gladys rose to her feet panting a little.",
    "Got indigestion now she said.",
    "You oughtnt to do dressmaking right after supper said Cherry\nbending over like that.",
    "I suppose I ought to slim a bit said Gladys.",
    "She sat down on the\nbed.",
    "Any news from the studios asked Cherry always avid for film\nnews.",
    "Nothing much.",
    "Theres a lot of talk still.",
    "Marina Gregg came back\non the set yesterday  and she created something frightful.",
    "What about\n\nShe didnt like the taste of her coffee.",
    "You know they have coffee\nin the middle of the morning.",
    "She took one sip and said there was\nsomething wrong with it.",
    "Which was nonsense of course.",
    "There\ncouldnt have been.",
    "It comes in a jug straight from the canteen.",
    "Of\ncourse I always put hers in a special china cup rather posh different from the others  but its the same coffee.",
    "So there couldnt\nhave been anything wrong with it could there\n\nNerves I suppose said Cherry.",
    "What happened\n\nOh nothing.",
    "Mr Rudd just calmed everyone down.",
    "Hes wonderful\nthat way.",
    "He took the coffee from her and poured it down the sink.",
    "That seems to be rather stupid said Cherry slowly.",
    "Why  what do you mean\n\nWell if there was anything wrong with it  now nobody will ever\nknow.",
    "Do you think there really might have been asked Gladys looking\nalarmed.",
    "Well  Cherry shrugged her shoulders  there was something\nwrong with her cocktail the day of the f\u043ate wasnt there so why not\nthe coffee If at first you dont succeed try try try again.",
    "Gladys shivered.",
    "I dont half like it Cherry she said.",
    "Somebodys got it in for her all\nright.",
    "Shes had more letters you know threatening her  and there\nwas that bust business the other day.",
    "What bust business\n\nA marble bust.",
    "On the set.",
    "Its a corner of a room in some Austrian\npalace or other.",
    "Funny name like Shotbrown.",
    "Pictures and china\nand marble busts.",
    "This one was up on a bracket  suppose it hadnt\nbeen pushed back enough.",
    "Anyway a heavy lorry went past out in\nthe road and jarred it off  right on to the chair where Marina sits for\nher big scene with Count Somebodyorother.",
    "Smashed to\nsmithereens Lucky they werent shooting at the time.",
    "Mr Rudd he\n\n\fsaid not to say a word to her and he put another chair there and\nwhen she came yesterday and asked why the chair had been\nchanged he said the other chair was the wrong period and this\ngave a better angle for the camera.",
    "But he didnt half like it  I can\ntell you that.",
    "The two girls looked at each other.",
    "Its exciting in a way said Cherry slowly.",
    "And yet  it isnt...",
    "I think Im going to give up working in the canteen at the studios\nsaid Gladys.",
    "Why Nobody wants to poison you or drop marble busts on your\nhead\n\nNo.",
    "But its not always the person whos meant to get done in who\ngets done in.",
    "It may be someone else.",
    "Like Heather Badcock that\nday.",
    "True enough said Cherry.",
    "You know said Gladys Ive been thinking.",
    "I was at the Hall that\nday helping.",
    "I was quite close to them at the time.",
    "When Heather died\n\nNo when she spilt the cocktail.",
    "All down her dress.",
    "A lovely dress\nit was too royal blue nylon taffeta.",
    "Shed got it quite new for the\noccasion.",
    "And it was funny.",
    "What was funny\n\nI didnt think anything of it at the time.",
    "But it does seem funny when\nI think it over.",
    "Cherry looked at her expectantly.",
    "She accepted the adjective\nfunny in the sense that it was meant.",
    "It was not intended\nhumorously.",
    "For goodness sake what was funny she demanded.",
    "Im almost sure she did it on purpose.",
    "Spilt the cocktail on purpose\n\nYes.",
    "And I do think that was funny dont you\n\nOn a brand new dress I dont believe it.",
    "I wonder now said Gladys what Arthur Badcock will do with all\nHeathers clothes.",
    "That dress would clean all right.",
    "Or I could take\nout half a breadth its a lovely full skirt.",
    "Do you think Arthur\nBadcock would think it very awful of me if I wanted to buy it off him\nIt would need hardly any alteration  and its lovely stuff.",
    "You wouldnt  Cherry hesitated  mind\n\nMind what\n\n\fWell  having a dress that a woman had died in  I mean died that\nway...\n\nGladys stared at her.",
    "I hadnt thought of that she admitted.",
    "She considered for a\nmoment or two.",
    "Then she cheered up.",
    "I cant see that it really matters she said.",
    "After all every time you\nbuy something secondhand somebodys usually worn it who has\ndied havent they\n\nYes.",
    "But its not quite the same.",
    "I think youre being fanciful said Gladys.",
    "Its a lovely bright shade\nof blue and really expensive stuff.",
    "About that funny business she\ncontinued thoughtfully I think Ill go up to the hall tomorrow\nmorning on my way to work and have a word with Mr Giuseppe\nabout it.",
    "Is he the Italian butler\n\nYes.",
    "Hes awfully handsome.",
    "Flashing eyes.",
    "Hes got a terrible\ntemper.",
    "When we go and help there he chivvies us girls something\nterrible.",
    "She giggled.",
    "But none of us really mind.",
    "He can be awfully\nnice sometimes...",
    "Anyway I might just tell him about it and ask him\nwhat I ought to do.",
    "I dont see that youve got anything to tell said Cherry.",
    "Well it was funny said Gladys defiantly clinging to her favourite\nadjective.",
    "I think said Cherry that you just want an excuse to go and talk to\nMr Giuseppe  and youd better be careful my girl.",
    "You know what\nthese wops are like Affiliation orders all over the place.",
    "Hotblooded and passionate thats what these Italians are.",
    "Gladys sighed ecstatically.",
    "Cherry looked at her friends fat slightly spotted face and decided\nthat her warnings were unnecessary.",
    "Mr Giuseppe she thought\nwould have better fish to fry elsewhere.",
    "II\n\nAha said Dr Haydock unravelling I see.",
    "He looked from Miss Marple to a pile of fluffy white fleecy wool.",
    "You advised me to try unravelling if I couldnt knit said Miss\nMarple.",
    "You seem to have been very thorough about it.",
    "I made a mistake in the pattern right at the beginning.",
    "That made\nthe whole thing go out of proportion so Ive had to unravel it all.",
    "Its\na very elaborate pattern you see.",
    "What are elaborate patterns to you Nothing at all.",
    "I ought really I suppose with my bad eyesight to stick to plain\nknitting.",
    "Youd find that very boring.",
    "Well Im flattered that you took my\nadvice.",
    "Dont I always take your advice Doctor Haydock\n\nYou do when it suits you said Dr Haydock.",
    "Tell me Doctor was it really knitting you had in mind when you\ngave me that advice\n\nHe met the twinkle in her eyes and twinkled back at her.",
    "How are you getting on with unravelling the murder he asked.",
    "Im afraid my faculties arent quite what they were said Miss\nMarple shaking her head with a sigh.",
    "Nonsense said Dr Haydock.",
    "Dont tell me you havent formed\nsome conclusions.",
    "Of course I have formed conclusions.",
    "Very definite ones.",
    "Such as asked Haydock inquiringly.",
    "If the cocktail glass was tampered with that day  and I dont see\nquite how that could have been done \n\nMight have had the stuff ready in an eyedropper suggested\nHaydock.",
    "You are so professional said Miss Marple admiringly.",
    "But even\nthen it seems to me so very peculiar that nobody saw it happen.",
    "Murder should not only be done but be seen done Is that it\n\nYou know exactly what I mean said Miss Marple.",
    "That was a chance the murderer had to take said Haydock.",
    "Oh quite so.",
    "Im not disputing that for a moment.",
    "But there were I\nhave found by inquiry and adding up the persons at least eighteen\nto twenty people on the spot.",
    "It seems to me that amongst twenty\npeople somebody must have seen that action occur.",
    "Haydock nodded.",
    "One would think so certainly.",
    "But obviously no\none did.",
    "I wonder said Miss Marple thoughtfully.",
    "What have you got in mind exactly\n\nWell there are three possibilities.",
    "Im assuming that at least one\nperson would have seen something.",
    "One out of twenty.",
    "I think its\nonly reasonable to assume that.",
    "I think youre begging the question said Haydock and I can see\nlooming ahead one of those terrible exercises in probability where\nsix men have white hats and six men have black and you have to\nwork it out by mathematics how likely it is that the hats will get\nmixed up and in what proportion.",
    "If you start thinking about things\nlike that you would go round the bend.",
    "Let me assure you of that\n\nI wasnt thinking of anything like that said Miss Marple.",
    "I was just\nthinking of what is likely \n\nYes said Haydock thoughtfully youre very good at that.",
    "You\nalways have been.",
    "It is likely you know said Miss Marple that out of twenty people\none at least should be an observant one.",
    "I give in said Haydock.",
    "Lets have the three possibilities.",
    "Im afraid Ill have to put them in rather sketchily said Miss Marple.",
    "I havent quite thought it out.",
    "Inspector Craddock and probably\nFrank Cornish before him will have questioned everybody who was\nthere so the natural thing would be that whoever saw anything of\nthe kind would have said so at once.",
    "Is that one of the possibilities\n\nNo of course it isnt said Miss Marple because it hasnt\nhappened.",
    "What you have to account for is if one person did see\nsomething why didnt that person say so\n\n\fIm listening.",
    "Possibility One said Miss Marple her cheeks going pink with\nanimation.",
    "The person who saw it didnt realise what they had\nseen.",
    "That would mean of course that it would have to be rather a\nstupid person.",
    "Someone let us say who can use their eyes but not\ntheir brain.",
    "The sort of person who if you asked them.",
    "Did you see\nanyone put anything in Marina Greggs glass would answer Oh\nno but if you said Did you see anyone put their hand over the top\nof Marina Greggs glass would say Oh yes of course I did.",
    "Haydock laughed.",
    "I admit he said that one never quite allows for\nthe moron in our midst.",
    "All right I grant you Possibility One.",
    "The\nmoron saw it the moron didnt grasp what the action meant.",
    "And\nthe second possibility\n\nThis ones farfetched but I do think its just a possibility.",
    "It might\nhave been a person whose action in putting something in a glass\nwas natural.",
    "Wait wait explain that a little more clearly.",
    "It seems to me nowadays said Miss Marple that people are\nalways adding things to what they eat and drink.",
    "In my young days\nit was considered to be very bad manners to take medicines with\nones meals.",
    "It was on a par with blowing your nose at the dinner\ntable.",
    "It just wasnt done.",
    "If you had to take pills or capsules or a\nspoonful of something you went out of the room to do so.",
    "Thats not\nthe case now.",
    "When staying with my nephew Raymond I observed\n\n\fsome of his guests seemed to arrive with quite a quantity of little\nbottles of pills and tablets.",
    "They take them with food or before\nfood or after food.",
    "They keep aspirins and such things in their\nhandbags and take them the whole time  with cups of tea or with\ntheir afterdinner coffee.",
    "You understand what I mean\n\nOh yes said Dr Haydock Ive got your meaning now and its\ninteresting.",
    "You mean that someone  he stopped.",
    "Lets have it in\nyour own words.",
    "I meant said Miss Marple that it would be quite possible\naudacious but possible for someone to pick up that glass which as\nsoon as it was in his or her hand of course would be assumed to\nbe his or her own drink and to add whatever was added quite\nopenly.",
    "In that case you see people wouldnt think twice of it.",
    "He  or she  couldnt be sure of that though Haydock pointed out.",
    "No agreed Miss Marple it would be a gamble a risk  but it could\nhappen.",
    "And then she went on theres the third possibility.",
    "Possibility One a moron said the doctor.",
    "Possibility Two a\ngambler  whats Possibility Three\n\nSomebody saw what happened and has held their tongue\ndeliberately.",
    "Haydock frowned.",
    "For what reason he asked.",
    "Are you\nsuggesting blackmail If so \n\n\fIf so said Miss Marple its a very dangerous thing to do.",
    "Yes indeed.",
    "He looked sharply at the placid old lady with the white\nfleecy garment on her lap.",
    "Is the third possibility the one you\nconsider the most probable one\n\nNo said Miss Marple I wouldnt go so far as that.",
    "I have at the\nmoment insufficient grounds.",
    "Unless she added carefully\nsomeone else gets killed.",
    "Do you think someone else is going to get killed\n\nI hope not said Miss Marple I trust and pray not.",
    "But it so often\nhappens Doctor Haydock.",
    "Thats the sad and frightening thing.",
    "It\nso often happens.",
    "Chapter 17\n\nElla put down the telephone receiver smiled m herself and came\nout of the public telephone box.",
    "She was pleased with herself.",
    "ChiefInspector God Almighty Craddock she said to herself.",
    "Im\ntwice as good as he is at the job.",
    "Variations on the theme off Fly\nall is discovered\n\nShe pictured to herself with a good deal of pleasure the reactions\nrecently suffered by the person at the other end of the line.",
    "That\nfaint menacing whisper coming through the receiver.",
    "I saw you...\n\n\fShe laughed silently the corners of her mouth curving up in a feline\ncruel line.",
    "A student of psychology might have watched her with\nsome interest.",
    "Never until the last few days had she had this feeling\nof power.",
    "She was hardly aware herself of how much the heady\nintoxication of it affected her...\n\nShe passed the East Lodge and Mrs Bantry busy as usual in the\ngarden waved a hand to her.",
    "Damn that old woman thought Ella.",
    "She could feel Mrs Bantrys\neyes following her as she walked up the drive.",
    "A phrase came into her head for no particular reason.",
    "The pitcher\ngoes to the well once too often...",
    "Nonsense.",
    "Nobody could suspect that it was she who had\nwhispered those menacing words...\n\nShe sneezed.",
    "Damn this hayfever said Ella Zielinsky.",
    "When she came into her office Jason Rudd was standing by the\nwindow.",
    "He wheeled round.",
    "I couldnt think where you were.",
    "I had to go and speak to the gardener.",
    "There were  she broke off\nas she caught sight of his face.",
    "She asked sharply What is it\n\nHis eyes seemed set deeper in his face than ever.",
    "All the gaiety of\nthe clown was gone.",
    "This was a man under strain.",
    "She had seen\nhim under strain before but never looking like this.",
    "She said again What is it\n\nHe held a sheet of paper out to her.",
    "Its the analysis of that coffee.",
    "The coffee that Marina complained about and wouldnt drink.",
    "You sent it to be analysed She was startled.",
    "But you poured it\naway down the sink.",
    "I saw you.",
    "His wide mouth curled up in a smile.",
    "Im pretty good at sleight of\nhand Ella he said.",
    "You didnt know that did you Yes I poured\nmost of it away but I kept a little and I took it along to be analysed.",
    "She looked down at the paper in her hand.",
    "Arsenic.",
    "She sounded incredulous.",
    "Yes arsenic.",
    "So Marina was right about it tasting bitter\n\n\fShe wasnt right about that.",
    "Arsenic has no taste.",
    "But her instinct\nwas quite right.",
    "And we thought she was just being hysterical\n\nShe is hysterical Who wouldnt be She has a woman drop dead at\nher feet practically.",
    "She gets threatening notes  one after another theres not been anything today has there\n\nElla shook her head.",
    "Who plants the damned things Oh well I suppose its easy enough\n all these open windows.",
    "Anyone could slip in.",
    "You mean we ought to keep the house barred and locked But its\nsuch hot weather.",
    "Theres a man posted in the grounds after all.",
    "Yes and I dont want to frighten her more than shes frightened\nalready.",
    "Threatening notes dont matter two hoots.",
    "But arsenic\nElla arsenics different...\n\nNobody could tamper with food here in the house.",
    "Couldnt they Ella Couldnt they\n\nNot without being seen.",
    "No unauthorized person \n\nHe interrupted.",
    "People will do things for money Ella.",
    "Hardly murder\n\nEven that.",
    "And they mightnt realize it was murder...",
    "The\nservants...\n\nIm sure the servants are all right.",
    "Giuseppe now.",
    "I doubt if Id trust Giuseppe very far if it came to the\nquestion of money... Hes been with us some time of course but \n\nMust you torture yourself like this Jason\n\nHe flung himself down in the chair.",
    "He leaned forward his long\narms hanging down between his knees.",
    "What to do he said slowly and softly.",
    "My God what to do\n\nElla did not speak.",
    "She sat there watching him.",
    "She was happy here said Jason.",
    "He was speaking more to himself\nthan to Ella.",
    "He stared down between his knees at the carpet.",
    "If he\nhad looked up the expression on her face might perhaps have\nsurprised him.",
    "She was happy he said again.",
    "She hoped to be happy and she\nwas happy.",
    "She was saying so that day the day Mrs Whatshername\n\nBantry\n\n\fYes.",
    "The day Mrs Bantry came to tea.",
    "She said it was so\npeaceful.",
    "She said that at last shed found a place where she could\nsettle down and be happy and feel secure.",
    "My goodness secure\n\nHappy ever after Ellas voice held a slight tone of irony.",
    "Yes put\nlike that it sounds just like a fairy story.",
    "At any rate she believed it.",
    "But you didnt said Ella.",
    "You never thought it would be like that\n\nJason Rudd smiled.",
    "No.",
    "I didnt go the whole hog.",
    "But I did think\nthat for a while a year  two years  there might be a period of calm\nand content.",
    "It might have made a new woman of her.",
    "It might have\ngiven her confidence in herself.",
    "She can be happy you know.",
    "When\nshe is happy shes like a child.",
    "Just like a child.",
    "And now  this had\nto happen to her.",
    "Ella moved restlessly.",
    "Things have to happen to all of us she said\nbrusquely.",
    "Thats the way life is.",
    "You just have to take it.",
    "Some of us\ncan some of us cant.",
    "Shes the kind that cant.",
    "She sneezed.",
    "Your hayfever bad again\n\nYes.",
    "By the way Giuseppes gone to London.",
    "Jason looked faintly surprised.",
    "To London Why\n\nSome kind of family trouble.",
    "Hes got relations in Soho and one of\nthems desperately ill.",
    "He went to Marina about it and she said it\nwas all right so I gave him the day off.",
    "Hell be back sometime\ntonight.",
    "You dont mind do you\n\nNo said Jason I dont mind...",
    "He got up and walked up and down.",
    "If I could take her away... now... at once.",
    "Scrap the picture But just think.",
    "His voice rose.",
    "I cant think of anything but Marina.",
    "Dont you understand Shes in\ndanger.",
    "Thats all I can think about.",
    "She opened her mouth impulsively then closed it.",
    "She gave another muffled sneeze and rose.",
    "Id better get my atomizer.",
    "She left the room and went to her bedroom a word echoing in her\nmind.",
    "Marina... Marina... Marina...",
    "Always Marina...\n\nFury rose up in her.",
    "She stilled it.",
    "She went into the bathroom and\npicked up the spray she used.",
    "She inserted the nozzle into one nostril and squeezed.",
    "The warning came a second too late...",
    "Her brain recognized the\nunfamiliar odour of bitter almonds... but not in time to paralyse the\nsqueezing fingers...\n\nChapter 18\n\nFrank Cornish replaced the receiver.",
    "Miss Brewster is out of London for the day he announced.",
    "Is she now said Craddock.",
    "Do you think she \n\nI dont know.",
    "I shouldnt think so but I dont know.",
    "Ardwyck Fenn\n\nOut.",
    "I left word for him to ring you.",
    "And Margot Bence Personality\nPhotographer has got an assignment somewhere in the country.",
    "Her pansy partner didnt know where  or said he didnt.",
    "And the\nbutlers hooked it to London.",
    "I wonder said Craddock thoughtfully if the butler has hooked it\nfor good.",
    "I always suspect dying relatives.",
    "Why was he suddenly\nanxious to go to London today\n\nHe could have put the cyanide in the atomizer easily enough before\nhe left.",
    "Anybody could.",
    "But I think hes indicated.",
    "It could hardly be someone from outside.",
    "Oh yes it could.",
    "Youd have to judge your moment.",
    "You could\nleave a car in one of the side drives wait until everyone is in the\ndiningroom say and slip in through a window and upstairs.",
    "The\nshrubberies come close up to the house.",
    "Damn risky.",
    "This murderer doesnt mind taking risks you know.",
    "Thats been\napparent all along.",
    "Weve had a man on duty in the grounds.",
    "I know.",
    "One man wasnt enough.",
    "So long as it was a question of\nthese anonymous letters I didnt feel so much urgency.",

    "Prussic acid had been put in an atomizer she was\nin the habit of using.",
    "I see.",
    "Yes I see...",
    "There was a short pause.",
    "And why may I ask\nshould you ring me about this distressing occurrence\n\nYou knew Miss Zielinsky Mr Fenn\n\nCertainly I knew her.",
    "I have known her for some years.",
    "But she was\nnot an intimate friend.",
    "We hoped that you could perhaps assist us\n\nIn what way\n\nWe wondered if you could suggest any motive for her death.",
    "She is\na stranger in this country.",
    "We know very little about her friends and\nassociates and the circumstances of her life.",
    "I would suggest that Jason Rudd is the person to question about\nthat.",
    "Naturally.",
    "We have done so.",
    "But there might be an offchance that\nyou might know something about her that he does not.",
    "Im afraid that is not so.",
    "I know next to nothing about Ella Zielinsky\nexcept that she was a most capable young woman and firstclass\nat her job.",
    "About her private life I know nothing at all.",
    "So you have no suggestions to make\n\nCraddock was ready for the decisive negative but to his surprise it\ndid not come.",
    "Instead there was a pause.",
    "He could hear Ardwyck\nFern breathing rather heavily at the other end.",
    "Are you still there ChiefInspector\n\nYes Mr Fenn.",
    "Im here.",
    "I have decided to tell you something that may be of assistance to\nyou.",
    "When you hear what it is you will realize that I have every\nreason to keep it to myself.",
    "But I judge that in the end that might be\nunwise.",
    "The facts are these.",
    "A couple of days ago I received a\ntelephone call.",
    "A voice spoke to me in a whisper.",
    "It said  I am\nquoting now  I saw you...",
    "I saw you put the tablets in the glass...\nYou didnt know there had been an eyewitness did you Thats all\nfor now  very soon you will be told what you have to do.",
    "Craddock uttered an ejaculation of astonishment.",
    "Surprising was it not Mr Craddock I will assure you categorically\nthat the accusation was entirely unfounded.",
    "I did not put tablets in\nanybodys glass.",
    "I defy anyone to prove that I did.",
    "The suggestion is\nutterly absurd.",
    "But it would seem would it not that Miss Zielinsky\nwas embarking on blackmail.",
    "You recognized her voice\n\nYou cannot recognize a whisper.",
    "But it was Ella Zielinsky all right.",
    "How do you know\n\nThe whisperer sneezed heavily before ringing off.",
    "I knew that Miss\nZielinsky suffered from hay fever.",
    "And you think  what\n\nI think that Miss Zielinsky got hold of the wrong person at her first\nattempt.",

    "It could be.",
    "Hes the kind of\nman who has the nerve for it.",
    "If theres the least chance that Ella\nZielinsky left a record of her suspicions then this taking of the bull\nby the horns is a magnificent bluff.",
    "And his alibi\n\nWeve come across some very good faked alibis in our time said\nCraddock.",
    "He could afford to pay a good sum for one.",
    "II\n\nIt was past midnight when Giuseppe returned to Gossington.",
    "He\ntook a taxi from Much Benham as the last train on the branch line\nto St Mary Mead had gone.",

    "I never repeat anything myself.",
    "Very careful I\nam.",
    "You were saying said Miss Marple that something rather terrible\nhad happened\n\nIt really quite bowled me over said Miss Knight.",
    "Are you sure you\ndont feel the draught from that window dear\n\nI like a little fresh air said Miss Marple.",
    "Ah but we mustnt catch cold must we said Miss Knight archly.",

    "Well you mustnt worry about it said Miss Knight and you mustnt\nlet it make you nervous in any way because Im sure its nothing to\n\n\fdo with us.",
    "But with all these American gangsters and things like\nthat well I suppose its nothing to be surprised about.",
    "Somebody else has been killed said Miss Marple is that it\n\nOh thats very sharp of you dear.",
    "I dont know what should put\nsuch a thing into your head.",

    "Who is it whos dead\n\nThe Italian butler.",
    "He was shot last night.",
    "I see said Miss Marple thoughtfully.",
    "Yes very likely of course but\nI should have thought that hed have realized before now the\nimportance of what he saw \n\nReally exclaimed Miss Knight you talk as though you knew all\nabout it.",
    "Why should he have been killed\n\nI expect said Miss Marple thoughtfully that he tried to blackmail\nsomebody.",
    "He went to London yesterday they say.",
    "Did he now said Miss Marple thats very interesting and\nsuggestive too I think.",
    "Miss Knight departed to the kitchen intent on the concoction of\nnourishing beverages.",
    "Miss Marple remained sitting thoughtfully till\ndisturbed by the loud aggressive humming of the vacuum cleaner\nassisted by Cherrys voice singing the latest favourite ditty of the\nmoment I Said To You and You Said To Me.",
    "Miss Knight popped her head round the kitchen door.",
    "Not quite so much noise please Cherry she said.",
    "You dont want\nto disturb Miss Marple do you You mustnt be thoughtless you\nknow.",
    "She shut the kitchen door again as Cherry remarked either to\nherself or the world at large And who said you could call me\nCherry you old jellybag The vacuum continued to whine while\nCherry sang in a more subdued voice.",
    "Miss Marple called in a high\nclear voice\n\nCherry come here a minute.",
    "Cherry switched off the vacuum and opened the drawingroom\ndoor.",
    "I didnt mean to disturb you by singing Miss Marple.",
    "Your singing is much pleasanter than the horrid noise that vacuum\nmakes said Miss Marple but I know one has to go with the times.",
    "It would be no use on earth asking any of you young people to use\nthe dustpan and brush in the oldfashioned way.",
    "What get down on my knees with a dustpan and brush Cherry\nregistered alarm and surprise.",

    "I called you because I wanted to talk to you.",
    "Cherry obeyed and came towards Miss Marple looking inquiringly\nat her.",
    "Weve not much time said Miss Marple.",
    "That old  Miss Knight I\nmean  will come in any moment with an egg drink of some kind.",
    "Good for you I expect.",

    "Yes.",
    "His name is Giuseppe I understand.",
    "No said Cherry I hadnt heard that.",
    "I heard that Mr Rudds\nsecretary had a heart attack yesterday and somebody said she\nwas actually dead  but I suspect that was just a rumour.",
    "Who told\nyou about the butler\n\n\fMiss Knight came back and told me.",
    "Of course I havent seen anyone to speak to this morning said\nCherry not before coming along here.",
    "I expect the news has only\njust got round.",
    "Was he bumped off she demanded.",
    "That seems to be assumed said Miss Marple whether rightly or\nwrongly I dont quite know.",
    "This is a wonderful place for talk said Cherry.",
    "I wonder if Gladys\ngot to see him or not she added thoughtfully.",
    "Gladys\n\nOh a sort of friend of mine.",
    "She lives a few doors away.",
    "Works in\nthe canteen at the studios.",
    "And she talked to you about Giuseppe\n\nWell there was something that struck her as a bit funny and she\nwas going to ask him what he thought about it.",
    "But if you ask me it\nwas just an excuse  shes a bit sweet on him.",
    "Of course hes quite\nhandsome and Italians do have a way with them  I told her to be\ncareful about him though.",
    "You know what Italians are.",
    "He went to London yesterday said Miss Marple and only returned\nin the evening I understand.",
    "I wonder if she managed to get to see him before he went.",
    "Why did she want to see him Cherry\n\nIt was just something which she felt was a bit funny said Cherry.",
    "Miss Marple looked at her inquiringly.",
    "She was able to take the\nword funny at the valuation it usually had for the Gladyses of the\nneighbourhood.",
    "She was one of the girls who helped at the party there explained\nCherry.",
    "The day of the f\u043ate.",
    "You know when Mrs Badcock got\nhers.",
    "Yes Miss Marple was looking more alert than ever much as a fox\nterrier might look at a waiting rathole.",
    "And there was something that she saw that struck her as a bit\nfunny.",
    "Why didnt she go to the police about it\n\nWell she didnt really think it meant anything you see explained\nCherry.",
    "Anyway she thought shed better ask Mr Giuseppe first.",
    "What was it that she saw that day\n\nFrankly said Cherry what she told me seemed nonsense Ive\nwondered perhaps if she was just putting me off  and what she\nwas going to see Mr Giuseppe about was something quite\ndifferent.",
    "What did she say Miss Marple was patient and pursuing.",
    "Cherry frowned.",
    "She was talking about Mrs Badcock and the\ncocktail and she said she was quite near her at the time.",
    "And she\nsaid she did it herself.",
    "Did what herself\n\nSpilt her cocktail all down her dress and ruined it.",
    "You mean it was clumsiness\n\nNo not clumsiness.",
    "Gladys said she did it on purpose  that she\nmeant to do it.",
    "Well I mean that doesnt make sense does it\nhowever you look at it\n\nMiss Marple shook her head perplexed.",
    "No she said.",
    "Certainly\nnot  no I cant see any sense in that.",
    "Shed got on a new dress too said Cherry.",
    "Thats how the subject\ncame up.",
    "Gladys wondered whether shed be able to buy it.",
    "Said it\nought to clean all right but she didnt like to go and ask Mr Badcock\nherself.",
    "Shes very good at dressmaking Gladys is and she said it\nwas lovely stuff.",
    "Royal blue taffeta and she said even if the stuff\nwas ruined where the cocktail stained it she could take out a seam\n half a breadth say  because it was one of those full skirts.",
    "Miss Marple considered this dressmaking problem for a moment\nand then set it aside.",
    "But you think your friend Gladys might have been keeping\nsomething back\n\nWell I just wondered because I dont see if thats all she saw Heather Badcock deliberately spilling her cocktail over herself  I\ndont see that thered be anything to ask Mr Giuseppe about do\nyou\n\nNo I dont said Miss Marple.",
    "She sighed.",
    "But its always\ninteresting when one doesnt see she added.",
    "If you dont see what\na thing means you must be looking at it wrong way round unless of\ncourse you havent got full information.",
    "Which is probably the case\nhere.",
    "She sighed.",
    "Its a pity she didnt go straight to the police.",
    "The door opened and Miss Knight bustled in holding a tall tumbler\nwith a delicious pale yellow froth on top.",
    "Now here you are dear she said a nice little treat.",
    "Were going to\nenjoy this.",
    "She pulled forward a little table and placed it beside her employer.",

    "I nearly fell\nover it.",
    "Anyone might have an accident.",
    "Rightho said Cherry.",
    "Id better get on with things.",
    "She left the room.",
    "Really said Miss Knight that Mrs Baker Im continually having to\nspeak to her about something or other.",
    "Leaving vacuum cleaners\nall over the place and coming in here chattering to you when you\nwant to be quiet.",
    "I called her in said Miss Marple.",
    "I wanted to speak to her.",
    "Well I hope you mentioned the way the beds are made said Miss\nKnight.",
    "I was quite shocked when I came to turn down your bed\nlast night.",
    "I had to make it all over again.",
    "That was very kind of you said Miss Marple.",
    "Oh I never grudge being helpful said Miss Knight.",
    "Thats why Im\nhere isnt it.",
    "To make a certain person we know as comfortable and\nhappy as possible.",
    "Oh dear dear she added youve pulled out a\nlot of your knitting again.",
    "Miss Marple leaned back and closed her eyes.",
    "Im going to have a\nlittle rest she said.",
    "Put the glass here  thank you.",
    "And please\ndont come in and disturb me for at least threequarters of an hour.",
    "Indeed I wont dear said Miss Knight.",
    "And Ill tell that Mrs Baker\nto be very quiet.",
    "She bustled out purposefully.",
    "II\n\n\fThe goodlooking young American glanced round him in a puzzled\nway.",
    "The ramifications of the housing estate perplexed him.",
    "He addressed himself politely to an old lady with white hair and pink\ncheeks who seemed to be the only human being in sight.",
    "Excuse me mam but could you tell me where to find Blenheim\nClose\n\nThe old lady considered him for a moment.",
    "He had just begun to\nwonder if she was deaf and had prepared himself to repeat his\ndemand in a louder voice when she spoke.",
    "Along here to the right then turn left second to the right again\nand straight on.",
    "What number do you want\n\nNo.",
    "16.",
    "He consulted a small piece of paper.",

    "I want\nto get hold of her to come up to Gossington Hall.",
    "Were very\nshorthanded there today.",
    "Of course said the old lady.",
    "The butler was shot last night wasnt\nhe\n\nThe young man was slightly staggered by this reply.",
    "I guess news gets round pretty quickly in these parts he said.",
    "It does indeed said the old lady.",
    "Mr Rudds secretary died of\nsome kind of seizure yesterday too I understand.",
    "She shook her\nhead.",
    "Terrible.",
    "Quite terrible.",
    "What are we coming to\n\nChapter 20\n\nA little later in the day yet another visitor found his way to 16\nBlenheim Close.",
    "DetectiveSergeant William Tom Tiddler.",
    "In reply to his sharp knock on the smart yellow painted door it was\nopened to him by a girl of about fifteen.",

    "Havent got an address she\nsaid.",
    "Gladys said shed send us her address as soon as she knew\nwhere she was going to stay.",
    "As like as not she wont though she\nadded.",
    "Last summer she went to Torquay and never sent us as\nmuch as a postcard.",
    "Shes slack that way and besides she says\nwhy do mothers have to bother all the time\n\nDid somebody stand her this holiday\n\nMust have said the girl.",
    "Shes pretty hard up at the moment.",

    "She pays for herself.",
    "So\ndont you get ideas mister.",
    "Tiddler said meekly that he wouldnt get ideas but he would like the\naddress if Gladys Dixon should send a postcard.",
    "He returned to the station with the result of his various inquiries.",

    "Yes said Craddock.",
    "It seemed plain there was more to come.",
    "But word went round as Mr Rudd didnt throw it all away.",
    "He kept\nsome and had it analysed and it was poison.",
    "It sounds to me said Craddock very unlikely.",
    "Ill have to ask him\nabout that.",
    "II\n\nJason Rudd was nervous irritable.",
    "Surely Inspector Craddock he said I was only doing what I had a\nperfect right to do.",
    "If you suspected anything was wrong with that coffee Mr Rudd it\nwould have been much better if youd turned it over to us.",
    "The truth of it is that I didnt suspect for a moment that anything\nwas wrong with it.",
    "In spite of your wife saying that it tasted odd\n\nOh that A faintly rueful smile came to Rudds face.",
    "Ever since the\ndate of the f\u043ate everything that my wife has eaten or drunk has\ntasted odd.",

    "The other one was\nslipped in the letterbox.",

    "Craddocks eyebrows rose.",
    "Very childish he said.",
    "Meaning you discount them as dangerous\n\nNot at all said Craddock.",
    "A murderers mind usually is childish.",
    "Youve really no idea at all Mr Rudd who sent these\n\nNot the least said Jason.",
    "I cant help feeling its more like a\nmacabre joke than anything else.",
    "It seemed to me perhaps  he\nhesitated.",
    "Yes Mr Rudd\n\n\fIt could be somebody local perhaps who  who had been excited\nby the poisoning on the day of the f\u043ate.",
    "Someone perhaps who has\na grudge against the acting profession.",
    "There are rural pockets\nwhere acting is considered to be one of the devils weapons.",
    "Meaning that you think Miss Gregg is not actually threatened But\nwhat about this business of the coffee\n\nI dont even know how you got to hear about that said Rudd with\nsome annoyance.",
    "Craddock shook his head.",
    "Everyones talked about that.",
    "It always comes to ones ears Sooner\nor later.",
    "But you should have come to us.",
    "Even when you got the\nresult of the analysis you didnt let us know did you\n\nNo said Jason.",

    "But now \n\nYou thought it was Ella Jason sounded astonished.",
    "But why\n\n\fBecause she hated me  oh yes she did.",
    "Dont men ever see these\nthings She was madly in love with you.",
    "I dont believe you had the\nleast idea of it.",
    "But it cant be Ella because Ellas dead.",
    "Oh Jinks\nJinks  do help me  get me away from here  let me go somewhere\nsafe... safe...\n\nShe sprang up and walked rapidly up and down turning and\ntwisting her hands.",
    "The director in Jason was full of admiration for those passionate\ntortured movements.",
    "I must remember them he thought.",

    "I hate his house\n hate it.",
    "Listen we cant go away immediately.",
    "Why not Why not\n\nBecause said Rudd deaths cause complications... and theres\nsomething else to consider.",
    "Will running away do any good\n\nOf course it will.",
    "Well get away from this person who hates me.",
    "If theres anyone who hates you that much they could follow you\neasily enough.",
    "You mean  you mean  I shall never get away I shall never be safe\nagain\n\nDarling  it will be all right.",
    "Ill look after you.",
    "Ill keep you safe.",
    "She clung to him.",
    "Will you Jinks Will you see that nothing happens to me\n\nShe sagged against him and he laid her down gently on the chaiselongue.",
    "Oh Im a coward she murmured a coward... if I knew who it was and why... Get me my pills  the yellow ones not the brown.",
    "I must\nhave something to calm me.",
    "Dont take too many for Gods sake Marina.",
    "All right  all right...",
    "Sometimes they dont have any effect any\nmore... She looked up in his face.",
    "She smiled a tender exquisite smile.",
    "Youll take care of me Jinks Swear youll take care of me \n\nAlways said Jason Rudd.",
    "To the bitter end.",
    "Her eyes opened wide.",
    "You looked so  so odd when you said that.",
    "Did I How did I look\n\nI cant explain.",
    "Like  like a clown laughing at something terribly\nsad that no one else has seen...\n\nChapter 21\n\nIt was a tired and depressed Inspector Craddock who came to see\nMiss Marple the following day.",
    "Sit down and be comfortable she said.",
    "I can see youve had a very\nhard time.",
    "I dont like to be defeated said Inspector Craddock.",
    "Two murders\nwithin twentyfour hours.",
    "Ah well Im poorer at my job than I\nthought I was.",
    "Give me a nice cup of tea Aunt Jane with some thin\nbread and butter and soothe me with your earliest remembrances\nof St Mary Mead.",
    "Miss Marple clicked with her tongue in a sympathetic manner.",
    "Now its no good talking like that my dear boy and I dont think\nbread and butter is after all what you want.",
    "Gentlemen when\ntheyve had a disappointment want something stronger than tea.",
    "As usual Miss Marple said the word gentlemen in the way of\nsomeone describing a foreign species.",
    "I should advise a good stiff whisky and soda she said.",
    "Would you really Aunt Jane Well I wont say no.",
    "And I shall get it for you myself said Miss Marple rising to her feet.",
    "Oh no dont do that.",
    "Let me.",
    "Or what about Miss Whatshername\n\nWe dont want Miss Knight fussing about in here said Miss Marple.",
    "She wont be bringing my tea for another twenty minutes so that\ngives us a little peace and quiet.",
    "Clever of you to come to the\nwindow and not through the front door.",
    "Now we can have a nice\nquiet little time by ourselves.",
    "She went to a corner cupboard opened it and produced a bottle a\nsyphon of soda and a glass.",
    "You are full of surprises said Dermot Craddock.",
    "Id no idea thats\nwhat you kept in your corner cupboard.",
    "Are you quite sure youre\nnot a secret drinker Aunt Jane\n\nNow now Miss Marple admonished him.",
    "I have never been an\nadvocate of teetotalism.",
    "A little strong drink is always advisable on\nthe premises in case there is a shock or an accident.",
    "Invaluable at\nsuch times.",
    "Or of course if a gentleman should arrive suddenly.",
    "There said Miss Marple handing him her remedy with an air of\nquiet triumph.",
    "And you dont need to joke any more.",
    "Just sit quietly\nthere and relax.",
    "Wonderful wives there must have been in your young days said\nDermot Craddock.",
    "Im sure my dear boy you would find the young lady of the type\nyou refer to as a very inadequate helpmeet nowadays.",
    "Young ladies\nwere not encouraged to be intellectual and very few of them had\nuniversity degrees or any kind of academic distinction.",
    "There are things that are preferable to academic distinctions said\nDermot.",
    "One of them is knowing when a man wants whisky and\nsoda and giving it to him.",
    "Miss Marple smiled at him affectionately.",
    "Come she said tell me all about it.",
    "Or as much as you are allowed\nto tell me.",
    "I think you probably know as much as I do.",
    "And very likely you have\nsomething up your sleeve.",
    "How about your dogsbody your dear\nMiss Knight What about her having committed the crime\n\nNow why should Miss Knight have done such a thing demanded\nMiss Marple surprised.",
    "Because shes the most unlikely person said Dermot.",
    "It so often\nseems to hold good when you produce your answer.",
    "Not at all said Miss Marple with spirit.",
    "I have said over and over\nagain not only to you my dear Dermot  if I may call you so  that it\nis always the obvious person who has done the crime.",
    "One thinks\nso often of the wife or the husband and so very often it is the wife or\nthe husband.",
    "Meaning Jason Rudd He shook his head.",
    "That man adores\nMarina Gregg.",
    "I was speaking generally said Miss Marple with dignity.",
    "First we\nhad Mrs Badcock apparently murdered.",
    "One asked oneself who\ncould have done such a thing and the first answer would naturally\nbe the husband.",
    "So one had to examine that possibility.",
    "Then we\ndecided that the real object of the crime was Marina Gregg and\nthere again we have to look for the person most intimately\nconnected with Marina Gregg starting as I say with the husband.",
    "Because there is no doubt about that husbands do very frequently\nwant to make away with their wives though sometimes of course\nthey only wish to make away with their wives and do not actually do\nso.",
    "But I agree with you my dear boy that Jason Rudd really cares\nwith all his heart for Marina Gregg.",
    "It might be very clever acting\nthough I can hardly believe that.",
    "And one certainly cannot see a\nmotive of any kind for his doing away with her.",
    "If he wanted to\nmarry somebody else there could I should say be nothing more\nsimple.",
    "Divorce if I may say so seems second nature to film stars.",
    "A practical advantage does not seem to arise either.",
    "He is not a\npoor man by any means.",
    "He has his own career and is I\nunderstand most successful in it.",
    "So we must go farther afield.",
    "But\nit certainly is difficult.",
    "Yes very difficult.",
    "Yes said Craddock it must hold particular difficulties for you\nbecause of course this film world is entirely new to you.",
    "You dont\nknow the local scandals and all the rest of it.",
    "I know a little more than you may think said Miss Marple.",
    "I have\nstudied very closely various numbers of Confidential Film Life Film\nTalk and Film Topics.",
    "Dermot Craddock laughed.",
    "He couldnt help it.",
    "I must say he said it tickles me to see you sitting there and telling\nme what your course of literature has been.",
    "I found it very interesting said Miss Marple.",
    "Theyre not\nparticularly well written if I may say so.",
    "But it really is\ndisappointing in a way that it is all so much the same as it used to\nbe in my young days.",
    "Modern Society and Tit Bits and all the rest of\nthem.",
    "A lot of gossip.",
    "A lot of scandal.",
    "A great preoccupation with\nwho is in love with whom and all the rest of it.",
    "Really you know\npractically exactly the same sort of thing goes on in St Mary Mead.",
    "And in the Development too.",
    "Human nature I mean is just the same\neverywhere.",
    "One comes back I think to the question of who could\nhave been likely to want to kill Marina Gregg to want to so much\nthat having failed once they sent threatening letters and made\nrepeated attempts to do so.",
    "Someone perhaps a little  very gently\nshe tapped her forehead.",
    "Yes said Craddock that certainly seems indicated.",
    "And of course\nit doesnt always show.",
    "Oh I know agreed Miss Marple fervently.",
    "Old Mrs Pikes second\nboy Alfred seemed perfectly rational and normal.",
    "Almost painfully\nprosaic if you know what I mean but actually it seems he had the\nmost abnormal psychology or so I understand.",
    "Really positively\ndangerous.",
    "He seems quite happy and contented so Mrs Pike told\nme now that he is in Fairways Mental Home.",
    "They understand him\nthere and the doctors think him a most interesting case.",
    "That of\ncourse pleases him very much.",
    "Yes it all ended quite happily but\nshe had one or two very near escapes.",
    "Craddock revolved in his mind the possibility of a parallel between\nsomeone in Marina Greggs entourage and Mrs Pikes second son.",
    "The Italian butler continued Miss Marple the one who was killed.",
    "He went to London I understand on the day of his death.",
    "Does\nanyone know what he did there  if you are allowed to tell me that\nis she added conscientiously.",
    "He arrived in London at eleventhirty in the morning said\nCraddock and what he did in London nobody knows until a quarter\nto two he visited his bank and made a deposit of five hundred\npounds in cash.",
    "I may say that there was no confirmation of his\nstory that he went to London to visit an ill relative or a relative who\nhad got into trouble.",
    "None of his relatives there had seen him.",
    "Miss Marple nodded her head appreciatively.",
    "Five hundred pounds she said.",
    "Yes thats quite an interesting\nsum isnt it.",
    "I should imagine it would be the first instalment of a\ngood many other sums wouldnt you\n\nIt looks that way said Craddock.",
    "It was probably all the ready money the person he was threatening\ncould raise.",
    "He may even have pretended to be satisfied with that\nor he may have accepted it as a down payment and the victim may\nhave promised to raise further sums in the immediate future.",
    "It\nseems to knock out the idea that Marina Greggs killer could have\nbeen someone in humble circumstances who had a private\nvendetta against her.",
    "It would also knock out I should say the idea\nof someone whod obtained work as a studio helper or attendant or\na servant or a gardener.",
    "Unless  Miss Marple pointed out  such a\nperson may have been the active agent whereas the employing\nagent may not have been in the neighbourhood.",
    "Hence the visit to\nLondon.",
    "Exactly.",
    "We have in London Ardwyck Fenn Lola Brewster and\nMargot Bence.",
    "All three were present at the party.",
    "All three of them\ncould have met Giuseppe at an arranged meetingplace somewhere\nin London between the hours of eleven and a quarter to two.",
    "Ardwyck Fern was out of his office during those hours.",
    "Lola\nBrewster had left her suite to go shopping.",
    "Margot Bence was not\nin her studio.",
    "By the way \n\nYes said Miss Marple have you something to tell me\n\n\fYou asked me said Dermot about the children.",
    "The children that\nMarina Gregg adopted before she knew she could have a child of\nher own.",
    "Yes I did.",
    "Craddock told her what he had learned.",
    "Margot Bence said Miss Marple softly.",
    "I had a feeling you know\nthat it had something to do with children...",
    "I cant believe that after all these years \n\nI know I know.",
    "One never can.",
    "But do you really my dear Dermot\nknow very much about children Think back to your own childhood.",
    "Cant you remember some incident some happening that caused\nyou grief or a passion quite incommensurate with its real\nimportance Some sorrow or passionate resentment that has really\nnever been equalled since There was such a book you know\nwritten by that brilliant writer.",
    "Mr Richard Hughes.",
    "I forget the\nname of it but it was about some children who had been through a\nhurricane.",
    "Oh yes  the hurricane in Jamaica.",
    "What made a vivid\nimpression on them was their cat rushing madly through the house.",
    "It was the only thing they remembered.",
    "But the whole of the horror\nand excitement and fear that they had experienced was bound up in\nthat one incident.",
    "Its odd you should say that said Craddock thoughtfully.",
    "Why has it made you remember something\n\n\fI was thinking of when my mother died.",
    "I was five I think.",
    "Five or six.",
    "I was having dinner in the nursery jam roll pudding.",
    "I was very fond\nof jam roll pudding.",
    "One of the servants came in and said to my\nnursery governess Isnt it awful Theres been an accident and\nMrs Craddock has been killed....",
    "Whenever I think of my mothers\ndeath dyou know what I see\n\nWhat\n\nA plate with jam roll pudding on it and Im staring at it.",
    "Staring at it\nand I can see as well now as then how the jam oozed out of it at one\nside.",
    "I didnt cry or say anything.",
    "I remember just sitting there as\nthough Id been frozen stiff staring at the pudding.",
    "And dyou know\neven now if I see in a shop or a restaurant or in anyones house a\nportion of jam roll pudding a whole wave of horror and misery and\ndespair comes over me.",
    "Sometimes for a moment I dont remember\nwhy.",
    "Does that seem very crazy to you\n\nNo said Miss Marple it seems entirely natural.",
    "Its very\ninteresting that.",
    "Its given me a sort of idea...",
    "The door opened and Miss Knight appeared bearing the tea tray.",
    "Dear dear she exclaimed and so weve got a visitor have we\nHow very nice.",
    "How do you do Inspector Craddock.",
    "Ill just fetch\nanother cup.",
    "Dont bother Dermot called after her.",
    "Ive had a drink instead.",
    "Miss Knight popped her head back round the door.",
    "I wonder  could you just come here a minute Mr Craddock\n\nDermot joined her in the hall.",
    "She went to the diningroom and shut\nthe door.",
    "You will be careful wont you she said.",
    "Careful In what way Miss Knight\n\nOur old dear in there.",
    "You know shes so interested in everything\nbut its not very good for her to get excited over murders and nasty\nthings like that.",
    "We dont want her to brood and have bad dreams.",
    "Shes very old and frail and she really must lead a very sheltered\nlife.",
    "She always has you know.",
    "Im sure all this talk of murders and\ngangsters and things like that is very very bad for her.",
    "Dermot looked at her with faint amusement.",
    "I dont think he said gently that anything that you or I could say\nabout murders is likely unduly to excite or shock Miss Marple.",
    "I can\nassure you my dear Miss Knight that Miss Marple can contemplate\nmurder and sudden death and indeed crime of all kinds with the\nutmost equanimity.",
    "He went back to the drawingroom and Miss Knight clucking a\nlittle in an indignant manner followed him.",
    "She talked briskly during\ntea with an emphasis on political news in the paper and the most\ncheerful subject she could think of.",
    "When she finally removed the\n\n\ftea tray and shut the door behind her Miss Marple drew a deep\nbreath.",
    "At last weve got some peace she said.",
    "I hope I shant murder that\nwoman some day.",
    "Now listen Dermot there are some things I want\nto know.",
    "Yes What are they\n\nI want to go over very carefully what happened on the day of the\nf\u043ate.",
    "Mrs Bantry has arrived and the vicar shortly after her.",
    "Then\ncome Mr and Mrs Badcock ad on the stairs at that time were the\nmayor and his wife this man Ardwyck Fenn Lola Brewster a\nreporter from the Herald Argus of Much Benham and this\nphotographer girl Margot Bence.",
    "Margot Bence you said had her\ncamera at an angle on the stairs and was taking photographs of\nthe proceedings.",
    "Have you seen any of those photographs\n\nActually I brought one to show you.",
    "He took from his pocket an unmounted print.",
    "Miss Marple looked at\nit steadfastly.",
    "Marina Gregg with Jason Rudd a little behind her to\none side Arthur Badcock his hand to his face looking slightly\nembarrassed was standing back whilst his wife had Marina\nGreggs hand in hers and was looking up at her and talking.",
    "Marina\nwas not looking at Mrs Badcock.",
    "She was staring over her head\nlooking it seemed full into the camera or possibly just slightly to\nthe left of it.",
    "Very interesting said Miss Marple.",
    "Ive had descriptions you\nknow of what this look was on her face.",
    "A frozen look.",
    "Yes that\ndescribes it quite well.",
    "A look of doom.",
    "Im not really so sure about\nthat.",
    "Its more a kind of paralysis of feeling rather than\napprehension of doom.",
    "Dont you think so I wouldnt say it was\nactually fear would you although fear of course might take you\nthat way.",
    "It might paralyse you.",
    "But I dont think it was fear.",
    "I think\nrather that it was shock.",
    "Dermot my dear boy I want you to tell me\nif youve got notes of it what exactly Heather Badcock said to\nMarina Gregg on that occasion.",
    "I know roughly the gist of it of\ncourse but how near can you get to the actual words.",
    "I suppose\nyou had accounts of it from different people.",
    "Dermot nodded.",
    "Yes.",
    "Let me see.",
    "Your friend Mrs Bantry then Jason Rudd and I\nthink Arthur Badcock.",
    "As you say they varied a little in wording but\nthe gist of them was the same.",
    "I know.",
    "Its the variations that I want.",
    "I think it might help us.",
    "I dont see how said Dermot though perhaps you do.",
    "Your friend\nMrs Bantry was probably the most definite on the point.",
    "As far as I\nremember  wait  I carry a good many of my jottings around with\nme.",
    "He took out a small notebook from his pocket looked through it to\nrefresh his memory.",
    "I havent got the exact words here he said but I made a rough\nnote.",
    "Apparently Mrs Badcock was very cheerful rather arch and\ndelighted with herself.",
    "She said something like I cant tell you how\nwonderful this is for me.",
    "You wont remember but years ago in\nBermuda  I got up from bed when I had chicken pox and came\nalong to see you and you gave me an autograph and its one of the\nproudest days of my life which I have never forgotten.",
    "I see said Miss Marple she mentioned the place but not the date\ndid she\n\nYes.",
    "And what did Rudd say\n\nJason Rudd He said that Mrs Badcock told his wife that shed got\nup from bed when she had the flu and had come to meet Marina\nand she still had her autograph.",
    "It was a shorter account than your\nfriends but the gist of it was the same.",
    "Did he mention the time and place\n\nNo.",
    "I dont think he did.",
    "I think he said roughly that it was some ten\nor twelve years ago.",
    "I see.",
    "And what about Mr Badcock\n\nMr Badcock said that Heather was extremely excited and anxious\nto meet Marina Gregg that she was a great fan of Marina Greggs\nand that shed told him that once when she was ill as a girl she\n\n\fmanaged to get up and meet Miss Gregg and get her autograph.",
    "He\ndidnt go into any close particulars as it was evidently in the days\nbefore he was married to his wife.",
    "He impressed me as not thinking\nthe incident of much importance.",
    "I see said Miss Marple.",
    "Yes I see...\n\nAnd what do you see asked Craddock.",
    "Not quite as much as Id like to yet said Miss Marple honestly but\nI have a sort of feeling if I only knew why shed ruined her new dress\n\n\nWho  Mrs Badcock\n\nYes.",
    "It seems to me such a very odd thing  such an inexplicable\none unless  of course  Dear me I think I must be very stupid\n\nMiss Knight opened the door and entered switching the light on as\nshe did so.",
    "I think we want a little light in here she said brightly.",
    "Yes said Miss Marple you are so right Miss Knight.",
    "That is\nexactly what we did want.",
    "A little light.",
    "I think you know that at last\nweve got it.",
    "The t\u043ate\u0430t\u043ate seemed ended and Craddock rose to his feet.",
    "There only remains one thing he said and that is for you to tell me\njust what particular memory from your own past is agitating your\nmind now.",
    "Everyone always teases me about that said Miss Marple but I\nmust say that I was reminded just for a moment of the Lauristons\nparlourmaid.",
    "The\n\nLauristons\n\nparlourmaid\n\nCraddock\n\nlooked\n\ncompletely\n\nmystified.",
    "She had of course to take messages on the telephone said Miss\nMarple and she wasnt very good at it.",
    "She used to get the general\nsense right if you know what I mean but the way she wrote it down\nused to make quite nonsense of it sometimes.",
    "I suppose really\nbecause her grammar was so bad.",
    "The result was that some very\nunfortunate incidents occurred.",
    "I remember one in particular.",
    "A Mr\nBurroughs I think it was rang up and said he had been to see Mr\nElvaston about the fence being broken down but he said that the\nfence wasnt his business at all to repair.",
    "It was on the other side of\nthe property and he said he would like to know if that was really the\ncase before proceeding further as it would depend on whether he\nwas liable or not and it was important for him to know the proper lie\nof the land before instructing solicitors.",
    "A very obscure message\nas you see.",
    "It confused rather than enlightened.",
    "If youre talking about parlourmaids said Miss Knight with a little\nlaugh that must have been a very long time ago.",
    "Ive never heard\nof a parlourmaid for many years now.",
    "It was a good many years ago said Miss Marple but nevertheless\nhuman nature was very much the same then as it is now.",
    "Mistakes\nwere made for very much the same reasons.",
    "Oh dear she added I\nam thankful that that girl is safely in Bournemouth.",
    "The girl What girl asked Dermot.",
    "That girl who did dressmaking and went up to see Giuseppe that\nday.",
    "What was her name  Gladys something.",
    "Gladys Dixon\n\nYes thats the name.",
    "Shes in Bournemouth do you say How on earth do you know\nthat\n\nI know said Miss Marple because I sent her there.",
    "What Dermot stared at her.",
    "You Why\n\nI went out to see her said Miss Marple and I gave her some\nmoney and told her to take a holiday and not to write home.",
    "Why on earth did you do that\n\nBecause I didnt want her to be killed of course said Miss Marple\nand blinked at him placidly.",
    "Chapter 22\n\nSuch a sweet letter from Lady Conway Miss Knight said two days\nlater as she deposited Miss Marples breakfast tray.",
    "You remember\nmy telling you about her Just a little you know  she tapped her\nforehead  wanders sometimes.",
    "And her memorys bad.",
    "Cant\nrecognize her relations always and tells them to go away.",
    "That might be shrewdness really said Miss Marple rather than a\nloss of memory.",
    "Now now said Miss Knight arent we being naughty to make\nsuggestions like that Shes spending the winter at the Belgrave\nHotel at Llandudno.",
    "Such a nice residential hotel.",
    "Splendid grounds\nand a very nice glassedin terrace.",
    "Shes most anxious for me to\ncome and join her there.",
    "She sighed.",
    "Miss Marple sat herself upright in bed.",
    "But please she said if you are wanted  if you are needed there\nand would like to go \n\nNo no I couldnt hear of it cried Miss Knight.",
    "Oh no I never\nmeant anything like that.",
    "Why what would Mr Raymond West say\nHe explained to me that being here might turn out to be a\npermanency.",
    "I should never dream of not fulfilling my obligations.",
    "I\nwas only just mentioning the fact in passing so dont worry dear\nshe added patting Miss Marple on the shoulder.",
    "Were not going to\n\n\fbe deserted no no indeed were not were going to be looked\nafter and cosseted and made very happy and comfortable always.",
    "She went out of the room.",
    "Miss Marple sat with an air of\ndetermination staring at her tray and failing to eat anything.",
    "Finally\nshe picked up the receiver of the telephone and dialled with vigour.",
    "Dr Haydock\n\nYes\n\nJane Marple here.",
    "And whats the matter with you In need of my professional\nservices\n\nNo said Miss Marple.",
    "But I want to see you as soon as possible.",
    "When Dr Haydock came he found Miss Marple still in bed waiting\nfor him.",
    "You look the picture of health he complained.",
    "That is why I wanted to see you said Miss Marple.",
    "To tell you that I\nam perfectly well.",
    "An unusual reason for sending for the doctor.",
    "Im quite strong Im quite fit and its absurd to have anybody living\nin the house.",
    "So long as someone comes every day and does the\n\n\fcleaning and all that I dont see any need at all for having someone\nliving here permanently.",
    "I dare say you dont but I do said Dr Haydock.",
    "It seems to me youre turning into a regular old fussbudget said\nMiss Marple unkindly.",
    "And dont call me names said Dr Haydock.",
    "Youre a very healthy\nwoman for your age you were pulled down a bit by bronchitis\nwhich isnt good for the elderly.",
    "But to stay alone in a house at your\nage is a risk.",
    "Supposing you fall down the stairs one evening or fall\nout of bed or slip in the bath.",
    "There youd lie and nobodyd know\nabout it.",
    "One can imagine anything said Miss Marple.",
    "Miss Knight might\nfall down the stairs and Id fall over her rushing out to see what had\nhappened.",
    "Its no good your bullying me said Dr Haydock.",
    "Youre an old lady\nand youve got to be looked after in a proper manner.",
    "If you dont\nlike this woman youve got change her and get somebody else.",
    "Thats not always so easy said Miss Marple.",
    "Find some old servant of yours someone that you like and whos\nlived with you before.",
    "I can see this old hen irritates you.",
    "Shed\nirritate me.",
    "There must be some old servant somewhere.",
    "That\nnephew of yours is one of the bestselling authors of the day.",
    "Hed\nmake it worth her while if you found the right person.",
    "Of course dear Raymond would do anything of that kind.",
    "He is most\ngenerous said Miss Marple.",
    "But its not so easy to find the right\nperson.",
    "Young people have their own lives to live and so many of\nmy faithful old servants I am sorry to say are dead.",
    "Well youre not dead said Dr Haydock and youll live a good deal\nlonger if you take proper care of yourself.",
    "He rose to his feet.",
    "Well he said.",
    "No good my stopping here.",
    "You look as fit as a\nfiddle.",
    "I shant waste time taking your blood pressure or feeling\nyour pulse or asking you questions.",

    "So Ill ask you to keep this knowledge\nto yourself for the moment.",
    "Of course.",
    "Was it an accident\n\nThat is definitely my view said Gilchrist.",
    "But it could be suicide.",
    "It could  but most unlikely.",
    "Or someone could have given it to her\n\nGilchrist shrugged his shoulders.",
    "A most remote contingency.",
    "And a thing he added firmly that\nwould be quite impossible to prove.",
    "I see said Miss Marple.",
    "She took a deep breath.",
    "Im sorry but its\nmore necessary than ever that I should see Mr Rudd.",
    "Gilchrist looked at her.",
    "Wait here he said.",
    "Chapter 23\n\nJason Rudd looked up as Gilchrist entered.",
    "Theres an old dame downstairs said the doctor looks about a\nhundred.",
    "Wants to see you.",
    "Wont take no and says shell wait.",
    "Shell wait till this afternoon I gather or shell wait till this evening\nand shes quite capable I should say of spending the night here.",

    "Jason Rudd looked up from his desk.",
    "His face was white and\nstrained.",

    "You remind me very\nmuch she said of someone I knew called Gerald French.",
    "Indeed What did Gerald French do\n\n\fNot very much said Miss Marple but he was a very good talker.",
    "She sighed.",
    "He had had an unfortunate past.",
    "You dont say said Halley Preston slightly ill at ease.",
    "What kind of\na past\n\nI wont repeat it said Miss Marple.",

    "You wanted to see me he said.",
    "What can I do for you\n\nI am very sorry about your wifes death said Miss Marple.",
    "I can\nsee it has been a great grief to you and I want you to believe that I\nshould not intrude upon you now or offer you sympathy unless it\nwas absolutely necessary.",
    "But there are things that need badly to\nbe cleared up unless an innocent man is going to suffer.",
    "An innocent man I dont understand you.",
    "Arthur Badcock said Miss Marple.",
    "He is with the police now\nbeing questioned.",
    "Questioned in connection with my wifes death But thats absurd\nabsolutely absurd.",

    "Jason Rudd shook his head.",
    "My wife was first married to a man called Alfred Beadle.",

    "They were not suited and they parted almost\nimmediately.",
    "Then Alfred Beadle changed his name to Badcock said Miss\nMarple.",
    "Hes in a real estate firm here.",
    "Its odd how some people\nnever seem to like to change their job and want to go on doing the\nsame thing.",
    "I expect really thats why Marina Gregg felt that he was\nno use to her.",
    "He couldnt have kept up with her.",
    "What youve told me is most surprising.",
    "I can assure you that I am not romancing or imagining things.",
    "What\nI am telling you is sober fact.",
    "These things get round very quickly in\na village you know though they take a little longer she added in\nreaching the Hall.",
    "Well Jason Rudd stalled uncertain what to say then he accepted\nthe position and what do you want me to do for you Miss Marple\nhe asked.",
    "I want if I may to stand on the stairs at the spot where you and\nyour wife received guests on the day of the f\u043ate.",
    "He shot a quick doubtful glance at her.",
    "Was this after all just\nanother sensationseeker But Miss Marples face was grave and\ncomposed.",
    "Why certainly he said if you want to do so.",
    "Come with me.",
    "He led her to the staircase head and paused in the hollowedout\nbay at the top of it.",
    "Youve made a good many changes in the house since the Bantrys\nwere here said Miss Marple.",
    "I like this.",
    "Now let me see.",
    "The tables\nwould be about here I suppose and you and your wife would be\nstanding \n\nMy wife stood here.",
    "Jason showed her the place.",
    "People came up\nthe stairs she shook hands with them and passed them on to me.",
    "She stood here said Miss Marple.",
    "She moved over and took her place where Marina Gregg had stood.",
    "She remained there quite quietly without moving.",
    "Jason Rudd\nwatched her.",
    "He was perplexed but interested.",
    "She raised her right\nhand slightly as though shaking looked down the stairs as though\n\n\fto see people coming up it.",
    "Then she looked straight ahead of her.",
    "On the wall halfway up the stairs was a large picture a copy of an\nItalian Old Master.",
    "On either side of it were narrow windows one\ngiving out on the garden and the other giving on to the end of the\nstables and the weathercock.",
    "But Miss Marple looked at neither of\nthese.",
    "Her eyes were fixed on the picture itself.",
    "Of course you always hear a thing right the first time she said.",
    "Mrs Bantry told me that your wife stared at the picture and her face\nfroze as she put it.",
    "She looked at the rich red and blue robes of\nthe Madonna a Madonna with her head slightly back laughing up at\nthe Holy Child that she was holding up in her arms.",
    "Giacomo\nBellinis Laughing Madonna she said.",
    "A religious picture but\nalso a painting of a happy mother with her child.",
    "Isnt that so Mr\nRudd\n\nI would say so yes.",
    "I understand now said Miss Marple.",
    "I understand quite well.",
    "The\nwhole thing is really very simple isnt it She looked at Jason\nRudd.",
    "Simple\n\nI think you know how simple it is said Miss Marple.",
    "There was a\npeal on the bell below.",
    "I dont think said Jason Rudd I quite understand.",
    "He looked\ndown the stairway.",
    "There was a sound of voices.",
    "I know that voice said Miss Marple its Inspector Craddocks\nvoice isnt it\n\nYes it seems to be Inspector Craddock.",
    "He wants to see you too.",
    "Would you mind very much if he joined\nus\n\nNot at all as far as I am concerned.",
    "Whether he will agree \n\nI think he will agree said Miss Marple.",
    "Theres really not much\ntime now to be lost is there Weve got to the moment when weve\ngot to understand just how everything happened.",
    "I thought you said it was simple said Jason Rudd.",
    "It was so simple said Miss Marple that one just couldnt see it.",
    "The decayed butler arrived at this moment up the stairs.",
    "Inspector Craddock is here sir he said.",
    "Ask him to join us here please said Jason Rudd.",
    "The butler disappeared again and a moment or two later Dermot\nCraddock came up the stairs.",
    "You he said to Miss Marple how did you get here\n\n\fI came in Inch said Miss Marple producing the usual confused\neffect that that remark always caused.",
    "From slightly behind her Jason Rudd rapped his forehead\ninterrogatively.",
    "Dermot Craddock shook his head.",
    "I was saying to Mr Rudd said Miss Marple  has the butler gone\naway \n\nDermot Craddock cast a look down the stairs.",
    "Oh yes he said hes not listening.",
    "Sergeant Tiddler will see to\nthat.",
    "Then that is all right said Miss Marple.",
    "We could of course have\ngone into a room to talk but I prefer it like this.",
    "Here we are on the\nspot where the thing happened which makes it so much easier to\nunderstand.",
    "You are talking said Jason Rudd of the day of the f\u043ate here the\nday when Heather Badcock was poisoned.",
    "Yes said Miss Marple and Im saying that it is all very simple if\none only looks at it in the proper way.",
    "It all began you see with\nHeather Badcock being the kind of person she was.",
    "It was\ninevitable really that something of that kind should happen some\nday to Heather.",
    "I dont understand what you mean said Jason Rudd.",
    "I dont\nunderstand at all.",
    "No it has to be explained a little.",
    "You see when my friend Mrs\nBantry who was here described the scene to me she quoted a\npoem that was a great favourite in my youth a poem of dear Lord\nTennysons.",
    "The Lady of Shalott.",
    "She raised her voice a little.",
    "The mirror crackd from ride to side\n\nThe Curse is come upon me cried\n\nThe Lady of Shalott.",
    "Thats what Mrs Bantry saw or thought she saw though actually\nshe misquoted and said doom instead of curse perhaps a better\nword in the circumstances.",
    "She saw your wife speaking to Heather\nBadcock and heard Heather Badcock speaking to your wife and\nshe saw this look of doom on your wifes face.",
    "Havent we been over that a great many times said Jason Rudd.",
    "Yes but we shall have to go over it once more said Miss Marple.",
    "There was that expression on your wifes face and she was looking\nnot at Heather Badcock but at that picture.",
    "At a picture of a\nlaughing happy mother holding up a happy child.",
    "The mistake was\nthat though there was doom foreshadowed in Marina Greggs face\nit was not on her the doom would come.",
    "The doom was to come\nupon Heather.",
    "Heather was doomed from the first moment that she\nbegan talking and boasting of an incident in the past.",
    "Could you make yourself a little clearer said Dermot Craddock.",
    "Miss Marple turned to him.",
    "Of course I will.",
    "This is something that you know nothing about.",
    "You\ncouldnt know about it because nobody has told you what it was\nHeather Badcock actually said.",
    "But they have protested Dermot.",
    "Theyve told me over and over\nagain.",
    "Several people have told me.",
    "Yes said Miss Marple but you dont know because you see\nHeather Badcock didnt tell it to you.",
    "She hardly could tell it to me seeing she was dead when I arrived\nhere said Dermot.",
    "Quite so said Miss Marple.",
    "All you know is that she was ill but she\ngot up from bed and came along to a celebration of some kind\nwhere she met Marina Gregg and spoke to her and asked for an\nautograph and was given one.",
    "I know said Craddock with slight impatience.",
    "Ive heard all that.",
    "But you didnt hear the one operative phrase because no one\nthought it was important said Miss Marple.",
    "Heather Badcock was\nill in bed  with German measles.",
    "German measles What on earth has that got to do with it\n\n\fIts a very slight illness really said Miss Marple.",
    "It hardly makes\nyou feel ill at all.",
    "You have a rash which is easy to cover up with\npowder and you have a little fever but not very much.",
    "You feel\nquite well enough to go out and see people if you want to.",
    "And of\ncourse in repeating all this the fact that it was German measles\ndidnt strike people particularly.",
    "Mrs Bantry for instance just said\nthat Heather had been ill in bed and mentioned chicken pox and\nnettlerash.",
    "Mr Rudd here said that it was flu but of course he did\nthat on purpose.",
    "But I think myself that what Heather Badcock said\nto Marina Gregg was that she had had German measles and got up\nfrom bed and went off to meet Marina.",
    "And thats really the answer\nto the whole thing because you see German measles is extremely\ninfectious.",
    "People catch it very easily.",
    "And theres one thing about it\nwhich youve got to remember.",
    "If a woman contracts it in the first\nfour months of Miss Marple spoke the next word with a slight\nVictorian modesty  of  er  pregnancy it may have a terribly\nserious effect.",
    "It may cause an unborn child to be born blind or to\nbe born mentally affected.",
    "She turned to Jason Rudd.",
    "I think I am correct in saying Mr Rudd that your wife had a child\nwho was born mentally afflicted and that she has never really\nrecovered from the shock.",
    "She had always wanted a child and\nwhen at last the child came this was the tragedy that happened.",
    "A\ntragedy she has never forgotten that she has not allowed herself to\nforget and which ate into her as a kind of deep sore an obsession.",
    "Its quite true said Jason Rudd.",
    "Marina developed German\nmeasles early on in her pregnancy and was told by the doctor that\nthe mental affliction of her child was due to that cause.",
    "It was not a\ncase of inherited insanity or anything of that kind.",
    "He was trying to\nbe helpful but I dont think it helped her much.",
    "She never knew how\nor when or from whom she had contracted the disease.",
    "Quite so said Miss Marple she never knew until one afternoon\nhere when a perfectly strange woman came up those stairs and\ntold her the fact  told her what was more  with a great deal of\npleasure With an air of being proud of what shed done She\nthought shed been resourceful and brave and shown a lot of spirit\nin getting up from her bed covering her face with makeup and\ngoing along to meet the actress on whom she had such a crush and\nobtaining her autograph.",
    "Its a thing she has boasted of all through\nher life.",
    "Heather Badcock meant no harm.",
    "She never did mean\nharm but there is no doubt that people like Heather Badcock and\nlike my old friend Alison Wilde are capable of doing a lot of harm\nbecause they lack not kindness they have kindness  but any real\nconsideration for the way their actions may affect other people.",
    "She thought always of what an action meant to her never sparing a\nthought to what it might mean to somebody else.",
    "Miss Marple nodded her head gently.",
    "So she died you see for a simple reason out of her own past.",
    "You\nmust imagine what that moment meant to Marina Gregg.",
    "I think Mr\nRudd understands it very well.",
    "I think she had nursed all those\nyears a kind of hatred for the unknown person who had been the\ncause of her tragedy.",
    "And here suddenly she meets that person\n\n\fface to face.",
    "And a person who is gay jolly and pleased with\nherself.",
    "It was too much for her.",
    "If she had had time to think to calm\ndown to be persuaded to relax  but she gave herself no time.",
    "Here\nwas this woman who had destroyed her happiness and destroyed\nthe sanity and health of her child.",
    "She wanted to punish her.",
    "She\nwanted to kill her.",
    "And unfortunately the means were at hand.",
    "She\ncarried with her that wellknown specific Calmo.",
    "A somewhat\ndangerous drug because you had to be careful of the exact dosage.",
    "It was very easy to do.",
    "She put the stuff into her own glass.",
    "If by any\nchance anyone noticed what she was doing they were probably so\nused to her pepping herself up or soothing herself down in any\nhandy liquid that theyd hardly notice it.",
    "Its possible that one\nperson did see her but I rather doubt it.",
    "I think that Miss Zielinsky\ndid no more than guess.",
    "Marina Gregg put her glass down on the\ntable and presently she managed to jog Heather Badcocks arm so\nthat Heather Badcock spilt her own drink all down her new dress.",
    "And thats where the element of puzzle has come into the matter\nowing to the fact that people cannot remember to use their\npronouns properly.",
    "It reminds me so much of that parlourmaid I was telling you about\nshe added to Dermot.",
    "I only had the account you see of what\nGladys Dixon said to Cherry which simply was that she was worried\nabout the ruin of Heather Badcocks dress with the cocktail spilt\ndown it.",
    "What seemed so funny she said was that she did it on\npurpose.",
    "But the she that Gladys referred to was not Heather\nBadcock it was Marina Gregg.",
    "As Gladys said She did it on\npurpose She jogged Heathers arm.",
    "Not by accident but because\nshe meant to do so.",
    "We do know that she must have been standing\nvery close to Heather because we have heard that she mopped up\n\n\fboth Heathers dress and her own before pressing her cocktail on\nHeather.",
    "It was really said Miss Marple meditatively a very\nperfect murder because you see it was committed on the spur of\nthe moment without pausing to think or reflect.",
    "She wanted Heather\nBadcock dead and a few minutes later Heather Badcock was dead.",
    "She didnt realize perhaps the seriousness of what shed done and\ncertainly not the danger of it until afterwards.",
    "But she realized it\nthen.",
    "She was afraid horribly afraid.",
    "Afraid that someone had seen\nher dope her own glass that someone had seen her deliberately jog\nHeathers elbow afraid that someone would accuse her of having\npoisoned Heather.",
    "She could see only one way out.",
    "To insist that\nthe murder had been aimed at her that she was the prospective\nvictim.",
    "She tried that idea first on her doctor.",
    "She refused to let him\ntell her husband because I think she knew that her husband would\nnot be deceived.",
    "She did fantastic things.",
    "She wrote notes to\nherself and arranged to find them in extraordinary places and at\nextraordinary moments.",
    "She doctored her own coffee at the studios\none day.",
    "She did things that could really have been seen through\nfairly easily if one had happened to be thinking that way.",
    "They were\nseen through by one person.",
    "She looked at Jason Rudd.",
    "This is only a theory of yours said Jason Rudd.",
    "You can put it that way if you like said Miss Marple but you know\nquite well dont you Mr Rudd that Im speaking the truth.",
    "You\nknow because you knew from the first.",
    "You knew because you\nheard that mention of German measles.",
    "You knew and you were\nfrantic to protect her.",
    "But you didnt realize how much you would\n\n\fhave to protect her from.",
    "You didnt realize that it was not only a\nquestion of hushing up one death the death of a woman whom you\nmight say quite fairly had brought her death on herself.",
    "But there\nwere other deaths  the death of Giuseppe a blackmailer it is true\nbut a human being.",
    "And the death of Ella Zielinsky of whom I expect\nyou were fond.",
    "You were frantic to protect Marina and also to\nprevent her from doing more harm.",
    "All you wanted was to get her\nsafely away somewhere.",
    "You tried to watch her all the time to make\nsure that nothing more should happen.",
    "She paused and then coming nearer to Jason Rudd she laid a\ngentle hand on his arm.",
    "I am very sorry for you she said very sorry.",
    "I do realize the agony\nyouve been through.",
    "You cared for her so much didnt you\n\nJason Rudd turned slightly away.",
    "That he said is I believe common knowledge.",
    "She was such a beautiful creature said Miss Marple gently.",
    "She\nhad such a wonderful gift.",
    "She had a great power of love and hate\nbut no stability.",
    "Thats whats so sad for anyone to be born with no\nstability.",
    "She couldnt let the past go and she could never see the\nfuture as it really was only as she imagined it to be.",
    "She was a\ngreat actress and a beautiful and very unhappy woman.",
    "What a\nwonderful Mary Queen of Scots she was I shall never forget her.",
    "Sergeant Tiddler appeared suddenly on the stairs.",
    "Sir he said can I speak to you a moment\n\nCraddock turned.",
    "Ill be back he said to Jason Rudd then he went towards the\nstairs.",
    "Remember Miss Marple called after him poor Arthur Badcock\nhad nothing to do with this.",
    "He came to the f\u043ate because he wanted\nto have a glimpse of the girl he had married long ago.",
    "I should say\nshe didnt even recognize him.",
    "Did she she asked Jason Rudd.",
    "Jason Rudd shook his head.",
    "I dont think so.",
    "She certainly never said anything to me.",
    "I dont\nthink he added thoughtfully she would recognize him.",
    "Probably not said Miss Marple.",
    "Anyway she added hes quite\ninnocent of wanting to kill her or anything of that kind.",
    "Remember\nthat she added to Dermot Craddock as he went down the stairs.",
    "Hes not been in any real danger I can assure you said Craddock\nbut of course when we found out that he had actually been Miss\nMarina Greggs first husband we naturally had to question him on\nthe point.",
    "Dont worry about him Aunt Jane he added in a low\nmurmur then he hurried down the stairs.",
    "Miss Marple turned to Jason Rudd.",
    "He was standing there like a\nman in a daze his eyes far away.",
    "Would you allow me to see her said Miss Marple.",
    "He considered her for a moment or two then he nodded.",
    "Yes you can see her.",
    "You seem to  understand her very well.",
    "He turned and Miss Marple followed him.",
    "He preceded her into the\nbig bedroom and drew the curtains slightly aside.",
    "Marina Gregg lay in the great white shell of the bed  her eyes\nclosed her hands folded.",
    "So Miss Marple thought might the Lady of Shalott have lain in the\nboat that carried her down to Camelot.",
    "And there standing musing\nwas a man with a rugged ugly face who might pass as a Lancelot\nof a later day.",
    "Miss Marple said gently Its very fortunate for her that she  took an\noverdose.",
    "Death was really the only way of escape left to her.",
    "Yes very fortunate she took that overdose  or  was given it\n\nHis eyes met hers but he did not speak.",
    "He said brokenly She was  so lovely  and she had suffered so\nmuch.",
    "Miss Marple looked back again at the still figure.",
    "She quoted softly the last lines of the poem\n\n\fHe said She has a lovely face\nGod in His mercy lend her grace\nThe Lady of Shalott."
