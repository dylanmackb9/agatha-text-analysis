    "Evil under the Sun\nAgatha Christie\n1941\n\n\f2\n\n\fTo John\nIn memory of our last season in Syria\n\n3\n\n\f4\n\n\fChapter 1\nWhen Captain Roger Angmering built himself a house in the year 1782 on the island off\nLeathercombe Bay it was thought the height of eccentricity on his part.",
    "A man of good\nfamily such as he was should have had a decorous mansion set in wide meadows with\nperhaps a running stream and good pasture.",
    "But Captain Roger Angmering had only one great love the sea.",
    "So he built his house\u2014a\nsturdy house too as it needed to be on the little windswept gull\u2010haunted promontory\u2014\ncut off from land at each high tide.",
    "He did not marry the sea was his first and last spouse and at his death the house and\nisland went to a distant cousin.",
    "That cousin and his descendants thought little of the\nbequest.",
    "Their own acres dwindled and their heirs grew steadily poorer.",
    "In 1922 when the great cult of the Seaside for Holidays was finally established and the\ncoast of Devon and Cornwall was no longer thought too hot in the summer Arthur\nAngmering found his vast inconvenient late Georgian house unsaleable but he got a good\nprice for the odd bit of property acquired by the seafaring Captain Roger.",
    "The sturdy house was added to and embellished.",
    "A concrete causeway was laid down\nfrom the mainland to the island.",
    "\u2018Walks\u2019 and \u2018Nooks\u2019 were cut and devised all round the\nisland.",
    "There were two tennis courts sun\u2010terraces leading down to a little bay embellished\nwith rafts and diving boards.",
    "The Jolly Roger Hotel Smugglers\u2019 Island Leathercombe Bay\ncame triumphantly into being.",
    "And from June till September with a short season at\nEaster the Jolly Roger Hotel was usually packed to the attics.",
    "It was enlarged and\nimproved in 1934 by the addition of a cocktail bar a bigger dining\u2010room and some extra\nbathrooms.",
    "The prices went up.",
    "People said \u2018Ever been to Leathercombe Bay Awfully jolly hotel there on a sort of island.",
    "Very comfortable and no trippers or charabancs.",
    "Good cooking and all that.",
    "You ought to\ngo.\u2019\nAnd people did go.",
    "II\nThere was one very important person in his own estimation at least staying at the Jolly\nRoger.",
    "Hercule Poirot resplendent in a white duck suit with a panama hat tilted over his\neyes his moustaches magnificently befurled lay back in an improved type of deck\u2010chair\nand surveyed the bathing beach.",
    "A series of terraces led down to it from the hotel.",
    "On the\nbeach itself were floats lilos rubber and canvas boats balls and rubber toys.",
    "There was a\nlong springboard and three rafts at varying distances from the shore.",
    "Of the bathers some were in the sea some were lying stretched out in the sun and some\nwere anointing themselves carefully with oil.",
    "5\n\n\fOn the terrace immediately above the non\u2010bathers sat and commented on the weather\nthe scene in front of them the news in the morning papers and any other subject that\nappealed to them.",
    "On Poirot\u2019s left a ceaseless flow of conversation poured in a gentle monotone from the\nlips of Mrs Gardener while at the same time her needles clacked as she knitted vigorously.",
    "Beyond her her husband Odell C. Gardener lay in a hammock chair his hat tilted forward\nover his nose and occasionally uttered a brief statement when called upon to do so.",
    "On Poirot\u2019s right Miss Brewster a tough athletic woman with grizzled hair and a pleasant\nweather\u2010beaten face made gruff comments.",
    "The result sounded rather like a sheepdog\nwhose short stentorian barks interrupted the ceaseless yapping of a Pomeranian.",
    "Mrs Gardener was saying \u2018And so I said to Mr Gardener why I said sightseeing is all very\nwell and I do like to do a place thoroughly.",
    "But after all I said we\u2019ve done England pretty\nwell and all I want now is to get to some quiet spot by the seaside and just relax.",
    "That\u2019s\nwhat I said wasn\u2019t it Odell Just relax.",
    "I feel I must relax I said.",
    "That\u2019s so isn\u2019t it Odell\u2019\nMr Gardener from behind his hat murmured \u2018Yes darling.\u2019\nMrs Gardener pursued the theme.",
    "\u2018And so when I mentioned it to Mr Kelso at Cook\u2019s\u2014He\u2019s arranged all our itinerary for us\nand been most helpful in every way.",
    "I don\u2019t really know what we\u2019d have done without\nhim\u2014well as I say when I mentioned it to him Mr Kelso said that we couldn\u2019t do better\nthan come here.",
    "A most picturesque spot he said quite out of the world and at the same\ntime very comfortable and most exclusive in every way.",
    "And of course Mr Gardener he\nchipped in there and said what about the sanitary arrangements Because if you\u2019ll believe\nme M. Poirot a sister of Mr Gardener\u2019s went to stay at a guesthouse once very exclusive\nthey said it was and in the heart of the moors but would you believe me nothing but an\nearth closet So naturally that made Mr Gardener suspicious of these out\u2010of\u2010the\u2010world\nplaces didn\u2019t it Odell\u2019\n\u2018Why yes darling\u2019 said Gardener.",
    "\u2018But Mr Kelso reassured us at once.",
    "The sanitation he said was absolutely the latest word\nand the cooking was excellent.",
    "And I\u2019m sure that\u2019s so.",
    "And what I like about it is it\u2019s\nintime if you know what I mean.",
    "Being a small place we all talk to each other and\neverybody knows everybody.",
    "If there is a fault about the British it is that they\u2019re inclined\nto be a bit stand\u2010offish until they\u2019ve known you a couple of years.",
    "After that nobody could\nbe nicer.",
    "Mr Kelso said that interesting people came here and I see he was right.",
    "There\u2019s\nyou M. Poirot and Miss Darnley.",
    "Oh I was just tickled to death when I found out who you\nwere wasn\u2019t I Odell\u2019\n\u2018You were darling.\u2019\n\u2018Ha\u2019 said Miss Brewster breaking in explosively.",
    "\u2018What a thrill eh M. Poirot\u2019\n6\n\n\fHercule Poirot raised his hands in deprecation.",
    "But it was no more than a polite gesture.",
    "Mrs Gardener flowed smoothly on.",
    "\u2018You see M. Poirot I\u2019d heard a lot about you from Cornelia Robson who was.",
    "Mr Gardener\nand I were at Badenhof in May.",
    "And of course Cornelia told us all about that business in\nEgypt when Linnet Ridgeway was killed.",
    "She said you were wonderful and I\u2019ve always been\nsimply crazy to meet you haven\u2019t I Odell\u2019\n\u2018Yes darling.\u2019\n\u2018And then Miss Darnley too.",
    "I get a lot of my things at Rose Mond\u2019s and of course she is\nRose Mond isn\u2019t she I think her clothes are ever so clever.",
    "Such a marvellous line.",
    "That\ndress I had on last night was one of hers.",
    "She\u2019s just a lovely woman in every way I think.\u2019\nFrom beyond Miss Brewster Major Barry who had been sitting with protuberant eyes\nglued to the bathers grunted out \u2018Distinguished lookin\u2019 gal\u2019\nMrs Gardener clacked her needles.",
    "\u2018I\u2019ve just got to confess one thing M. Poirot.",
    "It gave me a kind of a turn meeting you\nhere\u2014not that I wasn\u2019t just thrilled to meet you because I was.",
    "Mr Gardener knows that.",
    "But it just came to me that you might be here\u2014well professionally.",
    "You know what I\nmean Well I\u2019m just terribly sensitive as Mr Gardener will tell you and I just couldn\u2019t bear\nit if I was to be mixed up in crime of any kind.",
    "You see\u2014\u2019\nMr Gardener cleared his throat.",
    "He said \u2018You see M. Poirot Mrs Gardener is very\nsensitive.\u2019\nThe hands of Hercule Poirot shot into the air.",
    "\u2018But let me assure you Madame that I am here simply in the same way that you are here\nyourselves\u2014to enjoy myself\u2014to spend the holiday.",
    "I do not think of crime even.\u2019\nMiss Brewster said again giving her short gruff bark \u2018No bodies on Smugglers\u2019 Island.\u2019\nHercule Poirot said \u2018Ah but that it is not strictly true.\u2019 He pointed downward.",
    "\u2018Regard\nthem there lying out in rows.",
    "What are they They are not men and women.",
    "There is\nnothing personal about them.",
    "They are just\u2014bodies\u2019\nMajor Barry said appreciatively \u2018Good\u2010looking fillies some of \u2019em.",
    "Bit on the thin side\nperhaps.\u2019\nPoirot cried \u2018Yes but what appeal is there What mystery I I am old of the old school\nWhen I was young one saw barely the ankle.",
    "The glimpse of a foamy petticoat how\nalluring The gentle swelling of the calf\u2014a knee\u2014a beribboned garter\u2014\u2019\n\u2018Naughty naughty\u2019 said Major Barry hoarsely.",
    "7\n\n\f\u2018Much more sensible\u2014the things we wear nowadays\u2019 said Miss Brewster.",
    "\u2018Why yes M. Poirot\u2019 said Mrs Gardener.",
    "\u2018I do think you know that our girls and boys\nnowadays lead a much more natural healthy life.",
    "They just romp about together and\nthey\u2014well they\u2014\u2019 Mrs Gardener blushed slightly for she had a nice mind\u2014\u2018they think\nnothing of it if you know what I mean\u2019\n\u2018I do know\u2019 said Hercule Poirot.",
    "\u2018It is deplorable\u2019\n\u2018Deplorable\u2019 squeaked Mrs Gardener.",
    "\u2018To remove all the romance\u2014all the mystery Today everything is standardized\u2019 He waved\na hand towards the recumbent figures.",
    "\u2018That reminds me very much of the Morgue in\nParis.\u2019\n\u2018M.",
    "Poirot\u2019 Mrs Gardener was scandalized.",
    "\u2018Bodies\u2014arranged on slabs\u2014like butcher\u2019s meat\u2019\n\u2018But M. Poirot isn\u2019t that too far\u2010fetched for words\u2019\nHercule Poirot admitted \u2018It may be yes.\u2019\n\u2018All the same\u2019 Mrs Gardener knitted with energy \u2018I\u2019m inclined to agree with you on one\npoint.",
    "These girls that lie out like that in the sun will grow hair on their legs and arms.",
    "I\u2019ve\nsaid so to Irene\u2014that\u2019s my daughter M. Poirot.",
    "Irene I said to her if you lie out like that\nin the sun you\u2019ll have hair all over you hair on your arms and hair on your legs and hair on\nyour bosom and what will you look like then I said to her.",
    "Didn\u2019t I Odell\u2019\n\u2018Yes darling\u2019 said Mr Gardener.",
    "Everyone was silent perhaps making a mental picture of Irene when the worst had\nhappened.",
    "Mrs Gardener rolled up her knitting and said \u2018I wonder now\u2014\u2019\nMr Gardener said \u2018Yes darling\u2019\nHe struggled out of the hammock chair and took Mrs Gardener\u2019s knitting and her book.",
    "He asked \u2018What about joining us for a drink Miss Brewster\u2019\n\u2018Not just now thanks.\u2019\nThe Gardeners went up to the hotel.",
    "Miss Brewster said \u2018American husbands are wonderful\u2019\n8\n\n\fIII\nMrs Gardener\u2019s place was taken by the Reverend Stephen Lane.",
    "Mr Lane was a tall vigorous clergyman of fifty odd.",
    "His face was tanned and his dark grey\nflannel trousers were holidayfied and disreputable.",
    "He said with enthusiasm \u2018Marvellous country I\u2019ve been from Leathercombe Bay to\nHarford and back over the cliffs.\u2019\n\u2018Warm work walking today\u2019 said Major Barry who never walked.",
    "\u2018Good exercise\u2019 said Miss Brewster.",
    "\u2018I haven\u2019t been for my row yet.",
    "Nothing like rowing\nfor your stomach muscles.\u2019\nThe eyes of Hercule Poirot dropped somewhat ruefully to a certain protuberance in his\nmiddle.",
    "Miss Brewster noting the glance said kindly \u2018You\u2019d soon get that off M. Poirot if you\ntook a rowing\u2010boat out every day.\u2019\n\u2018Merci Mademoiselle.",
    "I detest boats\u2019\n\u2018You mean small boats\u2019\n\u2018Boats of all sizes\u2019 He closed his eyes and shuddered.",
    "\u2018The movement of the sea it is not\npleasant.\u2019\n\u2018Bless the man the sea is as calm as a mill pond today.\u2019\nPoirot replied with conviction \u2018There is no such thing as a really calm sea.",
    "Always always\nthere is motion.\u2019\n\u2018If you ask me\u2019 said Major Barry \u2018seasickness is nine\u2010tenths nerves.\u2019\n\u2018There\u2019 said the clergyman smiling a little \u2018speaks the good sailor\u2014eh Major\u2019\n\u2018Only been ill once\u2014and that was crossing the Channel Don\u2019t think about it that\u2019s my\nmotto.\u2019\n\u2018Seasickness is really a very odd thing\u2019 mused Miss Brewster.",
    "\u2018Why should some people be\nsubject to it and not others It seems so unfair.",
    "And nothing to do with one\u2019s ordinary\nhealth.",
    "Quite sickly people are good sailors.",
    "Someone told me once it was something to do\nwith one\u2019s spine.",
    "Then there\u2019s the way some people can\u2019t stand heights.",
    "I\u2019m not very good\nmyself but Mrs Redfern is far worse.",
    "The other day on the cliff path to Harford she\nturned quite giddy and simply clung to me.",
    "She told me she once got stuck halfway down\nthat outside staircase on Milan Cathedral.",
    "She\u2019d gone up without thinking but coming\ndown did for her.\u2019\n9\n\n\f\u2018She\u2019d better not go down the ladder to Pixy Cove then\u2019 observed Lane.",
    "Miss Brewster made a face.",
    "\u2018I funk that myself.",
    "It\u2019s all right for the young.",
    "The Cowan boys and the young Mastermans\nthey run up and down and enjoy it.\u2019\nLane said.",
    "\u2018Here comes Mrs Redfern now coming up from her bathe.\u2019\nMiss Brewster remarked \u2018M.",
    "Poirot ought to approve of her.",
    "She\u2019s no sun\u2010bather.\u2019\nYoung Mrs Redfern had taken off her rubber cap and was shaking out her hair.",
    "She was an\nash blonde and her skin was of that dead fairness that goes with that colouring.",
    "Her legs\nand arms were very white.",
    "With a hoarse chuckle Major Barry said \u2018Looks a bit uncooked among the others doesn\u2019t\nshe\u2019\nWrapping herself in a long bath\u2010robe Christine Redfern came up the beach and mounted\nthe steps towards them.",
    "She had a fair serious face pretty in a negative way and small dainty hands and feet.",
    "She smiled at them and dropped down beside them tucking her bath\u2010wrap round her.",
    "Miss Brewster said \u2018You have earned M. Poirot\u2019s good opinion.",
    "He doesn\u2019t like the sun\u2010\ntanning crowd.",
    "Says they\u2019re like joints of butcher\u2019s meat or words to that effect.\u2019\nChristine Redfern smiled ruefully.",
    "She said \u2018I wish I could sun\u2010bathe But I don\u2019t go brown.",
    "I only blister and get the most frightful freckles all over my arms.\u2019\n\u2018Better than getting hair all over them like Mrs Gardener\u2019s Irene\u2019 said Miss Brewster.",
    "In\nanswer to Christine\u2019s inquiring glance she went on \u2018Mrs Gardener\u2019s been in grand form\nthis morning.",
    "Absolutely non\u2010stop.",
    "\u201cIsn\u2019t that so Odell\u201d \u201cYes darling.\u201d\u2019 She paused and\nthen said \u2018I wish though M. Poirot that you\u2019d played up to her a bit.",
    "Why didn\u2019t you\nWhy didn\u2019t you tell her that you were down here investigating a particularly gruesome\nmurder and that the murderer a homicidal maniac was certainly to be found among the\nguests of the hotel\u2019\nHercule Poirot sighed.",
    "He said \u2018I very much fear she would have believed me.\u2019\nMajor Barry gave a wheezy chuckle.",
    "He said \u2018She certainly would.\u2019\nEmily Brewster said \u2018No I don\u2019t believe even Mrs Gardener would have believed in a\ncrime staged here.",
    "This isn\u2019t the sort of place you\u2019d get a body\u2019\n10\n\n\fHercule Poirot stirred a little in his chair.",
    "He protested.",
    "He said \u2018But why not\nMademoiselle Why should there not be what you call a \u201cbody\u201d here on Smugglers\u2019\nIsland\u2019\nEmily Brewster said \u2018I don\u2019t know.",
    "I suppose some places are more unlikely than others.",
    "This isn\u2019t the kind of spot\u2014\u2019 She broke off finding it difficult to explain her meaning.",
    "\u2018It is romantic yes\u2019 agreed Hercule Poirot.",
    "\u2018It is peaceful.",
    "The sun shines.",
    "The sea is blue.",
    "But you forget Miss Brewster there is evil everywhere under the sun.\u2019\nThe clergyman stirred in his chair.",
    "He leaned forward.",
    "His intensely blue eyes lighted up.",
    "Miss Brewster shrugged her shoulders.",
    "\u2018Oh of course I realize that but all the same\u2014\u2019\n\u2018But all the same this still seems to you an unlikely setting for crime You forget one thing\nMademoiselle.\u2019\n\u2018Human nature I suppose\u2019\n\u2018That yes.",
    "That always.",
    "But that was not what I was going to say.",
    "I was going to point out\nto you that here everyone is on holiday.\u2019\nEmily Brewster turned a puzzled face to him.",
    "\u2018I don\u2019t understand.\u2019\nHercule Poirot beamed kindly at her.",
    "He made dabs in the air with an emphatic forefinger.",
    "\u2018Let us say you have an enemy.",
    "If you seek him out in his flat in his office in the street\u2014\neh bien you must have a reason\u2014you must account for yourself.",
    "But here at the seaside it\nis necessary for no one to account for himself.",
    "You are at Leathercombe Bay why\nParbleu it is August\u2014one goes to the seaside in August\u2014one is on one\u2019s holiday.",
    "It is\nquite natural you see for you to be here and for Mr Lane to be here and for Major Barry\nto be here and for Mrs Redfern and her husband to be here.",
    "Because it is the custom in\nEngland to go to the seaside in August.\u2019\n\u2018Well\u2019 admitted Miss Brewster \u2018that\u2019s certainly a very ingenious idea.",
    "But what about the\nGardeners They\u2019re American.\u2019\nPoirot smiled.",
    "\u2018Even Mrs Gardener as she told us feels the need to relax.",
    "Also since she is \u201cdoing\u201d\nEngland she must certainly spend a fortnight at the seaside\u2014as a good tourist if nothing\nelse.",
    "She enjoys watching people.\u2019\nMrs Redfern murmured \u2018You like watching the people too I think\u2019\n11\n\n\f\u2018Madame I will confess it.",
    "I do.\u2019\nShe said thoughtfully \u2018You see\u2014a good deal.\u2019\nIV\nThere was a pause.",
    "Stephen Lane cleared his throat and said with a trace of self\u2010\nconsciousness.",
    "\u2018I was interested M. Poirot in something you said just now.",
    "You said that there was evil\ndone everywhere under the sun.",
    "It was almost a quotation from Ecclesiastes.\u2019 He paused\nand then quoted himself \u2018Yea also the heart of the sons of men is full of evil and\nmadness is in their heart while they live.\u2019 His face lit up with an almost fanatical light.",
    "\u2018I\nwas glad to hear you say that.",
    "Nowadays no one believes in evil.",
    "It is considered at most\na mere negation of good.",
    "Evil people say is done by those who know no better\u2014who are\nundeveloped\u2014who are to be pitied rather than blamed.",
    "But M. Poirot evil is real It is a\nfact I believe in Evil like I believe in Good.",
    "It exists It is powerful It walks the earth\u2019\nHe stopped.",
    "His breath was coming fast.",
    "He wiped his forehead with his handkerchief and\nlooked suddenly apologetic.",
    "\u2018I\u2019m sorry.",
    "I got carried away.\u2019\nPoirot said calmly \u2018I understand your meaning.",
    "Up to a point I agree with you.",
    "Evil does\nwalk the earth and can be recognized as such.\u2019\nMajor Barry cleared his throat.",
    "\u2018Talking of that sort of thing some of these fakir fellers in India\u2014\u2019\nMajor Barry had been long enough at the Jolly Roger for everyone to be on their guard\nagainst his fatal tendency to embark on long Indian stories.",
    "Both Miss Brewster and Mrs\nRedfern burst into speech.",
    "\u2018That\u2019s your husband swimming in now isn\u2019t it Mrs Redfern How magnificent his crawl\nstroke is.",
    "He\u2019s an awfully good swimmer.\u2019\nAt the same moment Mrs Redfern said \u2018Oh look What a lovely little boat that is out there\nwith the red sails.",
    "It\u2019s Mr Blatt\u2019s isn\u2019t it\u2019\nThe sailing boat with the red sails was just crossing the end of the bay.",
    "Major Barry grunted \u2018Fanciful idea red sails\u2019 but the menace of the story about the fakir\nwas avoided.",
    "Hercule Poirot looked with appreciation at the young man who had just swum to shore.",
    "Patrick Redfern was a good specimen of humanity.",
    "Lean bronzed with broad shoulders\n12\n\n\fand narrow thighs there was about him a kind of infectious enjoyment and gaiety\u2014a\nnative simplicity that endeared him to all women and most men.",
    "He stood there shaking the water from him and raising a hand in gay salutation to his wife.",
    "She waved back calling out \u2018Come up here Pat.\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019m coming.\u2019\nHe went a little way along the beach to retrieve the towel he had left there.",
    "It was then that a woman came down past them from the hotel to the beach.",
    "Her arrival had all the importance of a stage entrance.",
    "Moreover she walked as though she knew it.",
    "There was no self\u2010consciousness apparent.",
    "It\nwould seem that she was too used to the invariable effect her presence produced.",
    "She was tall and slender.",
    "She wore a simple backless white bathing dress and every inch of\nher exposed body was tanned a beautiful even shade of bronze.",
    "She was as perfect as a\nstatue.",
    "Her hair was a rich flaming auburn curling richly and intimately into her neck.",
    "Her\nface had that slight hardness which is seen when thirty years have come and gone but the\nwhole effect of her was one of youth\u2014of superb and triumphant vitality.",
    "There was a\nChinese immobility about her face and an upward slant of the dark blue eyes.",
    "On her\nhead she wore a fantastic Chinese hat of jade green cardboard.",
    "There was that about her which made every other woman on the beach seem faded and\ninsignificant.",
    "And with equal inevitability the eye of every male present was drawn and\nriveted on her.",
    "The eyes of Hercule Poirot opened his moustache quivered appreciatively Major Barry\nsat up and his protuberant eyes bulged even farther with excitement on Poirot\u2019s left the\nReverend Stephen Lane drew in his breath with a little hiss and his figure stiffened.",
    "Major Barry said in a hoarse whisper \u2018Arlena Stuart that\u2019s who she was before she\nmarried Marshall\u2014I saw her in Come and Go before she left the stage.",

    "She was wearing a dress of some navy blue material with touches of white.",
    "It looked very\nsimple owing to the expensive severity of its line.",
    "Rosamund Darnley as Rose Mond Ltd\nwas one of London\u2019s best\u2010known dressmakers.",

    "That is\nright is it not\u2019\nShe nodded.",
    "Her foot swung to and fro.",
    "She stared down at it.",

    "But I\u2019d like to have gone on\u2014a different way.\u2019\nPoirot said \u2018I wonder.\u2019\nRosamund Darnley laughed.",
    "\u2018So do I really\u2019\nPoirot said \u2018When I was young and that Mademoiselle is indeed a long time ago there\nwas a game entitled \u201cIf not yourself who would you be\u201d One wrote the answer in young\nladies\u2019 albums.",
    "They had gold edges and were bound in blue leather.",

    "\u2018That shows doesn\u2019t it that you never know\u2019\nAfter a moment or two Poirot said \u2018Many people Mademoiselle must envy you.\u2019\nRosamund Darnley said coolly \u2018Oh yes.",
    "Naturally.\u2019\nShe thought about it her lips curved upward in their ironic smile.",
    "\u2018Yes I\u2019m really the perfect type of the successful woman I enjoy the artistic satisfaction of\nthe successful creative artist I really do like designing clothes and the financial\nsatisfaction of the successful business woman.",

    "It is from choice not necessity that you remain single.\u2019\nRosamund Darnley said \u2018And yet like all men I\u2019m sure you believe in your heart that no\nwoman is content unless she is married and has children.\u2019\n18\n\n\fPoirot shrugged his shoulders.",
    "\u2018To marry and have children that is the common lot of women.",
    "Only one woman in a\nhundred\u2014more in a thousand can make for herself a name and a position as you have\ndone.\u2019\nRosamund grinned at him.",
    "\u2018And yet all the same I\u2019m nothing but a wretched old maid That\u2019s what I feel today at\nany rate.",
    "I\u2019d be happier with twopence a year and a big silent brute of a husband and a\nbrood of brats running after me.",
    "That\u2019s true isn\u2019t it\u2019\nPoirot shrugged his shoulders.",
    "\u2018Since you say so then yes Mademoiselle.\u2019\nRosamund laughed her equilibrium suddenly restored.",
    "She took out a cigarette and lit it.",
    "She said \u2018You certainly know how to deal with women M. Poirot.",
    "I now feel like taking the\nopposite point of view and arguing with you in favour of careers for women.",
    "Of course I\u2019m\ndamned well off as I am\u2014and I know it\u2019\n\u2018Then everything in the garden\u2014or shall we say at the seaside is lovely Mademoiselle.\u2019\n\u2018Quite right.\u2019\nPoirot in his turn extracted his cigarette case and lit one of those tiny cigarettes which it\nwas his affection to smoke.",
    "Regarding the ascending haze with a quizzical eye he murmured \u2018So Mr\u2014no Captain\nMarshall is an old friend of yours Mademoiselle\u2019\nRosamund sat up.",
    "She said \u2018Now how do you know that Oh I suppose Ken told you.\u2019\nPoirot shook his head.",
    "\u2018Nobody has told me anything.",
    "After all Mademoiselle I am a detective.",
    "It was the\nobvious conclusion to draw.\u2019\nRosamund Darnley said \u2018I don\u2019t see it.\u2019\n\u2018But consider\u2019 The little man\u2019s hands were eloquent.",
    "\u2018You have been here a week.",
    "You are\nlively gay without a care.",
    "Today suddenly you speak of ghosts of old times.",
    "What has\nhappened For several days there have been no new arrivals until last night when Captain\nMarshall and his wife and daughter arrive.",
    "Today the change It is obvious\u2019\nRosamund Darnley said \u2018Well it\u2019s true enough.",
    "Kenneth Marshall and I were more or less\nchildren together.",
    "The Marshalls lived next door to us.",
    "Ken was always nice to me\u2014\n19\n\n\falthough condescending of course since he was four years older.",
    "I\u2019ve not seen anything\nof him for a long time.",
    "It must be\u2014fifteen years at least.\u2019\nPoirot said thoughtfully \u2018A long time.\u2019\nRosamund nodded.",
    "There was a pause and then Hercule Poirot said \u2018He is sympathetic yes\u2019\nRosamund said warmly \u2018Ken\u2019s a dear.",
    "One of the best.",
    "Frightfully quiet and reserved.",
    "I\u2019d\nsay his only fault is a penchant for making unfortunate marriages.\u2019\nPoirot said in a tone of great understanding \u2018Ah\u2014\u2019\nRosamund Darnley went on.",
    "\u2018Kenneth\u2019s a fool\u2014an utter fool where women are concerned Do you remember the\nMartingdale case\u2019\nPoirot frowned.",

    "Seventeen or eighteen years ago.",
    "The woman was tried for the murder of her\nhusband.\u2019\n\u2018And he was proved to have been an arsenic eater and she was acquitted\u2019\n\u2018That\u2019s right.",
    "Well after her acquittal Ken married her.",
    "That\u2019s the sort of damn silly thing\nhe does.\u2019\nHercule Poirot murmured \u2018But if she was innocent\u2019\nRosamund Darnley said impatiently \u2018Oh I dare say she was innocent.",
    "Nobody really\nknows But there are plenty of women to marry in the world without going out of your\nway to marry one who\u2019s stood her trial for murder.\u2019\nPoirot said nothing.",
    "Perhaps he knew that if he kept silence Rosamund Darnley would go\non.",
    "She did so.",
    "\u2018He was very young of course only just twenty\u2010one.",
    "He was crazy about her.",
    "She died\nwhen Linda was born\u2014a year after their marriage.",
    "I believe Ken was terribly cut up by her\ndeath.",
    "Afterwards he racketed around a lot\u2014trying to forget I suppose.\u2019\nShe paused.",
    "\u2018And then came this business of Arlena Stuart.",
    "She was in Revue at the time.",
    "There was\nthe Codrington divorce case.",
    "Lady Codrington divorced Codrington citing Arlena Stuart.",
    "20\n\n\fThey say Lord Codrington was absolutely infatuated with her.",
    "It was understood they were\nto be married as soon as the decree was made absolute.",
    "Actually when it came to it he\ndidn\u2019t marry her.",
    "Turned her down flat.",
    "I believe she actually sued him for breach of\npromise.",
    "Anyway the thing made a big stir at the time.",
    "The next thing that happens is that\nKen goes and marries her.",
    "The fool\u2014the complete fool\u2019\nHercule Poirot murmured \u2018A man might be excused such a folly\u2014she is beautiful\nMademoiselle.\u2019\n\u2018Yes there\u2019s no doubt of that.",
    "There was another scandal about three years ago.",
    "Old Sir\nRoger Erskine left her every penny of his money.",
    "I should have thought that would have\nopened Ken\u2019s eyes if anything would.\u2019\n\u2018And did it not\u2019\nRosamund Darnley shrugged her shoulders.",
    "\u2018I tell you I\u2019ve seen nothing of him for years.",
    "People say though that he took it with\nabsolute equanimity.",
    "Why I should like to know Has he got an absolutely blind belief in\nher\u2019\nThere might be other reasons.\u2019\n\u2018Yes.",

    "And a man\u2010eater as well If anything\npersonable in trousers comes within a hundred yards of her it\u2019s fresh sport for Arlena\nShe\u2019s that kind.\u2019\nPoirot nodded his head slowly in complete agreement.",

    "Now Linda\ncame to think of it she\u2019d very seldom heard him laugh.",
    "She felt puzzled.",
    "It was as though she\u2019d got a glimpse of quite a different person.",
    "She\nthought\n\u2018I wonder what Father was like when he was my age...\u2019\nBut that was too difficult.",
    "She gave it up.",
    "An idea flashed across her mind.",

    "I thought he was rather\na pet.\u2019\n\u2018So I gather.",
    "Did you know that he and his wife were coming down here\u2019\nArlena opened her eyes very wide.",
    "\u2018Oh no darling.",
    "It was the greatest surprise\u2019\nKenneth Marshall said quietly \u2018I thought perhaps that that was what put the idea of this\nplace into your head.",
    "You were very keen we should come here.\u2019\nArlena put down the mascara.",
    "She turned towards him.",
    "She smiled\u2014a soft seductive\nsmile.",
    "She said \u2018Somebody told me about this place.",
    "I think it was the Rylands.",
    "They said it\nwas simply too marvellous\u2014so unspoilt Don\u2019t you like it\u2019\nKenneth Marshall said \u2018I\u2019m not sure.\u2019\n\u2018Oh darling but you adore bathing and lazing about.",
    "I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll simply adore it here.\u2019\n\u2018I can see that you mean to enjoy yourself.\u2019\nHer eyes widened a little.",

    "I know what you\u2019re like.",
    "They\u2019re rather a nice\nyoung couple.",
    "That boy\u2019s fond of his wife really.",
    "Must you upset the whole blinking\nshow\u2019\nArlena said \u2018It\u2019s so unfair blaming me.",

    "\u2018Well of course.",
    "I know people do go crazy about me.",
    "But it\u2019s not my doing.",
    "They just get\nlike that.\u2019\n25\n\n\f\u2018So you do admit that young Redfern is crazy about you\u2019\nArlena murmured \u2018It\u2019s really rather stupid of him.\u2019\nShe moved a step towards her husband.",
    "\u2018But you know don\u2019t you Ken that I don\u2019t really care for anyone but you\u2019\nShe looked up at him through her darkened lashes.",

    "There was also a path that led off round the cliff on the\nsouth\u2010west side of the island.",
    "A little way along it a few steps led down to a series of\nrecesses cut into the cliff and labelled on the hotel map of the island as Sunny Ledge.",
    "Here\ncut out of the cliff were niches with seats in them.",
    "To one of these immediately after dinner came Patrick Redfern and his wife.",
    "It was a\nlovely clear night with a bright moon.",
    "The Redferns sat down.",
    "For a while they were silent.",
    "At last Patrick Redfern said \u2018It\u2019s a glorious evening isn\u2019t it Christine\u2019\n\u2018Yes.\u2019\nSomething in her voice may have made him uneasy.",
    "He sat without looking at her.",
    "Christine Redfern asked in her quiet voice \u2018Did you know that woman was going to be\nhere\u2019\nHe turned sharply.",
    "He said \u2018I don\u2019t know what you mean.\u2019\n\u2018I think you do.\u2019\n\u2018Look here Christine.",
    "I don\u2019t know what has come over you\u2014\u2019\nShe interrupted.",
    "Her voice held feeling now.",
    "It trembled.",
    "\u2018Over me It\u2019s what has come over you\u2019\n\u2018Nothing\u2019s come over me.\u2019\n26\n\n\f\u2018Oh Patrick it has You insisted so on coming here.",
    "You were quite vehement.",
    "I wanted to\ngo to Tintagel again where\u2014where we had our honeymoon.",
    "You were bent on coming\nhere.\u2019\n\u2018Well why not It\u2019s a fascinating spot.\u2019\n\u2018Perhaps.",
    "But you wanted to come here because she was going to be here.\u2019\n\u2018She Who is she\u2019\n\u2018Mrs Marshall.",
    "You\u2014you\u2019re infatuated with her.\u2019\n\u2018For God\u2019s sake Christine don\u2019t make a fool of yourself.",
    "It\u2019s not like you to be jealous.\u2019\nHis bluster was a little uncertain.",
    "He exaggerated it.",
    "She said \u2018We\u2019ve been so happy.\u2019\n\u2018Happy Of course we\u2019ve been happy We are happy.",
    "But we shan\u2019t go on being happy if I\ncan\u2019t even speak to another woman without you kicking up a row.\u2019\n\u2018It\u2019s not like that.\u2019\n\u2018Yes it is.",
    "In marriage one has got to have\u2014well\u2014friendships with other people.",
    "This\nsuspicious attitude is all wrong.",

    "He shrugged his shoulders.",

    "She\u2019ll do you harm Patrick please give it up.",
    "Let\u2019s go away from here.\u2019\nPatrick Redfern stuck out his chin mutinously.",

    "Come on let\u2019s go back to the hotel.\u2019\n27\n\n\fHe got up.",
    "There was a pause then Christine Redfern got up too.",
    "She said \u2018Very well...\u2019\nIn the recess adjoining on the seat there Hercule Poirot sat and shook his head\nsorrowfully.",
    "Some people might have scrupulously removed themselves from earshot of a private\nconversation.",
    "But not Hercule Poirot.",
    "He had no scruples of that kind.",
    "\u2018Besides\u2019 as he explained to his friend Hastings at a later date \u2018it was a question of\nmurder.\u2019\nHastings said staring \u2018But the murder hadn\u2019t happened then.\u2019\nHercule Poirot sighed.",
    "He said \u2018But already mon cher it was very clearly indicated.\u2019\n\u2018Then why didn\u2019t you stop it\u2019\nAnd Hercule Poirot with a sigh said as he had said once before in Egypt that if a person is\ndetermined to commit murder it is not easy to prevent them.",
    "He does not blame himself\nfor what happened.",
    "It was according to him inevitable.",
    "28\n\n\fChapter 3\nRosamund Darnley and Kenneth Marshall sat on the short springy turf of the cliff\noverlooking Gull Cove.",
    "This was on the east side of the island.",
    "People came here in the\nmorning sometimes to bathe when they wanted to be peaceful.",
    "Rosamund said \u2018It\u2019s nice to get away from people.\u2019\nMarshall murmured inaudibly \u2018M\u2014m yes.\u2019\nHe rolled over sniffing at the short turf.",
    "\u2018Smells good.",
    "Remember the downs at Shipley\u2019\n\u2018Rather.\u2019\n\u2018Pretty good those days.\u2019\n\u2018Yes.\u2019\n\u2018You\u2019ve not changed much Rosamund.\u2019\n\u2018Yes I have.",

    "It\u2019s a pity isn\u2019t it Kenneth that we can\u2019t keep the nice natures and high ideals\nthat we had when we were young\u2019\n\u2018I don\u2019t know that your nature was ever particularly nice my child.",
    "You used to get into\nthe most frightful rages.",
    "You half\u2010choked me once when you flew at me in a temper.\u2019\nRosamund laughed.",
    "She said \u2018Do you remember the day that we took Toby down to get\nwater rats\u2019\nThey spent some minutes in recalling old adventures.",
    "Then there came a pause.",
    "Rosamund\u2019s fingers played with the clasp of her bag.",

    "She said \u2018Yes\u2014yes\u2014I have felt\u2014just that...\u2019\nIV\nMr Blatt said \u2018So you\u2019re the famous sleuth eh\u2019\nThey were in the cocktail bar a favourite haunt of Mr Blatt\u2019s.",
    "Hercule Poirot acknowledged the remark with his usual lack of modesty.",
    "Mr Blatt went on.",
    "\u2018And what are you doing down here\u2014on a job\u2019\n\u2018No no.",
    "I repose myself.",
    "I take the holiday.\u2019\nMr Blatt winked.",
    "\u2018You\u2019d say that anyway wouldn\u2019t you\u2019\nPoirot replied \u2018Not necessarily.\u2019\nHorace Blatt said \u2018Oh Come now.",
    "As a matter of fact you\u2019d be safe enough with me.",
    "I\ndon\u2019t repeat all I hear Learnt to keep my mouth shut years ago.",
    "Shouldn\u2019t have got on the\nway I have if I hadn\u2019t known how to do that.",
    "But you know what most people are\u2014yap\nyap yap about everything they hear Now you can\u2019t afford that in your trade That\u2019s why\nyou\u2019ve got to keep it up that you\u2019re here holiday\u2010making and nothing else.\u2019\nPoirot asked \u2018And why should you suppose the contrary\u2019\n34\n\n\fMr Blatt closed one eye.",
    "He said \u2018I\u2019m a man of the world.",
    "I know the cut of a fellow\u2019s jib.",
    "A man like you would be\nat Deauville or Le Touquet or down at Juan les Pins.",
    "That\u2019s your\u2014what\u2019s the phrase\u2014\nspiritual home.\u2019\nPoirot sighed.",
    "He looked out of the window.",
    "Rain was falling and mist encircled the island.",
    "He said \u2018It is possible that you are right There at least in wet weather there are the\ndistractions.\u2019\n\u2018Good old Casino\u2019 said Mr Blatt.",
    "\u2018You know I\u2019ve had to work pretty hard most of my life.",
    "No time for holidays or kickshaws.",
    "I meant to make good and I have made good.",
    "Now I can\ndo what I please.",
    "My money\u2019s as good as any man\u2019s.",
    "I\u2019ve seen a bit of life in the last few\nyears I can tell you.\u2019\nPoirot murmured \u2018Ah yes\u2019\n\u2018Don\u2019t know why I came to this place\u2019 Mr Blatt continued.",
    "Poirot observed \u2018I too wondered\u2019\n\u2018Eh what\u2019s that\u2019\nPoirot waved an eloquent hand.",
    "\u2018I too am not without observation.",
    "I should have expected you most certainly to choose\nDeauville or Biarritz.\u2019\n\u2018Instead of which we\u2019re both here eh\u2019\nMr Blatt gave a hoarse chuckle.",
    "\u2018Don\u2019t really know why I came here\u2019 he mused.",
    "\u2018I think you know it sounded romantic.",
    "Jolly Roger Hotel Smugglers\u2019 Island.",
    "That kind of address tickles you up you know.",
    "Makes\nyou think of when you were a boy.",
    "Pirates smuggling all that.\u2019\nHe laughed rather self\u2010consciously.",
    "\u2018I used to sail quite a bit as a boy.",
    "Not this part of the world.",
    "Off the East coast.",
    "Funny how\na taste for that sort of thing never quite leaves you.",
    "I could have a tip\u2010top yacht if I liked\nbut somehow I don\u2019t really fancy it.",
    "I like mucking about in that little yawl of mine.",
    "Redfern\u2019s keen on sailing too.",
    "He\u2019s been out with me once or twice.",
    "Can\u2019t get hold of him\nnow\u2014always hanging round that red\u2010haired wife of Marshall\u2019s.\u2019\nHe paused then lowering his voice he went on \u2018Mostly a dried up lot of sticks in this\nhotel Mrs Marshall\u2019s about the only lively spot I should think Marshall\u2019s got his hands full\nlooking after her.",
    "All sorts of stories about her in her stage days\u2014and after Men go crazy\nabout her.",
    "You\u2019ll see there\u2019ll be a spot of trouble one of these days.\u2019\n35\n\n\fPoirot asked \u2018What kind of trouble\u2019\nHorace Blatt replied \u2018That depends.",
    "I\u2019d say looking at Marshall that he\u2019s a man with a\nfunny kind of temper.",
    "As a matter of fact I know he is.",
    "Heard something about him.",
    "I\u2019ve\nmet that quiet sort.",
    "Never know where you are with that kind.",
    "Redfern had better look\nout\u2014\u2019\nHe broke off as the subject of his words came into the bar.",
    "He went on speaking loudly\nand self\u2010consciously.",
    "\u2018And as I say sailing round this coast is good fun.",
    "Hullo Redfern have one with me\nWhat\u2019ll you have Dry Martini Right.",
    "What about you M. Poirot\u2019\nPoirot shook his head.",
    "Patrick Redfern sat down and said \u2018Sailing It\u2019s the best fun in the world.",
    "Wish I could do\nmore of it.",
    "Used to spend most of my time as a boy in a sailing dinghy round this coast.\u2019\nPoirot said \u2018Then you know this part of the world well\u2019\n\u2018Rather I knew this place before there was a hotel on it.",
    "There were just a few fishermen\u2019s\ncottages at Leathercombe Bay and a tumbledown old house all shut up on the island.\u2019\n\u2018There was a house here\u2019\n\u2018Oh yes but it hadn\u2019t been lived in for years.",
    "Was practically falling down.",
    "There used to\nbe all sorts of stories of secret passages from the house to Pixy\u2019s Cave.",
    "We were always\nlooking for that secret passage I remember.\u2019\nHorace Blatt spilt his drink.",
    "He cursed mopped himself and asked \u2018What is this Pixy\u2019s\nCave\u2019\nPatrick said \u2018Oh don\u2019t you know it It\u2019s on Pixy Cove.",
    "You can\u2019t find the entrance to it\neasily.",
    "It\u2019s among a lot of piled up boulders at one end.",
    "Just a long thin crack.",
    "You can just\nsqueeze through it.",
    "Inside it widens out into quite a big cave.",
    "You can imagine what fun it\nwas to a boy An old fisherman showed it to me.",
    "Nowadays even the fishermen don\u2019t\nknow about it.",
    "I asked one the other day why the place was called Pixy Cove and he\ncouldn\u2019t tell me.\u2019\nHercule Poirot said \u2018But I still do not understand.",
    "What is this pixy\u2019\nPatrick Redfern said \u2018Oh that\u2019s typically Devonshire.",
    "There\u2019s the pixy\u2019s cave at Sheepstor\non the Moor.",
    "You\u2019re supposed to leave a pin you know as a present for the pixy.",
    "A pixy is\na kind of moor spirit.\u2019\nHercule Poirot said \u2018Ah but it is interesting that.\u2019\nPatrick Redfern went on.",
    "36\n\n\f\u2018There\u2019s a lot of pixy lore on Dartmoor still.",
    "There are tors that are said to pixy ridden and\nI expect that farmers coming home after a thick night still complain of being pixy led.\u2019\nHorace Blatt said \u2018You mean when they\u2019ve had a couple\u2019\nPatrick Redfern said with a smile \u2018That\u2019s certainly the commonsense explanation\u2019\nBlatt looked at his watch.",
    "He said \u2018I\u2019m going in to dinner.",
    "On the whole Redfern pirates\nare my favourites not pixies.\u2019\nPatrick Redfern said with a laugh as the other went out \u2018Faith I\u2019d like to see the old boy\npixy led himself\u2019\nPoirot observed meditatively \u2018For a hard\u2010bitten business man M. Blatt seems to have a\nvery romantic imagination.\u2019\nPatrick Redfern said \u2018That\u2019s because he\u2019s only half educated.",
    "Or so my wife says.",
    "Look at\nwhat he reads Nothing but thrillers or Wild West stories.\u2019\nPoirot said \u2018You mean that he has still the mentality of a boy\u2019\n\u2018Well don\u2019t you think so sir\u2019\n\u2018Me I have not seen very much of him.\u2019\n\u2018I haven\u2019t either.",
    "I\u2019ve been out sailing with him once or twice\u2014but he doesn\u2019t really like\nhaving anyone with him.",
    "He prefers to be on his own.\u2019\nHercule Poirot said \u2018That is indeed curious.",
    "It is singularly unlike his practice on land.\u2019\nRedfern laughed.",
    "He said \u2018I know.",
    "We all have a bit of trouble keeping out of his way.",
    "He\u2019d\nlike to turn this place into a cross between Margate and Le Touquet.\u2019\nPoirot said nothing for a minute or two.",
    "He was studying the laughing face of his\ncompanion very attentively.",
    "He said suddenly and unexpectedly \u2018I think M. Redfern that\nyou enjoy living.\u2019\nPatrick stared at him surprised.",
    "\u2018Indeed I do.",
    "Why not\u2019\n\u2018Why not indeed\u2019 agreed Poirot.",
    "\u2018I make you my felicitation on the fact.\u2019\nSmiling a little Patrick Redfern said \u2018Thank you sir.\u2019\n\u2018That is why as an older man a very much older man I venture to offer you a piece of\nadvice.\u2019\n37\n\n\f\u2018Yes sir\u2019\n\u2018A very wise friend of mine in the Police Force said to me years ago \u201cHercule my friend if\nyou would know tranquillity avoid women.\u201d\u2019\nPatrick Redfern said \u2018I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s a bit late for that sir.",
    "I\u2019m married you know.\u2019\n\u2018I do know.",
    "Your wife is a very charming a very accomplished woman.",
    "She is I think very\nfond of you.\u2019\nPatrick Redfern said sharply \u2018I\u2019m very fond of her.\u2019\n\u2018Ah\u2019 said Hercule Poirot \u2018I am delighted to hear it.\u2019\nPatrick\u2019s brow was suddenly like thunder.",
    "\u2018Look here M. Poirot what are you getting at\u2019\n\u2018Les Femmes.\u2019 Poirot leaned back and closed his eyes.",
    "\u2018I know something of them.",
    "They\nare capable of complicating life unbearably.",
    "And the English they conduct their affairs\nindescribably.",
    "If it was necessary for you to come here M. Redfern why in the name of\nheaven did you bring your wife\u2019\nPatrick Redfern said angrily \u2018I don\u2019t know what you mean.\u2019\nHercule Poirot said calmly \u2018You know perfectly.",
    "I am not so foolish as to argue with an\ninfatuated man.",
    "I utter only the word of caution.\u2019\n\u2018You\u2019ve been listening to these damned scandal\u2010mongers.",
    "Mrs Gardener the Brewster\nwoman\u2014nothing to do but to clack their tongues all day.",
    "Just because a woman\u2019s good\u2010\nlooking\u2014they\u2019re down on her like a sack of coals.\u2019\nHercule Poirot got up.",
    "He murmured \u2018Are you really as young as all that\u2019\nShaking his head he left the bar.",
    "Patrick Redfern stared angrily after him.",
    "V\nHercule Poirot paused in the hall on his way from the dining\u2010room.",
    "The doors were open\u2014\na breath of soft night air came in.",
    "The rain had stopped and the mist had dispersed.",
    "It was a fine night again.",
    "Hercule Poirot found Mrs Redfern in her favourite seat on the cliff ledge.",
    "He stopped by\nher and said \u2018This seat is damp.",
    "You should not sit here.",
    "You will catch the chill.\u2019\n\u2018No I shan\u2019t.",
    "And what does it matter anyway.\u2019\n38\n\n\f\u2018Tscha tscha you are not a child You are an educated woman.",
    "You must look at things\nsensibly.\u2019\nShe said coldly \u2018I can assure you I never take cold.\u2019\nPoirot said \u2018It has been a wet day.",
    "The wind blew the rain came down and the mist was\neverywhere so that one could not see through it.",
    "Eh bien what is it like now The mists\nhave rolled away the sky is clear and up above the stars shine.",
    "That is like life Madame.\u2019\nChristine said in a low fierce voice \u2018Do you know what I am most sick of in this place\u2019\n\u2018What Madame\u2019\n\u2018Pity.\u2019\nShe brought the word out like the flick of a whip.",
    "She went on \u2018Do you think I don\u2019t know That I can\u2019t see All the time people are saying\n\u201cPoor Mrs Redfern\u2014that poor little woman.\u201d And anyway I\u2019m not little I\u2019m tall.",
    "They say\nlittle because they are sorry for me.",
    "And I can\u2019t bear it\u2019\nCautiously Hercule Poirot spread his handkerchief on the seat and sat down.",
    "He said\nthoughtfully \u2018There is something in that.\u2019\n\u2018That woman\u2014\u2019 said Christine and stopped.",
    "Poirot said gravely \u2018Will you allow me to tell you something Madame Something that is\nas true as the stars above us The Arlena Stuarts\u2014or Arlena Marshalls\u2014of this world\u2014do\nnot count.\u2019\nChristine Redfern said \u2018Nonsense.\u2019\n\u2018I assure you it is true.",
    "Their Empire is of the moment and for the moment.",
    "To count\u2014\nreally and truly to count\u2014a woman must have goodness or brains.\u2019\nChristine said scornfully \u2018Do you think men care for goodness or brains\u2019\nPoirot said gravely \u2018Fundamentally yes.\u2019\nChristine laughed shortly.",
    "\u2018I don\u2019t agree with you.\u2019\nPoirot said \u2018Your husband loves you Madame.",
    "I know it.\u2019\n\u2018You can\u2019t know it.\u2019\n\u2018Yes yes.",
    "I know it.",

    "She wept stormily and bitterly against Poirot\u2019s accommodating\nshoulder.",
    "She said \u2018I can\u2019t bear it...I can\u2019t bear it...\u2019\nPoirot patted her arm.",
    "He said soothingly \u2018Patience\u2014only patience.\u2019\nShe sat up and pressed her handkerchief to her eyes.",
    "She said in a stifled voice \u2018It\u2019s all\nright.",
    "I\u2019m better now.",
    "Leave me.",
    "I\u2019d\u2014I\u2019d rather be alone.\u2019\nHe obeyed and left her sitting there while he himself followed the winding path down to\nthe hotel.",
    "He was nearly there when he heard the murmur of voices.",
    "He turned a little aside from the path.",
    "There was a gap in the bushes.",
    "He saw Arlena Marshall and Patrick Redfern beside her.",
    "He heard the man\u2019s voice with\nthe throb in it of emotion.",
    "\u2018I\u2019m crazy about you\u2014crazy\u2014you\u2019ve driven me mad...You do care a little\u2014you do care\u2019\nHe saw Arlena Marshall\u2019s face\u2014it was he thought like a sleek happy cat\u2014it was animal\nnot human.",
    "She said softly \u2018Of course Patrick darling I adore you.",
    "You know that...\u2019\nFor once Hercule Poirot cut his eavesdropping short.",
    "He went back to the path and on\ndown to the hotel.",
    "A figure joined him suddenly.",
    "It was Captain Marshall.",
    "Marshall said \u2018Remarkable night what After that foul day.\u2019 He looked up at the sky.",
    "\u2018Looks as though we should have fine weather tomorrow.\u2019\n\n40\n\n\fChapter 4\nThe morning of the 25th of August dawned bright and cloudless.",
    "It was a morning to\ntempt even an inveterate sluggard to rise early.",
    "Several people rose early that morning at the Jolly Roger.",
    "It was eight o\u2019clock when Linda sitting at her dressing\u2010table turned a little thick calf\nbound volume face downwards sprawling it open and looked at her own face in the\nmirror.",
    "Her lips were set tight together and the pupils of her eyes contracted.",
    "She said below her breath \u2018I\u2019ll do it...\u2019\nShe slipped out of her pyjamas and into her bathing\u2010dress.",
    "Over it she flung on a bath\u2010\nrobe and laced espadrilles on her feet.",
    "She went out of her room and along the passage.",
    "At the end of it a door on to the balcony\nled to an outside staircase leading directly down to the rocks below the hotel.",
    "There was a\nsmall iron ladder clamped on to the rocks leading down into the water which was used by\nmany of the hotel guests for a before\u2010breakfast dip as taking up less time than going down\nto the main bathing beach.",
    "As Linda started down from the balcony she met her father coming up.",
    "He said \u2018You\u2019re up\nearly.",
    "Going to have a dip\u2019\nLinda nodded.",
    "They passed each other.",
    "Instead of going on down the rocks however Linda skirted round the hotel to the left\nuntil she came to the path down to the causeway connecting the hotel with the mainland.",
    "The tide was high and the causeway under water but the boat that took hotel guests\nacross was tied to a little jetty.",
    "The man in charge of it was absent at the moment.",
    "Linda\ngot in untied it and rowed herself across.",
    "She tied up the boat on the other side walked up the slope past the hotel garage and\nalong until she reached the general shop.",
    "The woman had just taken down the shutters and was engaged in sweeping out the floor.",
    "She looked amazed at the sight of Linda.",
    "\u2018Well Miss you are up early.\u2019\nLinda put her hand in the pocket of her bath\u2010wrap and brought out some money.",
    "She\nproceeded to make her purchases.",
    "41\n\n\fII\nChristine Redfern was standing in Linda\u2019s room when the girl returned.",
    "\u2018Oh there you are\u2019 Christine exclaimed.",
    "\u2018I thought you couldn\u2019t be really up yet.\u2019\nLinda said \u2018No I\u2019ve been bathing.\u2019\nNoticing the parcel in her hand Christine said with surprise \u2018The post has come early\ntoday.\u2019\nLinda flushed.",
    "With her habitual nervous clumsiness the parcel slipped from her hand.",
    "The\nflimsy string broke and some of the contents rolled over the floor.",
    "Christine exclaimed \u2018What have you been buying candles for\u2019\nBut to Linda\u2019s relief she did not wait for an answer but went on as she helped to pick the\nthings up from the floor.",
    "\u2018I came in to ask whether you would like to come with me to Gull Cove this morning.",
    "I\nwant to sketch there.\u2019\nLinda accepted with alacrity.",
    "In the last few days she had accompanied Christine Redfern more than once on sketching\nexpeditions.",
    "Christine was a most indifferent artist but it is possible that she found the\nexcuse of painting a help to her pride since her husband now spent most of his time with\nArlena Marshall.",
    "Linda Marshall had been increasingly morose and bad tempered.",
    "She liked being with\nChristine who intent on her work spoke very little.",
    "It was Linda felt nearly as good as\nbeing by oneself and in a curious way she craved for company of some kind.",
    "There was a\nsubtle kind of sympathy between her and the elder woman probably based on the fact of\ntheir mutual dislike of the same person.",
    "Christine said \u2018I\u2019m playing tennis at twelve so we\u2019d better start fairly early.",
    "Half\u2010past ten\u2019\n\u2018Right.",
    "I\u2019ll be ready.",

    "\u2018You\u2019re not feverish are you Linda\u2019\nThe girls\u2019 eyes were very bright and she had a vivid patch of colour in each cheek.",
    "\u2018Oh no.",
    "I\u2019m never feverish.\u2019\nRosamund smiled and said \u2018It\u2019s such a lovely day I got up for breakfast.",
    "Usually I have it in\nbed.",
    "But today I came down and faced eggs and bacon like a man.\u2019\n\u2018I know\u2014it\u2019s heavenly after yesterday.",
    "Gull Cove is nice in the morning.",
    "I shall put a lot of\noil on and get really brown.\u2019\nRosamund said \u2018Yes Gull Cove is nice in the morning.",
    "And it\u2019s more peaceful than the\nbeach here.\u2019\nLinda said rather shyly \u2018Come too.\u2019\nRosamund shook her head.",
    "She said \u2018Not this morning.",
    "I\u2019ve other fish to fry.\u2019\nChristine Redfern came down the stairs.",
    "She was wearing beach pyjamas of a loose floppy pattern with long sleeves and wide legs.",
    "They were made of some green material with a yellow design.",
    "Rosamund\u2019s tongue itched\nto tell her that yellow and green were the most unbecoming colours possible for her fair\nslightly anaemic complexion.",
    "It always annoyed Rosamund when people had no clothes\nsense.",
    "She thought \u2018If I dressed that girl I\u2019d soon make her husband sit up and take notice.",
    "However much of a fool Arlena is she does know how to dress.",
    "This wretched girl looks\njust like a wilting lettuce.\u2019\nAloud she said \u2018Have a nice time.",
    "I\u2019m going to Sunny Ledge with a book.\u2019\nIV\nHercule Poirot breakfasted in his room as usual off coffee and rolls.",
    "43\n\n\fThe beauty of the morning however tempted him to leave the hotel earlier than usual.",

    "She thanked him with one of those sideways glances of hers.",
    "Just as she was pushing off she called him.",
    "\u2018M.",
    "Poirot\u2019\nPoirot leaped to the water\u2019s edge.",
    "\u2018Madame.\u2019\nArlena Marshall said \u2018Do something for me will you\u2019\n\u2018Anything.\u2019\nShe smiled at him.",

    "\u2018Every one will follow me about so.",
    "I just want for once to be alone.\u2019\nShe paddled off vigorously.",
    "Poirot walked up the beach.",
    "He murmured to himself \u2018Ah \u00e7a jamais That par exemple I\ndo not believe.\u2019\nHe doubted if Arlena Stuart to give her her stage name had ever wanted to be alone in\nher life.",
    "Hercule Poirot that man of the world knew better.",
    "Arlena Marshall was doubtless\nkeeping a rendezvous and Poirot had a very good idea with whom.",
    "Or thought he had but there he found himself proved wrong.",
    "For just as she floated rounded the point of the bay and disappeared out of sight Patrick\nRedfern closely followed by Kenneth Marshall came striding down the beach from the\nhotel.",
    "Marshall nodded to Poirot \u2019Morning Poirot.",
    "Seen my wife anywhere about\u2019\nPoirot\u2019s answer was diplomatic.",
    "44\n\n\f\u2018Has Madame then risen so early\u2019\nMarshall said \u2018She\u2019s not in her room.\u2019 He looked up at the sky.",
    "\u2018Lovely day.",
    "I shall have a\nbathe right away.",
    "Got a lot of typing to do this morning.\u2019\nPatrick Redfern less openly was looking up and down the beach.",
    "He sat down near Poirot\nand prepared to wait for the arrival of his lady.",
    "Poirot said \u2018And Madame Redfern Has she too risen early\u2019\nPatrick Redfern said \u2018Christine Oh she\u2019s going off sketching.",
    "She\u2019s rather keen on art just\nnow.\u2019\nHe spoke impatiently his mind clearly elsewhere.",
    "As time passed he displayed his\nimpatience for Arlena\u2019s arrival only too crudely.",
    "At every footstep he turned an eager head\nto see who it was coming down from the hotel.",
    "Disappointment followed disappointment.",
    "First Mr and Mrs Gardener complete with knitting and book and then Miss Brewster\narrived.",
    "Mrs Gardener industrious as ever settled herself in her chair and began to knit\nvigorously and talk at the same time.",
    "\u2018Well.",
    "M. Poirot.",
    "The beach seems very deserted this morning.",
    "Where is everybody\u2019\nPoirot replied that the Mastermans and the Cowans two families with young people in\nthem had gone off on an all\u2010day sailing excursion.",
    "\u2018Why that certainly does make all the difference not having them about laughing and\ncalling out.",
    "And only one person bathing Captain Marshall.\u2019\nMarshall had just finished his swim.",
    "He came up the beach swinging his towel.",
    "\u2018Pretty good in the sea this morning\u2019 he said.",
    "\u2018Unfortunately I\u2019ve got a lot of work to do.",
    "Must go and get on with it.\u2019\n\u2018Why if that isn\u2019t too bad Captain Marshall.",
    "On a beautiful day like this too.",
    "My wasn\u2019t\nyesterday too terrible I said to Mr Gardener that if the weather was going to continue\nlike that we\u2019d just have to leave.",
    "It\u2019s the melancholy you know with the mist right up\naround the island.",
    "Gives you a kind of ghostly feeling but then I\u2019ve always been very\nsusceptible to atmosphere ever since I was a child.",
    "Sometimes you know I\u2019d feel I just\nhad to scream and scream.",
    "And that of course was very trying to my parents.",
    "But my\nmother was a lovely woman and she said to my father \u201cSinclair if the child feels like that\nwe must let her do it.",
    "Screaming is her way of expressing herself.\u201d And of course my\nfather agreed.",
    "He was devoted to my mother and just did everything she said.",
    "They were a\n45\n\n\fperfectly lovely couple as I\u2019m sure Mr Gardener will agree.",
    "They were a very remarkable\ncouple weren\u2019t they Odell\u2019\n\u2018Yes darling\u2019 said Mr Gardener.",
    "\u2018And where\u2019s your girl this morning Captain Marshall\u2019\n\u2018Linda I don\u2019t know.",
    "I expect she\u2019s mooning round the island somewhere.\u2019\n\u2018You know Captain Marshall that girl looks kind of peaky to me.",
    "She needs feeding up and\nvery very sympathetic treatment.\u2019\nKenneth Marshall said curtly \u2018Linda\u2019s all right.\u2019\nHe went up to the hotel.",
    "Patrick Redfern did not go into the water.",
    "He sat about frankly looking up towards the\nhotel.",
    "He was beginning to look a shade sulky.",
    "Miss Brewster was brisk and cheerful when she arrived.",
    "The conversation was much as it had been on a previous morning.",
    "Gentle yapping from\nMrs Gardener and short staccato barks from Miss Brewster.",
    "She remarked at last \u2018Beach seems a bit empty.",
    "Everyone off on excursions\u2019\nMrs Gardener said \u2018I was saying to Mr Gardener only this morning that we simply must\nmake an excursion to Dartmoor.",
    "It\u2019s quite near and the associations are all so romantic.",
    "And I\u2019d like to see that convict prison\u2014Princetown isn\u2019t it I think we\u2019d better fix up right\naway and go there tomorrow Odell.\u2019\nMr Gardener said \u2018Yes darling.\u2019\nHercule Poirot said to Miss Brewster.",
    "\u2018You are going to bathe Mademoiselle\u2019\n\u2018Oh I\u2019ve had my morning dip before breakfast.",
    "Somebody nearly brained me with a bottle\ntoo.",
    "Chucked it out of one of the hotel windows.\u2019\n\u2018Now that\u2019s a very dangerous thing to do\u2019 said Mrs Gardener.",
    "\u2018I had a very dear friend\nwho got concussion by a toothpaste tin falling on him in the street\u2014thrown out of a\nthirty\u2010fifth storey window it was.",
    "A most dangerous thing to do.",
    "He got very substantial\ndamages.\u2019 She began to hunt among her skeins of wool.",
    "\u2018Why Odell I don\u2019t believe I\u2019ve\ngot that second shade of purple wool.",
    "It\u2019s in the second drawer of the bureau in our\nbedroom or it might be the third.\u2019\n\u2018Yes darling.\u2019\n46\n\n\fMr Gardener rose obediently and departed on his search.",
    "Mrs Gardener went on \u2018Sometimes you know I do think that maybe we\u2019re going a little\ntoo far nowadays.",
    "What with all our great discoveries and all the electrical waves there\nmust be in the atmosphere I do think it leads to a great deal of mental unrest and I just\nfeel that maybe the time has come for a new message to humanity.",
    "I don\u2019t know M.\nPoirot if you\u2019ve ever interested yourself in the prophecies from the Pyramids.\u2019\n\u2018I have not\u2019 said Poirot.",
    "\u2018Well I do assure you that they\u2019re very very interesting.",
    "What with Moscow being exactly\na thousand miles due north of\u2014now what was it\u2014would it be Nineveh\u2014but anyway\nyou take a circle and it just shows the most surprising things\u2014and one can just see that\nthere must have been special guidance and that those ancient Egyptians couldn\u2019t have\nthought of what they did all by themselves.",
    "And when you\u2019ve gone into the theory of the\nnumbers and their repetition why it\u2019s all just so clear that I can\u2019t see how anyone can\ndoubt the truth of it for a moment.\u2019\nMrs Gardener paused triumphantly but neither Poirot nor Miss Emily Brewster felt moved\nto argue the point.",
    "Poirot studied his white su\u00e8de shoes ruefully.",
    "Emily Brewster said \u2018You been paddling with your shoes on M. Poirot\u2019\nPoirot murmured \u2018Alas I was precipitate.\u2019\nEmily Brewster lowered her voice.",
    "She said \u2018Where\u2019s our vamp this morning She\u2019s late.\u2019\nMrs Gardener raising her eyes from her knitting to study Patrick Redfern murmured \u2018He\nlooks just like a thundercloud.",
    "Oh dear I do feel the whole thing is such a pity.",
    "I wonder\nwhat Captain Marshall thinks about it all.",
    "He\u2019s such a nice quiet man\u2014very British and\nunassuming.",
    "You just never know what he\u2019s thinking about things.\u2019\nPatrick Redfern rose and began to pace up and down the beach.",
    "Mrs Gardener murmured \u2018Just like a tiger.\u2019\nThree pairs of eyes watched his pacing.",
    "Their scrutiny seemed to make Patrick Redfern\nuncomfortable.",
    "He looked more than sulky now.",
    "He looked in a flaming temper.",
    "In the stillness a faint chime from the mainland came to their ears.",
    "Emily Brewster murmured \u2018Wind\u2019s from the east again.",
    "That\u2019s a good sign when you can\nhear the church clock strike.\u2019\nNobody said any more until Mr Gardener returned with a skein of brilliant magenta wool.",
    "47\n\n\f\u2018Why Odell what a long time you have been\u2019\n\u2018Sorry darling but you see it wasn\u2019t in your bureau at all.",
    "I found it on your wardrobe\nshelf.\u2019\n\u2018Why isn\u2019t that too extraordinary I could have declared I put it in that bureau drawer.",
    "I\ndo think it\u2019s fortunate that I\u2019ve never had to give evidence in a court case.",
    "I\u2019d just worry\nmyself to death in case I wasn\u2019t remembering a thing just right.\u2019\nMr Gardener said \u2018Mrs Gardener is very conscientious.\u2019\nV\nIt was some five minutes later that Patrick Redfern said \u2018Going for your row this morning\nMiss Brewster Mind if I come with you\u2019\nMiss Brewster said heartily \u2018Delighted.\u2019\n\u2018Let\u2019s row right round the island\u2019 proposed Redfern.",
    "Miss Brewster consulted her watch.",
    "\u2018Shall we have time Oh yes it\u2019s not half\u2010past eleven yet.",
    "Come on then let\u2019s start.\u2019\nThey went down the beach together.",
    "Patrick Redfern took first turn at the oars.",
    "He rowed with a powerful stroke.",
    "The boat\nleapt forward.",
    "Emily Brewster said approvingly \u2018Good.",
    "We\u2019ll see if you can keep that up.\u2019\nHe laughed into her eyes.",
    "His spirits had improved.",
    "\u2018I shall probably have a fine crop of blisters by the time we get back.\u2019 He threw up his\nhead tossing back his black hair.",
    "\u2018God it\u2019s a marvellous day If you do get a real summer\u2019s\nday in England there\u2019s nothing to beat it.\u2019\nEmily Brewster said gruffly \u2018Can\u2019t beat England anyway in my opinion.",
    "Only place in the\nworld to live in.\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019m with you.\u2019\nThey rounded the point of the bay to the west and rowed under the cliffs.",
    "Patrick Redfern\nlooked up.",
    "\u2018Any one on Sunny Ledge this morning Yes there\u2019s a sunshade.",
    "Who is it I wonder\u2019\nEmily Brewster said \u2018It\u2019s Miss Darnley I think.",
    "She\u2019s got one of those Japanese affairs.\u2019\n48\n\n\fThey rowed up the coast.",
    "On their left was the open sea.",
    "Emily Brewster said \u2018We ought to have gone the other way round.",
    "This way we\u2019ve got the\ncurrent against us.\u2019\n\u2018There\u2019s very little current.",
    "I\u2019ve swum out here and not noticed it.",
    "Anyway we couldn\u2019t go\nthe other way the causeway wouldn\u2019t be covered.\u2019\n\u2018Depends on the tide of course.",
    "But they always say that bathing from Pixy Cove is\ndangerous if you swim out too far.\u2019\nPatrick was rowing vigorously still.",
    "At the same time he was scanning the cliffs attentively.",
    "Emily Brewster thought suddenly \u2018He\u2019s looking for the Marshall woman.",
    "That\u2019s why he\nwanted to come with me.",
    "She hasn\u2019t shown up this morning and he\u2019s wondering what\nshe\u2019s up to.",
    "Probably she\u2019s done it on purpose.",
    "Just a move in the game\u2014to make him\nkeener.\u2019\nThey rounded the jutting point of rock to the south of the little bay named Pixy\u2019s Cove.",
    "It\nwas quite a small cove with rocks dotted fantastically about the beach.",
    "It faced nearly\nnorth\u2010west and the cliff overhung it a good deal.",
    "It was a favourite place for picnic teas.",
    "In\nthe morning when the sun was off it was not popular and there was seldom anyone\nthere.",
    "On this occasion however there was a figure on the beach.",
    "Patrick Redfern\u2019s stroke checked and recovered.",
    "He said in a would\u2010be casual tone \u2018Hullo who\u2019s that\u2019\nMiss Brewster said dryly \u2018It looks like Mrs Marshall.\u2019\nPatrick Redfern said as though struck by the idea.",
    "\u2018So it does.\u2019\nHe altered his course rowing inshore.",
    "Emily Brewster protested.",
    "\u2018We don\u2019t want to land here do we\u2019\nPatrick Redfern said quickly \u2018Oh plenty of time.\u2019\nHis eyes looked into hers\u2014something in them a naive pleading look rather like that of an\nimportunate dog silenced Emily Brewster.",
    "She thought to herself \u2018Poor boy he\u2019s got it\nbadly.",
    "Oh well it can\u2019t be helped.",
    "He\u2019ll get over it in time.\u2019\n49\n\n\fThe boat was fast approaching the beach.",
    "Arlena Marshall was lying face downwards on the shingle her arms outstretched.",
    "The\nwhite float was drawn up nearby.",
    "Something was puzzling Emily Brewster.",
    "It was as though she was looking at something\nshe knew quite well but which was in one respect quite wrong.",
    "It was a minute or two before it came to her.",
    "Arlena Marshall\u2019s attitude was the attitude of a sun\u2010bather.",
    "So had she lain many a time\non the beach by the hotel her bronzed body outstretched and the green cardboard hat\nprotecting her head and neck.",
    "But there was no sun on Pixy\u2019s Beach and there would be none for some hours yet.",
    "The\noverhanging cliff protected the beach from the sun in the morning.",
    "A vague feeling of\napprehension came over Emily Brewster.",
    "The boat grounded on the shingle.",
    "Patrick Redfern called \u2018Hullo Arlena.\u2019\nAnd then Emily Brewster\u2019s foreboding took definite shape.",
    "For the recumbent figure did\nnot move or answer.",
    "Emily saw Patrick Redfern\u2019s face change.",
    "He jumped out of the boat and she followed him.",
    "They dragged the boat ashore then set off up the beach to where that white figure lay so\nstill and unresponsive near the bottom of the cliff.",
    "Patrick Redfern got there first but Emily Brewster was close behind him.",
    "She saw as one sees in a dream the bronzed limbs the white backless bathing\u2010dress\u2014the\nred curl of hair escaping under the jade\u2010green hat\u2014saw something else too\u2014the curious\nunnatural angle of the outspread arms.",
    "Felt in that minute that this body had not lain\ndown but had been thrown...\nShe heard Patrick\u2019s voice\u2014a mere frightened whisper.",
    "He knelt down beside that still\nform\u2014touched the hand\u2014the arm...",
    "He said in a low shuddering whisper \u2018My God she\u2019s dead...\u2019\nAnd then as he lifted the hat a little peered at the neck \u2018Oh God she\u2019s been strangled...\nmurdered.\u2019\nVI\nIt was one of those moments when time stands still.",
    "With an odd feeling of unreality Emily Brewster heard herself saying \u2018We musn\u2019t touch\nanything... Not until the police come.\u2019\n50\n\n\fRedfern\u2019s answer came mechanically.",
    "\u2018No\u2014no\u2014of course not.\u2019 And then in a deep agonized whisper.",
    "\u2018Who Who Who could\nhave done that to Arlena.",
    "She can\u2019t have\u2014have been murdered.",
    "It can\u2019t be true\u2019\nEmily Brewster shook her head not knowing quite what to answer.",
    "She heard him draw in his breath\u2014heard the low controlled rage in his voice as he said\n\u2018My God if I get my hands on the foul fiend who did this.\u2019\nEmily Brewster shivered.",
    "Her imagination pictured a lurking murderer behind one of the\nboulders.",
    "Then she heard her voice saying \u2018Whoever did it wouldn\u2019t be hanging about.",
    "We\nmust get the police.",
    "Perhaps\u2014\u2019 she hesitated\u2014\u2018one of us ought to stay with\u2014with the\nbody.\u2019\nPatrick Redfern said \u2018I\u2019ll stay.\u2019\nEmily Brewster drew a little sigh of relief.",
    "She was not the kind of woman who would ever\nadmit to feeling fear but she was secretly thankful not to have to remain on that beach\nalone with the faint possibility of a homicidal maniac lingering close at hand.",
    "She said \u2018Good.",
    "I\u2019ll be as quick as I can.",
    "I\u2019ll go in the boat.",
    "Can\u2019t face that ladder.",
    "There\u2019s a\nconstable at Leathercombe Bay.\u2019\nPatrick Redfern murmured mechanically \u2018Yes\u2014yes whatever you think best.\u2019\nAs she rowed vigorously away from the shore Emily Brewster saw Patrick drop down\nbeside the dead woman and bury his head in his hands.",
    "There was something so forlorn\nabout his attitude that she felt an unwilling sympathy.",
    "He looked like a dog watching by its\ndead master.",
    "Nevertheless her robust common sense was saying to her \u2018Best thing that\ncould have happened for him and his wife\u2014and for Marshall and the child\u2014but I don\u2019t\nsuppose he can see it that way poor devil.\u2019\nEmily Brewster was a woman who could always rise to an emergency.",
    "51\n\n\f52\n\n\fChapter 5\nInspector Colgate stood back by the cliff waiting for the police\u2010surgeon to finish with\nArlena\u2019s body.",
    "Patrick Redfern and Emily Brewster stood a little to one side.",
    "Dr Neasden rose from his knees with a quick deft movement.",
    "He said \u2018Strangled\u2014and by a pretty powerful pair of hands.",
    "She doesn\u2019t seem to have put\nup much of a struggle.",
    "Taken by surprise.",
    "H\u2019m\u2014well\u2014nasty business.\u2019\nEmily Brewster had taken one look and then quickly averted her eyes from the dead\nwoman\u2019s face.",
    "That horrible purple convulsed countenance.",
    "Inspector Colgate asked \u2018What about time of death\u2019\nNeasden said irritably \u2018Can\u2019t say definitely without knowing more about her.",
    "Lots of\nfactors to take into account.",
    "Let\u2019s see it\u2019s quarter to one now.",
    "What time was it when you\nfound her\u2019\nPatrick Redfern to whom the question was addressed said vaguely \u2018Some time before\ntwelve.",
    "I don\u2019t know exactly.\u2019\nEmily Brewster said \u2018It was exactly a quarter to twelve when we found she was dead.\u2019\n\u2018Ah and you came here in the boat.",
    "What time was it when you caught sight of her lying\nhere\u2019\nEmily Brewster considered.",
    "\u2018I should say we rounded the point about five or six minutes earlier.\u2019 She turned to\nRedfern.",
    "\u2018Do you agree\u2019\nHe said vaguely \u2018Yes\u2014yes\u2014about that I should think.\u2019\nNeasden asked the Inspector in a low voice \u2018This the husband Oh I see my mistake.",
    "Thought it might be.",
    "He seems rather done in over it.\u2019\nHe raised his voice officially.",
    "\u2018Let\u2019s put it at twenty minutes to twelve.",
    "She cannot have been killed very long before\nthat.",
    "Say between then and eleven\u2014quarter to eleven at the earliest outside limit.\u2019\nThe Inspector shut his notebook with a snap.",
    "\u2018Thanks\u2019 he said.",
    "\u2018That ought to help us considerably.",
    "Puts it within very narrow limits\u2014\nless than an hour all told.\u2019\nHe turned to Miss Brewster.",
    "53\n\n\f\u2018Now then I think it\u2019s all clear so far.",
    "You\u2019re Miss Emily Brewster and this is Mr Patrick\nRedfern both staying at the Jolly Roger Hotel.",
    "You identify this lady as a fellow guest of\nyours at the hotel\u2014the wife of a Captain Marshall\u2019\nEmily Brewster nodded.",
    "\u2018Then I think\u2019 said Inspector Colgate \u2018that we\u2019ll adjourn to the hotel.\u2019\nHe beckoned to a constable.",
    "\u2018Hawkes you stay here and don\u2019t allow anyone on to this cove.",
    "I\u2019ll be sending Phillips\nalong later.\u2019\nII\n\u2018Upon my soul\u2019 said Colonel Weston.",
    "\u2018This is a surprise finding you here\u2019\nHercule Poirot replied to the Chief Constable\u2019s greeting in a suitable manner.",
    "He\nmurmured \u2018Ah yes many years have passed since that affair at St Loo.\u2019\n\u2018I haven\u2019t forgotten it though\u2019 said Weston.",
    "\u2018Biggest surprise of my life.",
    "The thing I\u2019ve\nnever got over though is the way you got round me about that funeral business.",
    "Absolutely unorthodox the whole thing.",
    "Fantastic\u2019\n\u2018Tout de m\u00eame mon Colonel\u2019 said Poirot.",
    "\u2018It produced the goods did it not\u2019\n\u2018Er\u2014well possibly.",
    "I dare say we should have got there by more orthodox methods.\u2019\n\u2018It is possible\u2019 agreed Poirot diplomatically.",
    "\u2018And here you are in the thick of another murder\u2019 said the Chief Constable.",
    "\u2018Any ideas\nabout this one\u2019\nPoirot said slowly \u2018Nothing definite\u2014but it is interesting.\u2019\n\u2018Going to give us a hand\u2019\n\u2018You would permit it yes\u2019\n\u2018My dear fellow delighted to have you.",
    "Don\u2019t know enough yet to decide whether it\u2019s a\ncase for Scotland Yard or not.",
    "Off\u2010hand it looks as though our murderer must be pretty\nwell within a limited radius.",
    "On the other hand all these people are strangers down here.",
    "To find out about them and their motives you\u2019ve got to go to London.\u2019\nPoirot said \u2018Yes that is true.\u2019\n\n54\n\n\f\u2018First of all\u2019 said Weston \u2018we\u2019ve got to find out who last saw the dead woman alive.",

    "I assisted her to launch her float from the bathing beach.\u2019\n\u2018And she went off on it\u2019\n\u2018Yes.\u2019\n\u2018Alone\u2019\n\u2018Yes.\u2019\n\u2018Did you see which direction she took\u2019\n\u2018She paddled round that point there to the right.\u2019\n\u2018In the direction of Pixy\u2019s Cove that is\u2019\n\u2018Yes.\u2019\n\u2018And the time then was\u2014\u2019\n\u2018I should say she actually left the beach at a quarter past ten.\u2019\nWeston considered.",
    "\u2018That fits in well enough.",
    "How long should you say that it would take her to paddle round\nto the Cove\u2019\n\u2018Ah me I am not an expert.",
    "I do not go in boats or expose myself on floats.",
    "Perhaps half an\nhour\u2019\n\u2018That\u2019s about what I think\u2019 said the Colonel.",
    "\u2018She wouldn\u2019t be hurrying I presume.",
    "Well if\nshe arrived there at a quarter to eleven that fits in well enough.\u2019\n\u2018At what time does your doctor suggest she died\u2019\n\u2018Oh Neasden doesn\u2019t commit himself.",
    "He\u2019s a cautious chap.",
    "A quarter to eleven is his\nearliest outside limit.\u2019\nPoirot nodded.",
    "He said \u2018There is one other point that I must mention.",
    "As she left Mrs\nMarshall asked me not to say I had seen her.\u2019\n55\n\n\fWeston stared.",
    "He said \u2018H\u2019m that\u2019s rather suggestive isn\u2019t it\u2019\nPoirot murmured.",
    "\u2018Yes.",
    "I thought so myself.\u2019\nWeston tugged at his moustache.",
    "He said \u2018Look here Poirot.",
    "You\u2019re a man of the world.",
    "What sort of a woman was Mrs Marshall\u2019\nA faint smile came to Poirot\u2019s lips.",
    "He asked \u2018Have you not already heard\u2019\nThe Chief Constable said dryly \u2018I know what the women say of her.",
    "They would.",
    "How\nmuch truth is there in it Was she having an affair with this fellow Redfern\u2019\n\u2018I should say undoubtedly yes.\u2019\n\u2018He followed her down here eh\u2019\n\u2018There is reason to suppose so.\u2019\n\u2018And the husband Did he know about it What did he feel\u2019\nPoirot said slowly \u2018It is not easy to know what Captain Marshall feels or thinks.",
    "He is a\nman who does not display his emotions.\u2019\nWeston said sharply \u2018But he might have \u2019em all the same.\u2019\nPoirot nodded.",
    "He said \u2018Oh yes he might have them.\u2019\nIII\nThe Chief Constable was being as tactful as it was in his nature to be with Mrs Castle.",
    "Mrs Castle was the owner and proprietress of the Jolly Roger Hotel.",
    "She was a woman of\nforty odd with a large bust rather violent henna red hair and an almost offensively\nrefined manner of speech.",
    "She was saying \u2018That such a thing should happen in my hotel Ay am sure it has always\nbeen the quayettest place imaginable The people who come here are such naice people.",
    "No rowdiness\u2014if you know what ay mean.",
    "Not like the big hotels in St Loo.\u2019\n\u2018Quite so Mrs Castle\u2019 said Colonel Weston.",
    "\u2018But accidents happen in the best regulated\u2014\ner households.\u2019\n56\n\n\f\u2018Ay\u2019m sure Inspector Colgate will bear me out\u2019 said Mrs Castle sending an appealing\nglance towards the Inspector who was sitting looking very official.",
    "\u2018As to the laycensing\nlaws ay am most particular.",
    "There has never been any irregularity\u2019\n\u2018Quite quite\u2019 said Weston.",
    "\u2018We\u2019re not blaming you in any way Mrs Castle.\u2019\n\u2018But it does so reflect upon an establishment\u2019 said Mrs Castle her large bust heaving.",
    "\u2018When ay think of the noisy gaping crowds.",
    "Of course no one but hotel guests are allowed\nupon the island\u2014but all the same they will no doubt come and point from the shore.\u2019\nShe shuddered.",
    "Inspector Colgate saw his chance to turn the conversation to good account.",
    "He said \u2018In regard to that point you\u2019ve just raised.",
    "Access to the island.",
    "How do you keep\npeople off\u2019\n\u2018Ay am most particular about it.\u2019\n\u2018Yes but what measures do you take What keeps \u2019em off Holiday crowds in summer\ntime swarm everywhere like flies.\u2019\nMrs Castle shrugged slightly again.",
    "She said \u2018That is the fault of the charabancs.",
    "Ay have seen eighteen at one time parked by\nthe quay at Leathercombe Bay.",
    "Eighteen\u2019\n\u2018Just so.",
    "How do you stop them coming here\u2019\n\u2018There are notices.",
    "And then of course at high tide we are cut off.\u2019\n\u2018Yes but at low tide\u2019\nMrs Castle explained.",
    "At the island end of the causeway there was a gate.",
    "This said \u2018Jolly\nRoger Hotel.",
    "Private.",
    "No entry except to Hotel.\u2019 The rocks rose sheer out of the sea on\neither side there and could not be climbed.",
    "\u2018Anyone could take a boat though I suppose and row round and land on one of the\ncoves You couldn\u2019t stop them doing that.",
    "There\u2019s a right of access to the foreshore.",
    "You\ncan\u2019t stop people being on the beach between low and high watermark.\u2019\nBut this it seemed very seldom happened.",
    "Boats could be obtained at Leathercombe Bay\nharbour but from there it was a long row to the island and there was also a strong\ncurrent just outside Leathercombe Bay harbour.",
    "There were notices too on both Gull Cove and Pixy Cove by the ladder.",
    "She added that\nGeorge or William were always on the look out at the bathing beach proper which was the\nnearest to the mainland.",
    "57\n\n\f\u2018Who are George and William\u2019\n\u2018George attends to the bathing beach.",
    "He sees to the costumes and the floats.",
    "William is\nthe gardener.",
    "He keeps the paths and marks the tennis courts and all that.\u2019\nColonel Weston said impatiently \u2018Well that seems clear enough.",
    "That\u2019s not to say that\nnobody could have come from outside but anyone who did so took a risk\u2014the risk of\nbeing noticed.",
    "We\u2019ll have a word with George and William presently.\u2019\nMrs Castle said \u2018Ay do not care for trippers\u2014a very noisy crowd and they frequently\nleave orange peel and cigarette boxes on the causeway and down by the rocks but all the\nsame ay never thought one of them would turn out to be a murderer.",
    "Oh dear it really is\ntoo terrible for words.",
    "A lady like Mrs Marshall murdered and what\u2019s so horrible\nactually\u2014er\u2014strangled...\u2019\nMrs Castle could hardly bring herself to say the word.",
    "She brought it out with the utmost\nreluctance.",
    "Inspector Colgate said soothingly \u2018Yes it\u2019s a nasty business.\u2019\n\u2018And the newspapers.",
    "My hotel in the newspapers\u2019\nColgate said with a faint grin.",
    "\u2018Oh well it\u2019s advertisement in a way.\u2019\nMrs Castle drew herself up.",
    "Her bust heaved and whalebone creaked.",
    "She said icily \u2018That\nis not the kind of advertisement ay care about Mr Colgate.\u2019\nColonel Weston broke in.",
    "He said \u2018Now then Mrs Castle you\u2019ve got a list of the guests\nstaying here as I asked you\u2019\n\u2018Yes sir.\u2019\nColonel Weston pored over the hotel register.",
    "He looked over to Poirot who made the\nfourth member of the group assembled in the manageress\u2019s office.",
    "\u2018This is where you\u2019ll probably be able to help us presently.\u2019\nHe read down the names.",
    "\u2018What about servants\u2019\nMrs Castle produced a second list.",
    "\u2018There are four chambermaids the head waiter and three under him and Henry in the bar.",
    "William does the boots and shoes.",
    "Then there\u2019s the cook and two under her.\u2019\n58\n\n\f\u2018What about the waiters\u2019\n\u2018Well sir Albert the Mater Dotel came to me from the Vincent at Plymouth.",
    "He was\nthere for some years.",
    "The three under him have been here for three years\u2014one of them\nfour.",
    "They are very naise lads and most respectable.",
    "Henry has been here since the hotel\nopened.",
    "He is quite an institution.\u2019\nWeston nodded.",
    "He said to Colgate \u2018Seems all right.",
    "You\u2019ll check up on them of course.",
    "Thank you Mrs Castle.\u2019\n\u2018That will be all you require\u2019\n\u2018For the moment yes.\u2019\nMrs Castle creaked out of the room.",
    "Weston said \u2018First thing to do is to talk with Captain Marshall.",
    "IV\nKenneth Marshall sat quietly answering the questions put to him.",
    "Apart from a slight\nhardening of his features he was quite calm.",
    "Seen here with the sunlight falling on him\nfrom the window you realized that he was a handsome man.",
    "Those straight features the\nsteady blue eyes the firm mouth.",
    "His voice was low and pleasant.",
    "Colonel Weston was saying \u2018I quite understand Captain Marshall what a terrible shock\nthis must be to you.",
    "But you realize that I am anxious to get the fullest information as soon\nas possible.\u2019\nMarshall nodded.",
    "He said \u2018I quite understand.",
    "Carry on.\u2019\n\u2018Mrs Marshall was your second wife\u2019\n\u2018Yes.\u2019\n\u2018And you have been married how long\u2019\n\u2018Just over four years.\u2019\n\u2018And her name before she was married\u2019\n\u2018Helen Stuart.",
    "Her acting name was Arlena Stuart.\u2019\n\u2018She was an actress\u2019\n\u2018She appeared in Revue and musical shows.\u2019\n59\n\n\f\u2018Did she give up the stage on her marriage\u2019\n\u2018No.",
    "She continued to appear.",
    "She actually retired only about a year and a half ago.\u2019\n\u2018Was there any special reason for her retirement\u2019\nKenneth Marshall appeared to consider.",
    "\u2018No\u2019 he said.",
    "\u2018She simply said that she was tired of it all.\u2019\n\u2018It was not\u2014er\u2014in obedience to your special wish\u2019\nMarshall raised his eyebrows.",
    "\u2018Oh no.\u2019\n\u2018You were quite content for her to continue acting after your marriage\u2019\nMarshall smiled very faintly.",
    "\u2018I should have preferred her to give it up\u2014that yes.",
    "But I made no fuss about it.\u2019\n\u2018It caused no point of dissension between you\u2019\n\u2018Certainly not.",
    "My wife was free to please herself.\u2019\n\u2018And\u2014the marriage was a happy one\u2019\nKenneth Marshall said coldly \u2018Certainly.\u2019\nColonel Weston paused a minute.",
    "Then he said \u2018Captain Marshall have you any idea who\ncould possibly have killed your wife\u2019\nThe answer came without the least hesitation.",
    "\u2018None whatever.\u2019\n\u2018Had she any enemies\u2019\n\u2018Possibly.\u2019\n\u2018Ah\u2019\nThe other went on quickly.",
    "He said \u2018Don\u2019t misunderstand me sir.",
    "My wife was an actress.",
    "She was also a very good\u2010looking woman.",
    "In both capacities she aroused a certain amount\nof jealousy and envy.",
    "There were fusses over parts\u2014there was rivalry from other\nwomen\u2014there was a good deal shall we say of general envy hatred malice and all\n60\n\n\funcharitableness But that is not to say that there was anyone who was capable of\ndeliberately murdering her.\u2019\nHercule Poirot spoke for the first time.",
    "He said \u2018What you really mean Monsieur is that\nher enemies were mostly or entirely women\u2019\nKenneth Marshall looked across at him.",
    "\u2018Yes\u2019 he said.",
    "\u2018That is so.\u2019\nThe Chief Constable said \u2018You know of no man who had a grudge against her\u2019\n\u2018No.\u2019\n\u2018Was she previously acquainted with anyone in this hotel\u2019\n\u2018I believe she had met Mr Redfern before\u2014at some cocktail party.",
    "Nobody else to my\nknowledge.\u2019\nWeston paused.",
    "He seemed to deliberate as to whether to pursue the subject.",
    "Then he\ndecided against that course.",
    "He said \u2018We now come to this morning.",
    "When was the last\ntime you saw your wife\u2019\nMarshall paused a minute then he said \u2018I looked in on my way down to breakfast\u2014\u2019\n\u2018Excuse me you occupied separate rooms\u2019\n\u2018Yes.\u2019\n\u2018And what time was that\u2019\n\u2018It must have been about nine o\u2019clock.\u2019\n\u2018What was she doing\u2019\n\u2018She was opening her letters.\u2019\n\u2018Did she say anything\u2019\n\u2018Nothing of any particular interest.",
    "Just good morning\u2014and that it was a nice day\u2014that\nsort of thing.\u2019\n\u2018What was her manner Unusual at all\u2019\n\u2018No perfectly normal.\u2019\n\u2018She did not seem excited or depressed or upset in any way\u2019\n61\n\n\f\u2018I certainly didn\u2019t notice it.\u2019\nHercule Poirot said \u2018Did she mention at all what were the contents of her letters\u2019\nAgain a faint smile appeared on Marshall\u2019s lips.",
    "He said \u2018As far as I can remember she said\nthey were all bills.\u2019\n\u2018Your wife breakfasted in bed\u2019\n\u2018Yes.\u2019\n\u2018Did she always do that\u2019\n\u2018Invariably.\u2019\nHercule Poirot said \u2018What time did she usually come downstairs\u2019\n\u2018Oh between ten and eleven\u2014usually nearer eleven.\u2019\nPoirot went on \u2018If she was to descend at ten o\u2019clock exactly that would be rather\nsurprising\u2019\n\u2018Yes.",
    "She wasn\u2019t often down as early as that.\u2019\n\u2018But she was this morning.",
    "Why do you think that was Captain Marshall\u2019\nMarshall said unemotionally \u2018Haven\u2019t the least idea.",
    "Might have been the weather\u2014extra\nfine day and all that.\u2019\n\u2018You missed her\u2019\nKenneth Marshall shifted a little in his chair.",
    "He said \u2018Looked in on her again after\nbreakfast.",
    "Room was empty.",
    "I was a bit surprised.\u2019\n\u2018And then you came down on the beach and asked me if I had seen her\u2019\n\u2018Er\u2014yes.\u2019 He added with a faint emphasis in his voice.",
    "\u2018And you said you hadn\u2019t...\u2019\nThe innocent eyes of Hercule Poirot did not falter.",
    "Gently he caressed his large and\nflamboyant moustache.",
    "Weston asked \u2018Had you any special reason for wanting to find your wife this morning\u2019\nMarshall shifted his glance amiably to the Chief Constable.",
    "He said \u2018No just wondered where she was that\u2019s all.\u2019\n\n62\n\n\fWeston paused.",
    "He moved his chair slightly.",
    "His voice fell into a different key.",
    "He said\n\u2018Just now Captain Marshall you mentioned that your wife had a previous acquaintance\nwith Mr Patrick Redfern.",
    "How well did your wife know Mr Redfern\u2019\nKenneth Marshall said \u2018Mind if I smoke\u2019 He felt through his pockets.",
    "\u2018Dash I\u2019ve mislaid\nmy pipe somewhere.\u2019\nPoirot offered him a cigarette which he accepted.",
    "Lighting it he said \u2018You were asking\nabout Redfern.",
    "My wife told me she had come across him at some cocktail party or other.\u2019\n\u2018He was then just a casual acquaintance\u2019\n\u2018I believe so.\u2019\n\u2018Since then\u2014\u2019 the Chief Constable paused.",
    "\u2018I understand that that acquaintanceship has\nripened into something rather closer.\u2019\nMarshall said sharply \u2018You understand that do you Who told you so\u2019\n\u2018It is the common gossip of the hotel.\u2019\nFor a moment Marshall\u2019s eyes went to Hercule Poirot.",
    "They dwelt on him with a kind of\ncold anger.",
    "He said \u2018Hotel gossip is usually a tissue of lies\u2019\n\u2018Possibly.",
    "But I gather that Mr Redfern and your wife gave some grounds for the gossip.\u2019\n\u2018What grounds\u2019\n\u2018They were constantly in each other\u2019s company.\u2019\n\u2018Is that all\u2019\n\u2018You do not deny that that was so\u2019\n\u2018May have been.",
    "I really didn\u2019t notice.\u2019\n\u2018You did not\u2014excuse me Captain Marshall\u2014object to your wife\u2019s friendship with Mr\nRedfern\u2019\n\u2018I wasn\u2019t in the habit of criticizing my wife\u2019s conduct.\u2019\n\u2018You did not protest or object in any way\u2019\n\u2018Certainly not.\u2019\n\u2018Not even though it was becoming a subject of scandal and an estrangement was growing\nup between Mr Redfern and his wife\u2019\n63\n\n\fKenneth Marshall said coldly \u2018I mind my own business and I expect other people to mind\ntheirs.",
    "I don\u2019t listen to gossip and tittle tattle.\u2019\n\u2018You won\u2019t deny that Mr Redfern admired your wife\u2019\n\u2018He probably did.",
    "Most men did.",
    "She was a very beautiful woman.\u2019\n\u2018But you yourself were persuaded that there was nothing serious in the affair\u2019\n\u2018I never thought about it I tell you.\u2019\n\u2018And suppose we have a witness who can testify that they were on terms of the greatest\nintimacy\u2019\nAgain those blue eyes went to Hercule Poirot.",
    "Again an expression of dislike showed on\nthat usually impassive face.",
    "Marshall said \u2018If you want to listen to these tales listen to \u2019em.",
    "My wife\u2019s dead and can\u2019t\ndefend herself.\u2019\n\u2018You mean that you personally don\u2019t believe them\u2019\nFor the first time a faint dew of sweat was observable on Marshall\u2019s brow.",
    "He said \u2018I don\u2019t\npropose to believe anything of the kind.\u2019\nHe went on \u2018Aren\u2019t you getting a good way from the essentials of this business What I\nbelieve or don\u2019t believe is surely not relevant to the plain fact of murder\u2019\nHercule Poirot answered before either of the others could speak.",
    "He said \u2018You do not\ncomprehend Captain Marshall.",
    "There is no such thing as a plain fact of murder.",
    "Murder\nsprings nine times out of ten out of the character and circumstances of the murdered\nperson.",
    "Because the victim was the kind of person he or she was therefore was he or she\nmurdered Until we can understand fully and completely exactly what kind of a person\nArlena Marshall was we shall not be able to see clearly exactly the kind of person who\nmurdered her.",
    "From that springs the necessity of our questions.\u2019\nMarshall turned to the Chief Constable.",
    "He said \u2018That your view too\u2019\nWeston boggled a little.",
    "He said \u2018Well up to a point\u2014that is to say\u2014\u2019\nMarshall gave a short laugh.",
    "He said \u2018Thought you wouldn\u2019t agree.",
    "This character stuff is\nM. Poirot\u2019s speciality I believe.\u2019\nPoirot said smiling \u2018You can at least congratulate yourself on having done nothing to\nassist me\u2019\n\u2018What do you mean\u2019\n64\n\n\f\u2018What have you told us about your wife Exactly nothing at all.",
    "You have told us only what\neveryone could see for themselves.",
    "That she was beautiful and admired.",
    "Nothing more.\u2019\nKenneth Marshall shrugged his shoulders.",
    "He said simply \u2018You\u2019re crazy.\u2019\nHe looked towards the Chief Constable and said with emphasis \u2018Anything else sir that\nyou\u2019d like me to tell you\u2019\n\u2018Yes Captain Marshall your own movements this morning please.\u2019\nKenneth Marshall nodded.",
    "He had clearly expected this.",
    "He said \u2018I breakfasted downstairs about nine o\u2019clock as usual and read the paper.",
    "As I told\nyou I went up to my wife\u2019s room afterwards and found she had gone out.",
    "I came down to\nthe beach saw M. Poirot and asked if he had seen her.",
    "Then I had a quick bathe and went\nup to the hotel again.",
    "It was then let me see about twenty to eleven\u2014yes just about\nthat.",
    "I saw the clock in the lounge.",
    "It was just after twenty minutes to.",
    "I went up to my\nroom but the chambermaid hadn\u2019t quite finished it.",
    "I asked her to finish as quickly as she\ncould.",
    "I had some letters to type which I wanted to get off by the post.",
    "I went downstairs\nagain and had a word or two with Henry in the bar.",
    "I went up again to my room at ten\nminutes to eleven.",
    "There I typed my letters.",
    "I typed until ten minutes to twelve.",
    "I then\nchanged into tennis kit as I had a date to play tennis at twelve.",
    "We\u2019d booked the court the\nday before.\u2019\n\u2018Who was we\u2019\n\u2018Mrs Redfern Miss Darnley Mr Gardener and myself.",
    "I came down at twelve o\u2019clock and\nwent up to the court.",
    "Miss Darnley was there and Mr Gardener.",
    "Mrs Redfern arrived a few\nminutes later.",
    "We played tennis for an hour.",
    "Just as we came into the hotel afterwards I\u2014\nI\u2014got the news.\u2019\n\u2018Thank you Captain Marshall.",
    "Just as a matter of form is there anyone who can\ncorroborate the fact that you were typing in your room between\u2014er\u2014ten minutes to\neleven and ten minutes to twelve\u2019\nKenneth Marshall said with a faint smile \u2018Have you got some idea that I killed my own\nwife Let me see now.",
    "The chambermaid was about doing the rooms.",
    "She must have\nheard the typewriter going.",
    "And then there are the letters themselves.",
    "With all this upset I\nhaven\u2019t posted them.",
    "I should imagine they are as good evidence as anything.\u2019\nHe took three letters from his pocket.",
    "They were addressed but not stamped.",
    "He said\n\u2018Their contents by the way are strictly confidential.",
    "But when it\u2019s a case of murder one is\nforced to trust in the discretion of the police.",
    "They contain lists of figures and various\nfinancial statements.",
    "I think you will find that if you put one of your men on to type them\nout he won\u2019t do it in much under an hour.\u2019\nHe paused.",
    "65\n\n\f\u2018Satisfied I hope\u2019\nWeston said smoothly.",
    "\u2018It is no question of suspicion.",
    "Everyone on the island will be asked to account for his or\nher movements between a quarter to eleven and twenty minutes to twelve this morning.\u2019\nKenneth Marshall said \u2018Quite.\u2019\nWeston said \u2018One more thing Captain Marshall.",
    "Do you know anything about the way\nyour wife was likely to have disposed of any property she had\u2019\n\u2018You mean a will I don\u2019t think she ever made a will.\u2019\n\u2018But you are not sure\u2019\n\u2018Her solicitors are Barkett Markett  Applegood Bedford Square.",
    "They saw to all her\ncontracts etc.",
    "But I\u2019m fairly certain she never made a will.",
    "She said once that doing a thing\nlike that would give her the shivers.\u2019\n\u2018In that case if she has died intestate you as her husband succeed to her property.\u2019\n\u2018Yes I suppose I do.\u2019\n\u2018Had she any near relatives\u2019\n\u2018I don\u2019t think so.",
    "If she had she never mentioned them.",
    "I know that her father and mother\ndied when she was a child and she had no brothers or sisters.\u2019\n\u2018In any case I suppose she had nothing very much to leave\u2019\nKenneth Marshall said coldly \u2018On the contrary.",
    "Only two years ago Sir Robert Erskine\nwho was an old friend of hers died and left her most of his fortune.",
    "It amounted I think\nto about fifty thousand pounds.\u2019\nInspector Colgate looked up.",
    "An alertness came into his glance.",
    "Up to now he had been\nsilent.",
    "Now he asked \u2018Then actually Captain Marshall your wife was a rich woman\u2019\nKenneth Marshall shrugged his shoulders.",
    "\u2018I suppose she was really.\u2019\n\u2018And you still say she did not make a will\u2019\n\u2018You can ask the solicitors.",
    "But I\u2019m pretty certain she didn\u2019t.",
    "As I tell you she thought it\nunlucky.\u2019\nThere was a pause then Marshall added \u2018Is there anything further\u2019\n66\n\n\fWeston shook his head.",
    "\u2018Don\u2019t think so\u2014eh Colgate No.",
    "Once more Captain Marshall let me offer you all my\nsympathy in your loss.\u2019\nMarshall blinked.",
    "He said jerkily \u2018Oh\u2014thanks.\u2019\nHe went out.",
    "V\nThe three men looked at each other.",
    "Weston said \u2018Cool customer.",
    "Not giving anything away is he What do you make of him\nColgate\u2019\nThe Inspector shook his head.",
    "\u2018It\u2019s difficult to tell.",
    "He\u2019s not the kind that shows anything.",
    "That sort makes a bad\nimpression in the witness\u2010box and yet it\u2019s a bit unfair on them really.",
    "Sometimes they\u2019re\nas cut up as anything and yet can\u2019t show it.",
    "That kind of manner made the jury bring in a\nverdict of Guilty against Wallace.",
    "It wasn\u2019t the evidence.",
    "They just couldn\u2019t believe that a\nman could lose his wife and talk and act so coolly about it.\u2019\nWeston turned to Poirot.",
    "\u2018What do you think Poirot\u2019\nHercule Poirot raised his hands.",
    "He said \u2018What can one say He is the closed box\u2014the fastened oyster.",
    "He has chosen his\nr\u00f4le.",
    "He has heard nothing he has seen nothing he knows nothing\u2019\n\u2018We\u2019ve got a choice of motives\u2019 said Colgate.",
    "\u2018There\u2019s jealousy and there\u2019s the money\nmotive.",
    "Of course in a way a husband\u2019s the obvious suspect.",
    "One naturally thinks of him\nfirst.",
    "If he knew his missus was carrying on with the other chap\u2014\u2019\nPoirot interrupted.",
    "He said \u2018I think he knew that.\u2019\n\u2018Why do you say so\u2019\n\u2018Listen my friend.",
    "Last night I had been talking with Mrs Redfern on Sunny Ledge.",
    "I came\ndown from there to the hotel and on my way I saw those two together\u2014Mrs Marshall and\nPatrick Redfern.",
    "And a moment or two after I met Captain Marshall.",
    "His face was very stiff.",
    "It says nothing\u2014but nothing at all It is almost too blank if you understand me.",
    "Oh he\nknew all right.\u2019\n67\n\n\fColgate grunted doubtfully.",
    "He said \u2018Oh well if you think so\u2014\u2019\n\u2018I am sure of it But even then what does that tell us What did Kenneth Marshall feel\nabout his wife\u2019\nColonel Weston said \u2018Takes her death coolly enough.\u2019\nPoirot shook his head in a dissatisfied manner.",
    "Inspector Colgate said \u2018Sometimes these quiet ones are the most violent underneath so\nto speak.",
    "It\u2019s all bottled up.",
    "He may have been madly fond of her\u2014and madly jealous.",
    "But\nhe\u2019s not the kind to show it.\u2019\nPoirot said slowly \u2018That is possible\u2014yes.",
    "He is a very interesting character this Captain\nMarshall.",
    "I interest myself in him greatly.",
    "And in his alibi.\u2019\n\u2018Alibi by typewriter\u2019 said Weston with a short bark of a laugh.",
    "\u2018What have you got to say\nabout that Colgate\u2019\nInspector Colgate screwed up his eyes.",
    "He said \u2018Well you know sir I rather fancy that\nalibi.",
    "It\u2019s not too good if you know what I mean.",
    "It\u2019s\u2014well it\u2019s natural.",
    "And if we find the\nchambermaid was about and did hear the typewriter going well then it seems to me that\nit\u2019s all right and that we\u2019ll have to look elsewhere.\u2019\n\u2018H\u2019m\u2019 said Colonel Weston.",
    "\u2018Where are you going to look\u2019\nVI\nFor a minute or two the three men pondered the question.",
    "Inspector Colgate spoke first.",
    "He said \u2018It boils down to this\u2014was it an outsider or a guest\nat the hotel I\u2019m not eliminating the servants entirely mind but I don\u2019t expect for a\nminute that we\u2019ll find any of them had a hand in it.",
    "No it\u2019s a hotel guest or it\u2019s someone\nfrom right outside.",
    "We\u2019ve got to look at it this way.",
    "First of all\u2014motive.",
    "There\u2019s gain.",
    "The\nonly person to gain by her death was the lady\u2019s husband it seems.",
    "What other motives are\nthere First and foremost\u2014jealousy.",
    "It seems to me\u2014just looking at it\u2014that if ever you\u2019ve\ngot a crime passionnel\u2014he bowed to Poirot this is one.\u2019\nPoirot murmured as he looked up at the ceiling \u2018There are so many passions.\u2019\nInspector Colgate went on \u2018Her husband wouldn\u2019t allow that she had any enemies\u2014real\nenemies that is but I don\u2019t believe for a minute that that\u2019s so I should say that a lady like\nher would\u2014well would make some pretty bad enemies\u2014eh sir what do you say\u2019\n\n68\n\n\fPoirot responded.",
    "He said \u2018Mais oui that is so.",
    "Arlena Marshall would make enemies.",
    "But\nin my opinion the enemy theory is not tenable for you see Inspector Arlena Marshall\u2019s\nenemies would I think as I said just now always be women.\u2019\nColonel Weston grunted and said \u2018Something in that.",
    "It\u2019s the women who\u2019ve got their\nknife into her here all right.\u2019\nPoirot went on.",
    "\u2018It seems to be hardly possible that this crime was committed by a woman.",
    "What does the\nmedical evidence say\u2019\nWeston grunted again.",
    "He said \u2018Neasden\u2019s pretty confident that she was strangled by a\nman.",
    "Big hands\u2014powerful grip.",
    "It\u2019s just possible of course that an unusually athletic\nwoman might have done it\u2014but it\u2019s damned unlikely.\u2019\nPoirot nodded.",
    "\u2018Exactly.",
    "Arsenic in a cup of tea\u2014a box of poisoned chocolates\u2014a knife\u2014even a pistol\u2014\nbut strangulation\u2014no It is a man we have to look for.\u2019\n\u2018And immediately\u2019 he went on \u2018it becomes more difficult.",
    "There are two people here in\nthis hotel who have a motive for wishing Arlena Marshall out of the way\u2014but both of\nthem are women.\u2019\nColonel Weston asked \u2018Redfern\u2019s wife is one of them I suppose\u2019\n\u2018Yes.",
    "Mrs Redfern might have made up her mind to kill Arlena Stuart.",
    "She had let us say\nample cause.",
    "I think too that it would be possible for Mrs Redfern to commit a murder.",
    "But not this kind of murder.",
    "For all her unhappiness and jealousy she is not I should say a\nwoman of strong passions.",
    "In love she would be devoted and loyal\u2014not passionate.",
    "As I\nsaid just now\u2014arsenic in the teacup possibly\u2014strangulation no.",
    "I am sure also that she\nis physically incapable of committing this crime her hands and feet are small below the\naverage.\u2019\nWeston nodded.",
    "He said \u2018This isn\u2019t a woman\u2019s crime.",
    "No a man did this.\u2019\nInspector Colgate coughed.",
    "\u2018Let me put forward a solution sir.",
    "Say that prior to meeting this Mr Redfern the lady had\nhad another affair with someone\u2014call him X.",
    "She turns X down for Mr Redfern.",
    "X is mad\nwith rage and jealousy.",
    "He follows her down here stays somewhere in the\nneighbourhood comes over to the island does her in.",
    "It\u2019s a possibility\u2019\nWeston said \u2018It\u2019s possible all right.",
    "And if it\u2019s true it ought to be easy to prove.",
    "Did he\ncome on foot or in a boat The latter seems more likely.",
    "If so he must have hired a boat\nsomewhere.",
    "You\u2019d better make inquiries.\u2019\n69\n\n\fHe looked across at Poirot.",
    "\u2018What do you think of Colgate\u2019s suggestion\u2019\nPoirot said slowly \u2018It leaves somehow too much to chance.",
    "And besides\u2014somewhere\nthe picture is not true.",
    "I cannot you see imagine this man... the man who is mad with\nrage and jealousy.\u2019\nColgate said \u2018People did go potty about her though sir.",
    "Look at Redfern.\u2019\n\u2018Yes yes...",
    "But all the same\u2014\u2019\nColgate looked at him questioningly.",
    "Poirot shook his head.",
    "He said frowning \u2018Somewhere there is something that we have missed...\u2019\n\n70\n\n\fChapter 6\nColonel Weston was poring over the hotel register.",

    "Mrs Castle\ntells me that the Mastermans and the Cowans come here regularly every summer with\ntheir children.",
    "This morning they went off on an all\u2010day excursion sailing taking lunch with\nthem.",
    "They left just after nine o\u2019clock.",
    "A man called Andrew Baston took them.",
    "We can\ncheck up from him but I think we can put them right out of it.\u2019\nWeston nodded.",
    "\u2018I agree.",
    "Let\u2019s eliminate everyone we can.",
    "Can you give us a pointer on any of the rest of\nthem Poirot\u2019\nPoirot said \u2018Superficially that is easy.",

    "All the talking is done by the lady.",
    "The husband is acquiescent.",
    "He\nplays tennis and golf and has a form of dry humour that is attractive when one gets him to\noneself.\u2019\n\u2018Sounds quite O.K.\u2019\n\u2018Next\u2014the Redferns.",
    "Mr Redfern is young attractive to women a magnificent swimmer a\ngood tennis player and accomplished dancer.",
    "His wife I have already spoken of to you.",
    "She\nis quiet pretty in a washed\u2010out way.",
    "She is I think devoted to her husband.",
    "She has\nsomething that Arlena Marshall did not have.\u2019\n\u2018What is that\u2019\n\u2018Brains.\u2019\nInspector Colgate sighed.",
    "He said \u2018Brains don\u2019t count for much when it comes to an\ninfatuation sir.\u2019\n\u2018Perhaps not.",
    "And yet I do truly believe that in spite of his infatuation for Mrs Marshall\nPatrick Redfern really cares for his wife.\u2019\n\u2018That may be sir.",
    "It wouldn\u2019t be the first time that\u2019s happened.\u2019\nPoirot murmured.",

    "He is apparently a rich man.",

    "He\nwants to be everybody\u2019s friend.",

    "For nobody likes him very much.",
    "And there is\n72\n\n\fsomething else.",
    "Mr Blatt last night asked me a good many questions.",
    "Mr Blatt was uneasy.",
    "Yes there is something not quite right about Mr Blatt.\u2019\nHe paused and went on with a change of voice \u2018Next comes Miss Rosamund Darnley.",
    "Her\nbusiness name is Rose Mond Ltd. She is a celebrated dressmaker.",
    "What can I say of her\nShe has brains and charm and chic.",
    "She is very pleasing to look at.\u2019 He paused and added.",

    "They had not met for some years.\u2019\nWeston asked \u2018Did she know he was going to be down here\u2019\n\u2018She says not.\u2019\nPoirot paused and then went on.",
    "\u2018Who comes next Miss Brewster.",

    "Who\u2019s the Reverend Stephen\nLane\u2019\n\u2018I can only tell you one thing.",
    "He is a man who is in a condition of great nervous tension.",
    "Also he is I think a fanatic.\u2019\nInspector Colgate said \u2018Oh that kind of person.\u2019\nWeston said \u2018And that\u2019s the lot\u2019 He looked at Poirot.",
    "\u2018You seem very lost in thought my\nfriend\u2019\nPoirot said \u2018Yes.",
    "Because you see when Mrs Marshall went off this morning and asked\nme not to tell anyone I had seen her.",
    "I jumped at once in my own mind to a certain\nconclusion.",
    "I thought that her friendship with Patrick Redfern had made trouble between\nher and her husband.",
    "I thought that she was going to meet Patrick Redfern somewhere\nand that she did not want her husband to know where she was.\u2019\nHe paused.",
    "\u2018But that you see was where I was wrong.",
    "Because although her husband appeared\nalmost immediately on the beach and asked if I had seen her Patrick Redfern arrived\nalso\u2014and was most patently and obviously looking for her And therefore my friends I\nam asking myself who was it that Arlena Marshall went off to meet\u2019\n73\n\n\fInspector Colgate said \u2018That fits in with my idea.",
    "A man from London or somewhere.\u2019\nHercule Poirot shook his head.",
    "He said \u2018But my friend according to your theory Arlena\nMarshall had broken with this mythical man.",
    "Why then should she take such trouble and\npains to meet him\u2019\nInspector Colgate shook his head.",
    "He said \u2018Who do you think it was\u2019\n\u2018That is just what I cannot imagine.",
    "We have just read through the list of hotel guests.",
    "They are all middle\u2010aged\u2014dull.",
    "Which of them would Arlena Marshall prefer to Patrick\nRedfern No that is impossible.",
    "And yet all the same she did go to meet someone\u2014and\nthat someone was not Patrick Redfern.\u2019\nWeston murmured \u2018You don\u2019t think she just went off by herself\u2019\nPoirot shook his head.",
    "\u2018Mon cher\u2019 he said.",
    "\u2018It is very evident that you never met the dead woman.",
    "Somebody\nonce wrote a learned treatise on the difference that solitary confinement would mean to\nBeau Brummel or to a man like Newton.",
    "Arlena Marshall my dear friend would practically\nnot exist in solitude.",
    "She only lived in the light of a man\u2019s admiration.",
    "No Arlena Marshall\nwent to meet someone this morning.",
    "Who was it\u2019\nII\nColonel Weston sighed shook his head and said \u2018Well we can go into theories later.",
    "Got\nto get through these interviews now.",
    "Got to get it down in black and white where\neveryone was.",
    "I suppose we\u2019d better see the Marshall girl now.",
    "She might be able to tell\nus something useful.\u2019\nLinda Marshall came into the room clumsily knocking against the doorpost.",
    "She was\nbreathing quickly and the pupils of her eyes were dilated.",
    "She looked like a startled young\ncolt.",
    "Colonel Weston felt a kindly impulse towards her.",
    "He thought \u2018Poor kid\u2014she\u2019s nothing but a kid after all.",
    "This must have been a pretty bad\nshock to her.\u2019\nHe drew up a chair and said in a reassuring voice.",
    "\u2018Sorry to put you through this Miss\u2014Linda isn\u2019t it\u2019\n\u2018Yes Linda.\u2019\nHer voice had that indrawn breathy quality that is often characteristic of schoolgirls.",
    "Her\nhands rested helplessly on the table in front of him\u2014pathetic hands big and red with\nlarge bones and long wrists.",
    "Weston thought \u2018A kid oughtn\u2019t to be mixed up in this sort of thing.\u2019\n74\n\n\fHe said reassuringly.",
    "\u2018There\u2019s nothing very alarming about all this.",
    "We just want you to tell us anything you\nknow that might be useful that\u2019s all.\u2019\nLinda said \u2018You mean\u2014about Arlena\u2019\n\u2018Yes.",
    "Did you see her this morning at all\u2019\nThe girl shook her head.",
    "\u2018No.",
    "Arlena always gets down rather late.",
    "She has breakfast in bed.\u2019\nHercule Poirot said \u2018And you Mademoiselle\u2019\n\u2018Oh I get up.",
    "Breakfast in bed\u2019s so stuffy.\u2019\nWeston said \u2018Will you tell us what you did this morning\u2019\n\u2018Well I had a bathe first and then breakfast and then I went with Mrs Redfern to Gull\nCove.\u2019\nWeston said \u2018What time did you and Mrs Redfern start\u2019\n\u2018She said she\u2019d be waiting for me in the hall at half\u2010past ten.",
    "I was afraid I was going to be\nlate but it was all right.",
    "We started off at about three minutes to the half\u2010hour.\u2019\nPoirot said \u2018And what did you do at Gull Cove\u2019\n\u2018Oh I oiled myself and sunbathed and Mrs Redfern sketched.",
    "Then later I went into the\nsea and Christine went back to the hotel to get changed for tennis.\u2019\nWeston said keeping his voice quite casual \u2018Do you remember what time that was\u2019\n\u2018When Mrs Redfern went back to the hotel Quarter to twelve.\u2019\n\u2018Sure of that time\u2014quarter to twelve\u2019\nLinda opening her eyes wide said \u2018Oh yes.",
    "I looked at my watch.\u2019\n\u2018The watch you have on now\u2019\nLinda glanced down at her wrist.",
    "\u2018Yes.\u2019\nWeston said \u2018Mind if I see\u2019\n75\n\n\fShe held out her wrist.",
    "He compared the watch with his own and with the hotel clock on\nthe wall.",
    "He said smiling \u2018Correct to a second.",
    "And after that you had a bathe\u2019\n\u2018Yes.\u2019\n\u2018And you got back to the hotel\u2014when\u2019\n\u2018Just about one o\u2019clock.",
    "And\u2014and then\u2014I heard\u2014about Arlena...\u2019\nHer voice changed.",
    "Colonel Weston said \u2018Did you\u2014er\u2014get on with your stepmother all right\u2019\nShe looked at him for a minute without replying.",
    "Then she said \u2018Oh yes.\u2019\nPoirot asked \u2018Did you like her Mademoiselle\u2019\nLinda said again \u2018Oh yes.\u2019 She added \u2018Arlena was quite kind to me.\u2019\nWeston said with rather uneasy facetiousness.",
    "\u2018Not the cruel stepmother eh\u2019\nLinda shook her head without smiling.",
    "Weston said \u2018That\u2019s good.",
    "That\u2019s good.",
    "Sometimes you know there\u2019s a bit of difficulty in\nfamilies\u2014jealousy\u2014all that.",
    "Girl and her father great pals and then she resents it a bit\nwhen he\u2019s all wrapped up in the new wife.",
    "You didn\u2019t feel like that eh\u2019\nLinda stared at him.",
    "She said with obvious sincerity \u2018Oh no.\u2019\nWeston said \u2018I suppose your father was\u2014er\u2014very wrapped up in her\u2019\nLinda said simply \u2018I don\u2019t know.\u2019\nWeston went on \u2018All sorts of difficulties as I say arise in families.",
    "Quarrels\u2014rows\u2014that\nsort of thing.",
    "If husband and wife get ratty with each other that\u2019s a bit awkward for a\ndaughter too.",
    "Anything of that sort\u2019\nLinda said clearly \u2018Do you mean did Father and Arlena quarrel\u2019\n\u2018Well\u2014yes.\u2019\nWeston thought to himself \u2018Rotten business\u2014questioning a child about her father.",
    "Why is\none a policeman Damn it all it\u2019s got to be done though.\u2019\n76\n\n\fLinda said positively \u2018Oh no.\u2019 She added \u2018Father doesn\u2019t quarrel with people.",
    "He\u2019s not like\nthat at all.\u2019\nWeston said \u2018Now Miss Linda I want you to think very carefully.",
    "Have you any idea at all\nwho might have killed your stepmother Is there anything you\u2019ve ever heard or anything\nyou know that could help us on that point\u2019\nLinda was silent a minute.",
    "She seemed to be giving the question a serious unhurried\nconsideration.",
    "She said at last.",
    "\u2018No I don\u2019t know who could have wanted to kill Arlena.\u2019 She added \u2018Except of course\nMrs Redfern.\u2019\nWeston said \u2018You think Mrs Redfern wanted to kill her Why\u2019\nLinda said \u2018Because her husband was in love with Arlena.",
    "But I don\u2019t think she would\nreally want to kill her.",
    "I mean she\u2019d just feel that she wished she was dead\u2014and that isn\u2019t\nthe same thing at all is it\u2019\nPoirot said gently \u2018No it is not at all the same.\u2019\nLinda nodded.",
    "A queer sort of spasm passed across her face.",
    "She said \u2018And anyway Mrs\nRedfern could never do a thing like that\u2014kill anybody.",
    "She isn\u2019t\u2014she isn\u2019t violent if you\nknow what I mean.\u2019\nWeston and Poirot nodded.",
    "The latter said \u2018I know exactly what you mean my child and I\nagree with you.",
    "Mrs Redfern is not of those who as your saying goes \u201csees red\u201d.",
    "She\nwould not be\u2019\u2014he leaned back half closing his eyes picking his words with care\u2014\u2018shaken\nby a storm of feeling\u2014seeing life narrowing in front of her\u2014seeing a hated face\u2014a hated\nwhite neck\u2014feeling her hands clench\u2014longing to feel them press into flesh\u2014\u2019\nHe stopped.",
    "Linda moved jerkily back from the table.",
    "She said in a trembling voice \u2018Can I go now Is\nthat all\u2019\nColonel Weston said \u2018Yes yes that\u2019s all.",
    "Thank you Miss Linda.\u2019\nHe got up to open the door for her.",
    "Then came back to the table and lit a cigarette.",
    "\u2018Phew\u2019 he said.",
    "\u2018Not a nice job ours.",
    "I can tell you I felt a bit of a cad questioning that\nchild about the relations between her father and her stepmother.",
    "More or less inviting a\ndaughter to put a rope round her father\u2019s neck.",
    "All the same it had to be done.",
    "Murder is\nmurder.",
    "And she\u2019s the person most likely to know the truth of things.",
    "I\u2019m rather thankful\nthough that she\u2019d nothing to tell us in that line.\u2019\nPoirot said \u2018Yes I thought you were.\u2019\n77\n\n\fWeston said with an embarrassed cough \u2018By the way Poirot you went a bit far I thought\nat the end.",
    "All that hands sinking into flesh business Not quite the sort of idea to put into\na kid\u2019s head.\u2019\nHercule Poirot looked at him with thoughtful eyes.",
    "He said \u2018So you thought I put ideas\ninto her head\u2019\n\u2018Well didn\u2019t you Come now.\u2019\nPoirot shook his head.",
    "Weston sheered away from the point.",
    "He said \u2018On the whole we got very little useful stuff\nout of her.",
    "Except a more or less complete alibi for the Redfern woman.",
    "If they were\ntogether from half\u2010past ten to a quarter to twelve that lets Christine Redfern out of it.",
    "Exit\nthe jealous wife suspect.\u2019\nPoirot said \u2018There are better reasons than that for leaving Mrs Redfern out of it.",
    "It would\nI am convinced be physically impossible and mentally impossible for her to strangle\nanyone.",
    "She is cold rather than warm blooded capable of deep devotion and unswerving\nconstancy but not of hot blooded passion or rage.",
    "Moreover her hands are far too small\nand delicate.\u2019\nColgate said \u2018I agree with M. Poirot.",
    "She\u2019s out of it.",
    "Dr Neasden says it was a full\u2010sized pair\nof hands that throttled that dame.\u2019\nWeston said \u2018Well I suppose we\u2019d better see the Redferns next.",
    "I expect he\u2019s recovered a\nbit from the shock now.\u2019\nIII\nPatrick Redfern had recovered full composure by now.",
    "He looked pale and haggard and\nsuddenly very young but his manner was quite composed.",
    "\u2018You are Mr Patrick Redfern of Crossgates Seldon Princes Risborough\u2019\n\u2018Yes.\u2019\n\u2018How long had you known Mrs Marshall\u2019\nPatrick Redfern hesitated then said \u2018Three months.\u2019\nWeston went on \u2018Captain Marshall has told us that you and she met casually at a cocktail\nparty.",
    "Is that right\u2019\n\u2018Yes that\u2019s how it came about.\u2019\nWeston said \u2018Captain Marshall has implied that until you both met down here you did not\nknow each other well.",
    "Is that the truth Mr Redfern\u2019\n78\n\n\fAgain Patrick Redfern hesitated a minute.",
    "Then he said \u2018Well\u2014not exactly.",
    "As a matter of\nfact I saw a fair amount of her one way and another.\u2019\n\u2018Without Captain Marshall\u2019s knowledge\u2019\nRedfern flushed slightly.",
    "He said \u2018I don\u2019t know whether he knew about it or not.\u2019\nHercule Poirot spoke.",
    "He murmured \u2018And was it also without your wife\u2019s knowledge Mr\nRedfern\u2019\n\u2018I believe I mentioned to my wife that I had met the famous Arlena Stuart.\u2019\nPoirot persisted.",
    "\u2018But she did not know how often you were seeing her\u2019\n\u2018Well perhaps not.\u2019\nWeston said \u2018Did you and Mrs Marshall arrange to meet down here\u2019\nRedfern was silent a minute or two.",
    "Then he shrugged his shoulders.",
    "\u2018Oh well\u2019 he said \u2018I suppose it\u2019s bound to come out now.",
    "It\u2019s no good my fencing with\nyou.",
    "I was crazy about the woman\u2014mad\u2014infatuated\u2014anything you like.",
    "She wanted me\nto come down here.",
    "I demurred a bit and then I agreed.",
    "I\u2014I\u2014well I would have agreed to\ndo any mortal thing she liked.",
    "She had that kind of effect on people.\u2019\nHercule Poirot murmured \u2018You paint a very clear picture of her.",
    "She was the eternal Circe.",
    "Just that\u2019\nPatrick Redfern said bitterly \u2018She turned men into swine all right\u2019 He went on \u2018I\u2019m being\nfrank with you gentlemen.",
    "I\u2019m not going to hide anything.",
    "What\u2019s the use As I say I was\ninfatuated with her.",
    "Whether she cared for me or not I don\u2019t know.",
    "She pretended to but\nI think she was one of those women who lose interest in a man once they\u2019ve got him body\nand soul.",
    "She knew she\u2019d got me all right.",
    "This morning when I found her there on the\nbeach dead it was as though\u2019\u2014he paused\u2014\u2018as though something had hit me straight\nbetween the eyes.",
    "I was dazed\u2014knocked out\u2019\nPoirot leaned forward.",
    "\u2018And now\u2019\nPatrick Redfern met his eyes squarely.",
    "He said \u2018I\u2019ve told you the truth.",
    "What I want to ask is this\u2014how much of it has got to be\nmade public It\u2019s not as though it could have any bearing on her death.",
    "And if it all comes\nout it\u2019s going to be pretty rough on my wife.\u2019\n\u2018Oh I know\u2019 he went on quickly.",
    "\u2018You think I haven\u2019t thought much about her up to now\nPerhaps that\u2019s true.",
    "But though I may sound the worst kind of hypocrite the real truth is\n79\n\n\fthat I care for my wife\u2014care for her very deeply.",
    "The other\u2019\u2014he twitched his shoulders\u2014\n\u2018it was a madness\u2014the kind of idiotic fool thing men do\u2014but Christine is different.",
    "She\u2019s\nreal.",
    "Badly as I\u2019ve treated her I\u2019ve known all along deep down that she was the person\nwho really counted.\u2019 He paused\u2014sighed\u2014and said rather pathetically \u2018I wish I could make\nyou believe that.\u2019\nHercule Poirot leant forward.",
    "He said \u2018But I do believe it.",
    "Yes yes I do believe it\u2019\nPatrick Redfern looked at him gratefully.",
    "He said \u2018Thank you.\u2019\nColonel Weston cleared his throat.",
    "He said \u2018You may take it Mr Redfern that we shall not\ngo into irrelevancies.",
    "If your infatuation for Mrs Marshall played no part in the murder\nthen there will be no point in dragging it into the case.",
    "But what you don\u2019t seem to realize\nis that that\u2014er\u2014intimacy\u2014may have a very direct bearing on the murder.",
    "It might\nestablish you understand a motive for the crime.\u2019\nPatrick Redfern said \u2018Motive\u2019\nWeston said \u2018Yes Mr Redfern motive Captain Marshall perhaps was unaware of the\naffair.",
    "Suppose that he suddenly found out\u2019\nRedfern said \u2018Oh God You mean he got wise and\u2014and killed her\u2019\nThe Chief Constable said rather dryly \u2018That solution had not occurred to you\u2019\nRedfern shook his head.",
    "He said \u2018No\u2014funny.",
    "I never thought of it.",
    "You see Marshall\u2019s\nsuch a quiet chap.",
    "I\u2014oh it doesn\u2019t seem likely.\u2019\nWeston asked \u2018What was Mrs Marshall\u2019s attitude to her husband in all this Was she\u2014\nwell uneasy\u2014in case it should come to his ears Or was she indifferent\u2019\nRedfern said slowly \u2018She was\u2014a bit nervous.",
    "She didn\u2019t want him to suspect anything.\u2019\n\u2018Did she seem afraid of him\u2019\n\u2018Afraid.",
    "No I wouldn\u2019t say that.\u2019\nPoirot murmured \u2018Excuse me M. Redfern there was not at any time the question of a\ndivorce\u2019\nPatrick Redfern shook his head decisively.",
    "\u2018Oh no there was no question of anything like that.",
    "There was Christine you see.",
    "And\nArlena I am sure never thought of such a thing.",
    "She was perfectly satisfied married to\nMarshall.",
    "He\u2019s\u2014well rather a big bug in his way\u2014\u2019 He smiled suddenly.",
    "\u2018County\u2014all that\nsort of thing and quite well off.",
    "She never thought of me as a possible husband.",
    "No I was\njust one of a succession of poor mutts\u2014just something to pass the time with.",
    "I knew that\nall along and yet queerly enough it didn\u2019t alter my feeling towards her...\u2019\n80\n\n\fHis voice trailed off.",
    "He sat there thinking.",
    "Weston recalled him to the needs of the moment.",
    "\u2018Now Mr Redfern had you any particular appointment with Mrs Marshall this morning\u2019\nPatrick Redfern looked slightly puzzled.",
    "He said \u2018Not a particular appointment no.",
    "We usually met every morning on the beach.",
    "We used to paddle about on floats.\u2019\n\u2018Were you surprised not to find Mrs Marshall there this morning\u2019\n\u2018Yes I was.",
    "Very surprised.",
    "I couldn\u2019t understand it at all.\u2019\n\u2018What did you think\u2019\n\u2018Well I didn\u2019t know what to think.",
    "I mean all the time I thought she would be coming.\u2019\n\u2018If she were keeping an appointment elsewhere you had no idea with whom that\nappointment might be\u2019\nPatrick Redfern merely stared and shook his head.",
    "\u2018When you had a rendezvous with Mrs Marshall where did you meet\u2019\n\u2018Well sometimes I\u2019d meet her in the afternoon down at Gull Cove.",
    "You see the sun is off\nGull Cove in the afternoon and so there aren\u2019t usually many people there.",
    "We met there\nonce or twice.\u2019\n\u2018Never on the other cove\u2019 Pixy Cove\u2019\n\u2018No.",
    "You see Pixy Cove faces west and people go round there in boats or on floats in the\nafternoon.",
    "We never tried to meet in the morning.",
    "It would have been too noticeable.",
    "In\nthe afternoon people go and have a sleep or mouch around and nobody knows much\nwhere any one else is.\u2019\nWeston nodded.",
    "Patrick Redfern went on \u2018After dinner of course on the fine nights we used to go off for\na stroll together to different parts of the island.\u2019\nHercule Poirot murmured \u2018Ah yes\u2019 and Patrick Redfern shot him an inquiring glance.",
    "Weston said \u2018Then you can give us no help whatsoever as to the cause that took Mrs\nMarshall to Pixy Cove this morning\u2019\n\n81\n\n\fRedfern shook his head.",
    "He said and his voice sounded honestly bewildered \u2018I haven\u2019t the\nfaintest idea It wasn\u2019t like Arlena.\u2019\nWeston said \u2018Had she any friends down here staying in the neighbourhood\u2019\n\u2018Not that I know of.",
    "Oh I\u2019m sure she hadn\u2019t.\u2019\n\u2018Now Mr Redfern I want you to think very carefully.",
    "You knew Mrs Marshall in London.",
    "You must be acquainted with various members of her circle.",
    "Is there anyone you know of\nwho could have had a grudge against her Someone for instance whom you may have\nsupplanted in her fancy\u2019\nPatrick Redfern thought for some minutes.",
    "Then he shook his head.",
    "\u2018Honestly\u2019 he said.",
    "\u2018I can\u2019t think of anyone.\u2019\nColonel Weston drummed with his fingers on the table.",
    "He said at last \u2018Well that\u2019s that.",
    "We seem to be left with three possibilities.",
    "That of an\nunknown killer\u2014some mono\u2010maniac\u2014who happened to be in the neighbourhood\u2014and\nthat\u2019s a pretty tall order\u2014\u2019\nRedfern said interrupting \u2018And yet surely it\u2019s by far the most likely explanation.\u2019\nWeston shook his head.",
    "He said \u2018This isn\u2019t one of the \u201clonely copse\u201d murders.",
    "This cove\nplace was pretty inaccessible.",
    "Either the man would have to come up from the causeway\npast the hotel over the top of the island and down by that ladder contraption or else he\ncame there by boat.",
    "Either way is unlikely for a casual killing.\u2019\nPatrick Redfern said \u2018You said there were three possibilities.\u2019\n\u2018Um\u2014yes\u2019 said the Chief Constable.",
    "\u2018That\u2019s to say there were two people on this island\nwho had a motive for killing her.",
    "Her husband for one and your wife for another.\u2019\nRedfern stared at him.",
    "He looked dumbfounded.",
    "He said \u2018My wife Christine D\u2019you mean\nthat Christine had anything to do with this\u2019\nHe got up and stood there stammering slightly in his incoherent haste to get the words\nout.",
    "\u2018You\u2019re mad\u2014quite mad\u2014Christine Why it\u2019s impossible.",
    "It\u2019s laughable\u2019\nWeston said \u2018All the same Mr Redfern jealousy is a very powerful motive.",
    "Women who\nare jealous lose control of themselves completely.\u2019\nRedfern said earnestly.",
    "82\n\n\f\u2018Not Christine.",
    "She\u2019s\u2014oh she\u2019s not like that.",
    "She was unhappy yes.",
    "But she\u2019s not the kind\nof person to\u2014Oh there\u2019s no violence in her.\u2019\nHercule Poirot nodded thoughtfully.",
    "Violence.",
    "The same word that Linda Marshall had\nused.",
    "As before he agreed with the sentiment.",
    "\u2018Besides\u2019 went on Redfern confidently.",
    "\u2018It would be absurd.",
    "Arlena was twice as strong\nphysically as Christine.",
    "I doubt if Christine could strangle a kitten\u2014certainly not a strong\nwiry creature like Arlena.",
    "And then Christine could never have got down that ladder to the\nbeach.",
    "She has no head for that sort of thing.",
    "And\u2014oh the whole thing is fantastic\u2019\nColonel Weston scratched his ear tentatively.",
    "\u2018Well\u2019 he said.",
    "\u2018Put like that it doesn\u2019t seem likely.",
    "I grant you that.",
    "But motive\u2019s the first\nthing we\u2019ve got to look for.\u2019 He added \u2018Motive and opportunity.\u2019\nIV\nWhen Redfern had left the room the Chief Constable observed with a slight smile \u2018Didn\u2019t\nthink it necessary to tell the fellow his wife had got an alibi.",
    "Wanted to hear what he\u2019d\nhave to say to the idea.",
    "Shook him up a bit didn\u2019t it\u2019\nHercule Poirot murmured \u2018The arguments he advanced were quite as strong as any alibi.\u2019\n\u2018Yes.",
    "Oh she didn\u2019t do it She couldn\u2019t have done it\u2014physically impossible as you said.",
    "Marshall could have done it\u2014but apparently he didn\u2019t.\u2019\nInspector Colgate coughed.",
    "He said \u2018Excuse me sir I\u2019ve been thinking about that alibi.",
    "It\u2019s\npossible you know if he\u2019d thought this thing out that those letters were got ready\nbeforehand.\u2019\nWeston said \u2018That\u2019s a good idea.",
    "We must look into\u2014\u2019\nHe broke off as Christine Redfern entered the room.",
    "She was as always calm and a little precise in manner.",
    "She was wearing a white tennis\nfrock and a pale blue pullover.",
    "It accentuated her fair rather anaemic prettiness.",
    "Yet\nHercule Poirot thought to himself it was neither a silly face nor a weak one.",
    "It had plenty\nof resolution courage and good sense.",
    "He nodded appreciatively.",
    "Colonel Weston thought \u2018Nice little woman.",
    "Bit wishy\u2010washy perhaps.",
    "A lot too good for\nthat philandering young ass of a husband of hers.",
    "Oh well the boy\u2019s young.",
    "Women\nusually make a fool of you once\u2019\nHe said \u2018Sit down Mrs Redfern.",
    "We\u2019ve got to go through a certain amount of routine you\nsee.",
    "Asking everybody for an account of their movements this morning.",
    "Just for our\nrecords.\u2019\n83\n\n\fChristine Redfern nodded.",
    "She said in her quiet precise voice.",
    "\u2018Oh yes I quite understand.",
    "Where do you want me to begin\u2019\nHercule Poirot said \u2018As early as possible Madame.",
    "What did you do when you first got up\nthis morning\u2019\nChristine said \u2018Let me see.",
    "On my way down to breakfast I went into Linda Marshall\u2019s\nroom and fixed up with her to go to Gull Cove this morning.",
    "We agreed to meet in the\nlounge at half\u2010past ten.\u2019\nPoirot asked \u2018You did not bathe before breakfast Madame\u2019\n\u2018No.",
    "I very seldom do.\u2019 She smiled.",
    "\u2018I like the sea well warmed before I get into it.",
    "I\u2019m\nrather a chilly person.\u2019\n\u2018But your husband bathes then\u2019\n\u2018Oh yes.",
    "Nearly always.\u2019\n\u2018And Mrs Marshall she also\u2019\nA change came over Christine\u2019s voice.",
    "It became cold and almost acrid.",
    "She said \u2018Oh no Mrs Marshall was the sort of person who never made an appearance\nbefore the middle of the morning.\u2019\nWith an air of confusion Hercule Poirot said \u2018Pardon Madame I interrupted you.",
    "You\nwere saying that you went to Miss Linda Marshall\u2019s room.",
    "What time was that\u2019\n\u2018Let me see\u2014half\u2010past eight\u2014no a little later.\u2019\n\u2018And was Miss Marshall up then\u2019\n\u2018Oh yes she had been out.\u2019\n\u2018Out\u2019\n\u2018Yes she said she\u2019d been bathing.\u2019\nThere was a faint\u2014a very faint note of embarrassment in Christine\u2019s voice.",
    "It puzzled\nHercule Poirot.",
    "Weston said \u2018And then\u2019\n\u2018Then I went down to breakfast.\u2019\n84\n\n\f\u2018And after breakfast\u2019\n\u2018I went upstairs collected my sketching box and sketching book and we started out.\u2019\n\u2018You and Miss Linda Marshall\u2019\n\u2018Yes.\u2019\n\u2018What time was that\u2019\n\u2018I think it was just on half\u2010past ten.\u2019\n\u2018And what did you do\u2019\n\u2018We went to Gull Cove.",
    "You know the cove on the east side of the island.",
    "We settled\nourselves there.",
    "I did a sketch and Linda sunbathed.\u2019\n\u2018What time did you leave the cove\u2019\n\u2018At a quarter to twelve.",
    "I was playing tennis at twelve and had to change.\u2019\n\u2018You had your watch with you\u2019\n\u2018No as a matter of fact I hadn\u2019t.",
    "I asked Linda the time.\u2019\n\u2018I see.",
    "And then\u2019\n\u2018I packed up my sketching things and went back to the hotel.\u2019\nPoirot said \u2018And Mademoiselle Linda\u2019\n\u2018Linda\u2019 Oh Linda went into the sea.\u2019\nPoirot said \u2018Were you far from the sea where you were sitting\u2019\n\u2018Well we were well above high\u2010water mark.",
    "Just under the cliff\u2014so that I could be a little\nin the shade and Linda in the sun.\u2019\nPoirot said \u2018Did Linda Marshall actually enter the sea before you left the beach\u2019\nChristine frowned a little in the effort to remember.",
    "She said \u2018Let me see.",
    "She ran down\nthe beach\u2014I fastened my box\u2014Yes I heard her splashing in the waves as I was on the\npath up the cliff.\u2019\n\u2018You are sure of that Madame That she really entered the sea\u2019\n\u2018Oh yes.\u2019\n85\n\n\fShe stared at him in surprise.",
    "Colonel Weston also stared at him.",
    "Then he said \u2018Go on Mrs Redfern.\u2019\n\u2018I went back to the hotel changed and went to the tennis courts where I met the others.\u2019\n\u2018Who were\u2019\n\u2018Captain Marshall Mr Gardener and Miss Darnley.",
    "We played two sets.",
    "We were just going\nin again when the news came about\u2014about Mrs Marshall.\u2019\nHercule Poirot leant forward.",
    "He said \u2018And what did you think Madame when you heard\nthat news\u2019\n\u2018What did I think\u2019\nHer face showed a faint distaste for the question.",
    "\u2018Yes.\u2019\nChristine Redfern said slowly \u2018It was\u2014a horrible thing to happen.\u2019\n\u2018Ah yes your fastidiousness was revolted.",
    "I understand that.",
    "But what did it mean to\nyou\u2014personally\u2019\nShe gave him a quick look\u2014a look of appeal.",
    "He responded to it.",
    "He said in a matter\u2010of\u2010\nfact voice.",
    "\u2018I am appealing to you Madame as a woman of intelligence with plenty of good sense and\njudgment.",
    "You had doubtless during your stay here formed an opinion of Mrs Marshall of\nthe kind of woman she was\u2019\nChristine said cautiously \u2018I suppose one always does that more or less when one is staying\nin hotels.\u2019\n\u2018Certainly it is the natural thing to do.",
    "So I ask you Madame were you really very\nsurprised at the manner of her death\u2019\nChristine said slowly \u2018I think I see what you mean.",
    "No I was not perhaps surprised.",
    "Shocked yes.",
    "But she was the kind of woman\u2014\u2019\nPoirot finished the sentence for her.",
    "\u2018She was the kind of woman to whom such a thing might happen...",
    "Yes Madame that is\nthe truest and most significant thing that has been said in this room this morning.",
    "Laying\n86\n\n\fall\u2014er he stressed it carefully personal feeling aside what did you really think of the late\nMrs Marshall\u2019\nChristine Redfern said calmly \u2018Is it really worth while going into all that now\u2019\n\u2018I think it might be yes.\u2019\n\u2018Well what shall I say\u2019 Her fair skin was suddenly suffused with colour.",
    "The careful poise\nof her manner was relaxed.",
    "For a short space the natural raw woman looked out.",
    "\u2018She\u2019s\nthe kind of woman that to my mind is absolutely worthless She did nothing to justify her\nexistence.",
    "She had no mind\u2014no brains.",
    "She thought of nothing but men and clothes and\nadmiration.",
    "Useless a parasite She was attractive to men I suppose\u2014Oh of course she\nwas.",
    "And she lived for that kind of life.",
    "And so I suppose I wasn\u2019t really surprised at her\ncoming to a sticky end.",
    "She was the sort of woman who would be mixed up with\neverything sordid\u2014blackmail\u2014jealousy\u2014violence\u2014every kind of crude emotion.",
    "She\u2014\nshe appealed to the worst in people.\u2019\nShe stopped panting a little.",
    "Her rather short top lip lifted itself in a kind of fastidious\ndisgust.",
    "It occured to Colonel Weston that you could not have found a more complete\ncontrast to Arlena Stuart than Christine Redfern.",
    "It also occurred to him that if you were\nmarried to Christine Redfern the atmosphere might be so rarefied that the Arlena Stuarts\nof this world would hold a particular attraction for you.",
    "And then immediately following on these thoughts a single word out of the words she\nhad spoken fastened on his attention with particular intensity.",
    "He leaned forward and said \u2018Mrs Redfern why in speaking of her did you mention the\nword blackmail\u2019\n\n87\n\n\f88\n\n\fChapter 7\nChristine stared at him not seeming at once to take in what he meant.",
    "She answered\nalmost mechanically.",
    "\u2018I suppose\u2014because she was being blackmailed.",
    "She was the sort of person who would\nbe.\u2019\nColonel Weston said earnestly \u2018But\u2014do you know she was being blackmailed\u2019\nA faint colour rose in the girl\u2019s cheeks.",
    "She said rather awkwardly \u2018As a matter of fact I do\nhappen to know it.",
    "I\u2014I overheard something.\u2019\n\u2018Will you explain Mrs Redfern\u2019\nFlushing still more Christine Redfern said \u2018I\u2014I didn\u2019t mean to overhear.",
    "It was an\naccident.",
    "It was two\u2014no three nights ago.",
    "We were playing bridge.\u2019 She turned towards\nPoirot.",
    "\u2018You remember My husband and I M. Poirot and Miss Darnley.",
    "I was dummy.",
    "It\nwas very stuffy in the card room and I slipped out of the window for a breath of fresh air.",
    "I\nwent down towards the beach and I suddenly heard voices.",
    "One\u2014it was Arlena\nMarshall\u2019s\u2014I knew it at once\u2014said \u201cIt\u2019s no good pressing me.",
    "I can\u2019t get any more money\nnow.",
    "My husband will suspect something.\u201d And then a man\u2019s voice said \u201cI\u2019m not taking\nany excuses.",
    "You\u2019ve got to cough up.\u201d And then Arlena Marshall said \u201cYou blackmailing\nbrute\u201d And the man said \u201cBrute or not you\u2019ll pay up my lady.\u201d \u2019\nChristine paused.",
    "\u2018I\u2019d turned back and a minute after Arlena Marshall rushed past me.",
    "She looked\u2014well\nfrightfully upset.\u2019\nWeston said \u2018And the man Do you know who he was\u2019\nChristine Redfern shook her head.",
    "She said \u2018He was keeping his voice low.",
    "I barely heard what he said.\u2019\n\u2018It didn\u2019t suggest the voice to you of anyone you knew\u2019\nShe thought again but once more shook her head.",
    "She said \u2018No I don\u2019t know.",
    "It was gruff\nand low.",
    "It\u2014oh it might have been anybody\u2019s.\u2019\nColonel Weston said \u2018Thank you Mrs Redfern.\u2019\nII\nWhen the door had closed behind Christine Redfern Inspector Colgate said \u2018Now we are\ngetting somewhere\u2019\n89\n\n\fWeston said \u2018You think so eh\u2019\n\u2018Well it\u2019s suggestive sir you can\u2019t get away from it.",
    "Somebody in this hotel was\nblackmailing the lady.\u2019\nPoirot murmured \u2018But it is not the wicked blackmailer who lies dead.",
    "It is the victim.\u2019\n\u2018That\u2019s a bit of a setback I agree\u2019 said the Inspector.",
    "\u2018Blackmailers aren\u2019t in the habit of\nbumping off their victims.",
    "But what it does give us is this it suggests a reason for Mrs\nMarshall\u2019s curious behaviour this morning.",
    "She\u2019d got a rendezvous with this fellow who\nwas blackmailing her and she didn\u2019t want either her husband or Redfern to know about\nit.\u2019\n\u2018It certainly explains that point\u2019 agreed Poirot.",
    "Inspector Colgate went on \u2018And think of the place chosen.",
    "The very spot for the purpose.",
    "The lady goes off in her float.",
    "That\u2019s natural enough.",
    "It\u2019s what she does every day.",
    "She\ngoes round to Pixy Cove where no one ever goes in the morning and which will be a nice\nquiet place for an interview.\u2019\nPoirot said \u2018But yes I too was struck by that point.",
    "It is as you say an ideal spot for a\nrendezvous.",
    "It is deserted it is only accessible from the land side by descending a vertical\nsteel ladder which is not everybody\u2019s money bien entendu.",
    "Moreover most of the beach\nis invisible from above because of the overhanging cliff.",
    "And it has another advantage.",
    "Mr\nRedfern told me of that one day.",
    "There is a cave on it the entrance to which is not easy to\nfind but where anyone could wait unseen.\u2019\nWeston said \u2018Of course the Pixy\u2019s Cave\u2014remember hearing about it.\u2019\nInspector Colgate said \u2018Haven\u2019t heard it spoken of for years though.",
    "We\u2019d better have a\nlook inside it.",
    "Never know we might find a pointer of some kind.\u2019\nWeston said \u2018Yes you\u2019re right Colgate we\u2019ve got the solution to part one of the puzzle.",
    "Why did Mrs Marshall go to Pixy\u2019s Cove We want the other half of that solution though.",
    "Who did she go there to meet Presumably someone staying in this hotel.",
    "None of them\nfitted as a lover\u2014but a blackmailer\u2019s a different proposition.\u2019\nHe drew the register towards him.",
    "\u2018Excluding the waiters boots etc.",
    "whom I don\u2019t think likely we\u2019ve got the following.",
    "The\nAmerican\u2014Gardener Major Barry Mr Horace Blatt and the Reverend Stephen Lane.\u2019\nInspector Colgate said \u2018We can narrow it down a bit sir.",
    "We might almost rule out the\nAmerican I think.",
    "He was on the beach all the morning.",
    "That\u2019s so isn\u2019t it M. Poirot\u2019\nPoirot replied \u2018He was absent for a short time when he fetched a skein of wool for his\nwife.\u2019\n90\n\n\fColgate said \u2018Oh well we needn\u2019t count that.\u2019\nWeston said \u2018And what about the other three\u2019\n\u2018Major Barry went out at ten o\u2019clock this morning.",
    "He returned at one\u2010thirty.",
    "Mr Lane was\nearlier still.",
    "He breakfasted at eight.",
    "Said he was going for a tramp.",
    "Mr Blatt went off for a\nsail at nine\u2010thirty same as he does most days.",
    "Neither of them are back yet.\u2019\n\u2018A sail eh\u2019 Colonel Weston\u2019s voice was thoughtful.",
    "Inspector Colgate\u2019s voice was responsive.",
    "He said \u2018Might fit in rather well sir.\u2019\nWeston said \u2018Well we\u2019ll have a word with this Major bloke\u2014and let me see who else is\nthere Rosamund Darnley.",
    "And there\u2019s the Brewster woman who found the body with\nRedfern.",
    "What\u2019s she like Colgate\u2019\n\u2018Oh a sensible party sir.",
    "No nonsense about her.\u2019\n\u2018She didn\u2019t express any opinions on the death\u2019\nThe Inspector shook his head.",
    "\u2018I don\u2019t think she\u2019ll have anything more to tell us sir but we\u2019ll have to make sure.",
    "Then\nthere are the Americans.\u2019\nColonel Weston nodded.",
    "He said \u2018Let\u2019s have \u2019em all in and get it over as soon as possible.",
    "Never know might learn something.",
    "About the blackmailing stunt if about nothing else.\u2019\nIII\nMr and Mrs Gardener came into the presence of authority together.",
    "Mrs Gardener explained immediately.",
    "\u2018I hope you\u2019ll understand how it is Colonel Weston that is the name I think.\u2019 Reassured\non this point she went on \u2018But this has been a very bad shock to me and Mr Gardener is\nalways very very careful of my health\u2014\u2019\nMr Gardener here interpolated \u2018Mrs Gardener\u2019 he said \u2018is very sensitive.\u2019\n\u2018\u2014and he said to me \u201cWhy Carrie\u201d he said \u201cnaturally I\u2019m coming right along with you.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not that we haven\u2019t the highest admiration for British police methods because we\nhave.",
    "I\u2019ve been told that British police procedure is most refined and delicate and I\u2019ve\nnever doubted it and certainly when I once had a bracelet missing at the Savoy Hotel\nnothing could have been more lovely and sympathetic than the young man who came to\nsee me about it and of course I hadn\u2019t really lost the bracelet at all but just mislaid it\nthat\u2019s the worst of rushing about so much it makes you kind of forgetful where you put\nthings\u2014\u2019 Mrs Gardener paused inhaled gently and started off again.",
    "\u2018And what I say is\n91\n\n\fand I know Mr Gardener agrees with me that we\u2019re only too anxious to do anything to\nhelp the British police in every way.",
    "So go right ahead and ask me anything at all you want\nto know\u2014\u2019\nColonel Weston opened his mouth to comply with this invitation but had momentarily to\npostpone speech while Mrs Gardener went on.",
    "\u2018That\u2019s what I said Odell isn\u2019t it And that\u2019s so isn\u2019t it\u2019\n\u2018Yes darling\u2019 said Mr Gardener.",
    "Colonel Weston spoke hastily.",
    "\u2018I understand Mrs Gardener that you and your husband were on the beach all the\nmorning\u2019\nFor once Mr Gardener was able to get in first.",
    "\u2018That\u2019s so\u2019 he said.",
    "\u2018Why certainly we were\u2019 said Mrs Gardener.",
    "\u2018And a lovely peaceful morning it was just\nlike any other morning if you get me perhaps even more so and not the slightest idea in\nour minds of what was happening round the corner on that lonely beach.\u2019\n\u2018Did you see Mrs Marshall at all today\u2019\n\u2018We did not.",
    "And I said to Odell why wherever can Mrs Marshall have got to this morning\nI said.",
    "And first her husband coming looking for her and then that good\u2010looking young\nman Mr Redfern and so impatient he was just sitting there on the beach scowling at\neveryone and everything.",
    "And I said to myself why when he has that nice pretty little wife\nof his own must he go running after that dreadful woman Because that\u2019s just what I felt\nshe was.",
    "I always felt that about her didn\u2019t I Odell\u2019\n\u2018Yes darling.\u2019\n\u2018However that nice Captain Marshall came to marry such a woman I just cannot imagine\nand with that nice young daughter growing up and it\u2019s so important for girls to have the\nright influence.",
    "Mrs Marshall was not at all the right person\u2014no breeding at all\u2014and I\nshould say a very animal nature.",
    "Now if Captain Marshall had had any sense he\u2019d have\nmarried Miss Darnley who\u2019s a very very charming woman and a very distinguished one.",
    "I\nmust say I admire the way she\u2019s gone straight ahead and built up a first\u2010class business as\nshe has.",
    "It takes brains to do a thing like that\u2014and you\u2019ve only got to look at Rosamund\nDarnley to see she\u2019s just frantic with brains.",
    "She could plan and carry out any mortal thing\nshe liked.",
    "I just admire that woman more than I can say.",
    "And I said to Mr Gardener the\nother day that any one could see she was very much in love with Captain Marshall\u2014crazy\nabout him was what I said didn\u2019t I Odell\u2019\n\u2018Yes darling.\u2019\n92\n\n\f\u2018It seems they knew each other as children and why now who knows it may all come\nright after all with that woman out of the way.",
    "I\u2019m not a narrow\u2010minded woman Colonel\nWeston and it isn\u2019t that I disapprove of the stage as such\u2014why quite a lot of my best\nfriends are actresses\u2014but I\u2019ve said to Mr Gardener all along that there was something evil\nabout that woman.",
    "And you see I\u2019ve been proved right.\u2019\nShe paused triumphantly.",
    "The lips of Hercule Poirot quivered in a little smile.",
    "His eyes met for a minute the shrewd\ngrey eyes of Mr Gardener.",
    "Colonel Weston said rather desperately \u2018Well thank you Mrs Gardener.",
    "I suppose there\u2019s\nnothing that either of you has noticed since you\u2019ve been here that might have a bearing\nupon the case\u2019\n\u2018Why no I don\u2019t think so.\u2019 Mr Gardener spoke with a slow drawl.",
    "\u2018Mrs Marshall was\naround with young Redfern most of the time\u2014but everybody can tell you that.\u2019\n\u2018What about her husband Did he mind do you think\u2019\nMr Gardener said cautiously \u2018Captain Marshall is a very reserved man.\u2019\nMrs Gardener confirmed this by saying \u2018Why yes he is a real Britisher\u2019\nIV\nOn the slightly apoplectic countenance of Major Barry various emotions seemed\ncontending for mastery.",
    "He was endeavouring to look properly horrified but could not\nsubdue a kind of shamefaced gusto.",
    "He was saying in his hoarse slightly wheezy voice \u2018Glad to help you any way I can.",
    "\u2019Course\nI don\u2019t know anythin\u2019 about it\u2014nothin\u2019 at all.",
    "Not acquainted with the parties.",
    "But I\u2019ve\nknocked about a bit in my time.",
    "Lived a lot in the East you know.",
    "And I can tell you that\nafter being in an Indian hill station what you don\u2019t know about human nature isn\u2019t worth\nknowin\u2019.\u2019\nHe paused took a breath and was off again.",
    "\u2018Matter of fact this business reminds me of a case in Simla.",
    "Fellow called Robinson or was\nit Falconer Anyway he was in the East Wilts or was it the North Surreys Can\u2019t remember\nnow and anyway it doesn\u2019t matter.",
    "Quiet chap you know great reader\u2014mild as milk\nyou\u2019d have said.",
    "Went for his wife one evening in their bungalow.",
    "Got her by the throat.",
    "She\u2019d been carryin\u2019 on with some feller or other and he\u2019d got wise to it.",
    "By Jove he nearly\ndid for her It was touch and go.",
    "Surprised us all Didn\u2019t think he had it in him.\u2019\nHercule Poirot murmured \u2018And you see there an analogy to the death of Mrs Marshall\u2019\n\u2018Well what I mean to say\u2014strangled you know.",
    "Same idea.",
    "Feller suddenly sees red\u2019\n93\n\n\fPoirot said \u2018You think that Captain Marshall felt like that\u2019\n\u2018Oh look here I never said that.\u2019 Major Barry\u2019s face went even redder.",
    "\u2018Never said\nanything about Marshall.",
    "Thoroughly nice chap.",
    "Wouldn\u2019t say a word against him for the\nworld.\u2019\nPoirot murmured \u2018Ah pardon but you did refer to the natural reactions of a husband.\u2019\nMajor Barry said \u2018Well I mean to say I should think she\u2019d been pretty hot stuff.",
    "Eh Got\nyoung Redfern on a string all right.",
    "And there were probably others before him.",
    "But the\nfunny thing is you know that husbands are a dense lot.",
    "Amazin\u2019.",
    "I\u2019ve been surprised by it\nagain and again.",
    "They see a feller sweet on their wife but they don\u2019t see that she\u2019s sweet\non him Remember a case like that in Poona.",
    "Very pretty woman Jove she led her\nhusband a dance\u2014\u2019\nColonel Weston stirred a little restively.",
    "He said \u2018Yes yes Major Barry.",
    "For the moment\nwe\u2019ve just got to establish the facts.",
    "You don\u2019t know of anything personally\u2014that you\u2019ve\nseen or noticed that might help us in this case\u2019\n\u2018Well really Weston I can\u2019t say I do.",
    "Saw her and young Redfern one afternoon on Gull\nCove\u2019\u2014here he winked knowingly and gave a deep hoarse chuckle\u2014\u2018very pretty it was\ntoo.",
    "But it\u2019s not evidence of that kind you\u2019re wanting.",
    "Ha ha\u2019\n\u2018You did not see Mrs Marshall at all this morning\u2019\n\u2018Didn\u2019t see anybody this morning.",
    "Went over to St Loo.",
    "Just my luck.",
    "Sort of place here\nwhere nothin\u2019 happens for months and when it does you miss it\u2019\nThe Major\u2019s voice held a ghoulish regret.",
    "Colonel Weston prompted him.",
    "\u2018You went to St Loo you say\u2019\n\u2018Yes wanted to do some telephonin\u2019.",
    "No telephone here and that post\u2010office place at\nLeathercombe Bay isn\u2019t very private.\u2019\n\u2018Were your telephone calls of a very private nature\u2019\nThe Major winked again cheerfully.",
    "\u2018Well they were and they weren\u2019t.",
    "Wanted to get through to a pal of mine and get him to\nput somethin\u2019 on a horse.",
    "Couldn\u2019t get through to him worse luck.\u2019\n\u2018Where did you telephone from\u2019\n\n94\n\n\f\u2018Call box in the G.P.O.",
    "at St Loo.",
    "Then on the way back I got lost\u2014these confounded\nlanes\u2014twistin\u2019 and turnin\u2019 all over the place.",
    "Must have wasted an hour over that at least.",
    "Damned confusing part of the world.",
    "I only got back half an hour ago.\u2019\nColonel Weston said \u2018Speak to anyone or meet anyone in St Loo\u2019\nMajor Barry said with a chuckle \u2018Wantin\u2019 me to prove an alibi Can\u2019t think of anythin\u2019\nuseful.",
    "Saw about fifty thousand people in St Loo\u2014but that\u2019s not to say they\u2019ll remember\nseein\u2019 me.\u2019\nThe Chief Constable said \u2018We have to ask these things you know.\u2019\n\u2018Right you are.",
    "Call on me at any time.",
    "Glad to help you.",
    "Very fetchin\u2019 woman the\ndeceased.",
    "Like to help you catch the feller who did it.",
    "The Lonely Beach Murder\u2014bet you\nthat\u2019s what the papers will call it.",
    "Reminds me of the time\u2014\u2019\nIt was Inspector Colgate who firmly nipped this latest reminiscence in the bud and\nmanoeuvred the garrulous Major out of the door.",
    "Coming back he said \u2018Difficult to check up on anything in St Loo.",
    "It\u2019s the middle of the\nholiday season.\u2019\nThe Chief Constable said \u2018Yes we can\u2019t take him off the list.",
    "Not that I seriously believe\nhe\u2019s implicated.",
    "Dozens of old bores like him going about.",
    "Remember one or two of them\nin my army days.",
    "Still\u2014he\u2019s a possibility.",
    "I leave all that to you Colgate.",
    "Check what time\nhe took the car out\u2014petrol\u2014all that.",
    "It\u2019s humanly possible that he parked the car\nsomewhere in a lonely spot walked back here and went to the cove.",
    "But it doesn\u2019t seem\nfeasible to me.",
    "He\u2019d have run too much risk of being seen.\u2019\nColgate nodded.",
    "He said \u2018Of course there are a good many charabancs here today.",
    "Fine day.",
    "They start\narriving round about half\u2010past eleven.",
    "High tide was at seven.",
    "Low tide would be about\none o\u2019clock.",
    "People would be spread out over the sands and the causeway.\u2019\nWeston said \u2018Yes.",
    "But he\u2019d have to come up from the causeway past the hotel.\u2019\n\u2018Not right past it.",
    "He could branch off on the path that leads up over the top of the island.\u2019\nWeston said doubtfully \u2018I\u2019m not saying that he mightn\u2019t have done it without being seen.",
    "Practically all the hotel guests were on the bathing beach except for Mrs Redfern and the\nMarshall girl who were down in Gull Cove and the beginning of that path would only be\noverlooked by a few rooms of the hotel and there are plenty of chances against anyone\nlooking out of those windows just at that moment.",
    "For the matter of that I dare say it\u2019s\npossible for a man to walk up to the hotel through the lounge and out again without\nanyone happening to see him.",
    "But what I say is he couldn\u2019t count on no one seeing him.\u2019\nColgate said \u2018He could have gone round to the cove by boat.\u2019\n95\n\n\fWeston nodded.",
    "He said \u2018That\u2019s much sounder.",
    "If he\u2019d had a boat handy in one of the\ncoves nearby he could have left the car rowed or sailed to Pixy Cove done the murder\nrowed back picked up the car and arrived back with this tale about having been to St Loo\nand lost his way\u2014a story that he\u2019d know would be pretty hard to disprove.\u2019\n\u2018You\u2019re right sir.\u2019\nThe Chief Constable said \u2018Well I leave it to you Colgate.",
    "Comb the neighbourhood\nthoroughly.",
    "You know what to do.",
    "We\u2019d better see Miss Brewster now.\u2019\nV\nEmily Brewster was not able to add anything of material value to what they already knew.",
    "Weston said after she had repeated her story \u2018And there\u2019s nothing you know of that could\nhelp us in any way\u2019\nEmily Brewster said shortly \u2018Afraid not.",
    "It\u2019s a distressing business.",
    "However I expect you\u2019ll\nsoon get to the bottom of it.\u2019\nWeston said \u2018I hope so I\u2019m sure.\u2019\nEmily Brewster said dryly \u2018Ought not to be difficult.\u2019\n\u2018Now what do you mean by that Miss Brewster\u2019\n\u2018Sorry.",
    "Wasn\u2019t attempting to teach you your business.",
    "All I meant was that with a woman\nof that kind it ought to be easy enough.\u2019\nHercule Poirot murmured \u2018That is your opinion\u2019\nEmily Brewster snapped out \u2018Of course.",
    "De mortuis nil nisi bonum and all that but you\ncan\u2019t get away from facts.",
    "That woman was a bad lot through and through.",
    "You\u2019ve only got\nto hunt round a bit in her unsavoury past.\u2019\nHercule Poirot said gently \u2018You did not like her\u2019\n\u2018I know a bit too much about her.\u2019 In answer to the inquiring looks she went on \u2018My first\ncousin married one of the Erskines.",
    "You\u2019ve probably heard that that woman induced old\nSir Robert when he was in his dotage to leave most of his fortune to her away from his\nown family.\u2019\nColonel Weston said \u2018And the family\u2014er\u2014resented that\u2019\n\u2018Naturally.",
    "His association with her was a scandal anyway and on top of that to leave her\na sum like fifty thousand pounds shows just the kind of woman she was.",
    "I dare say I sound\nhard but in my opinion the Arlena Stuarts of this world deserve very little sympathy.",
    "I\nknow of something else too\u2014a young fellow who lost his head about her completely\u2014\n96\n\n\fhe\u2019d always been a bit wild naturally his association with her pushed him over the edge.",
    "He did something rather fishy with some shares\u2014solely to get money to spend on her\u2014\nand only just managed to escape prosecution.",
    "That woman contaminated everyone she\nmet.",
    "Look at the way she was ruining young Redfern.",
    "No I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t have any regret\nfor her death\u2014though of course it would have been better if she\u2019d drowned herself or\nfallen over a cliff.",
    "Strangling is rather unpleasant.\u2019\n\u2018And you think the murderer was someone out of her past\u2019\n\u2018Yes I do.\u2019\n\u2018Someone who came from the mainland with no one seeing him\u2019\n\u2018Why should any one see him We were all on the beach.",
    "I gather the Marshall child and\nChristine Redfern were down on Gull Cove out of the way.",
    "Captain Marshall was in his\nroom in the hotel.",
    "Then who on earth was there to see him except possibly Miss Darnley.\u2019\n\u2018Where was Miss Darnley\u2019\n\u2018Sitting up on the cutting at the top of the cliff.",
    "Sunny Ledge it\u2019s called.",
    "We saw her there\nMr Redfern and I when we were rowing round the island.\u2019\nColonel Weston said \u2018You may be right Miss Brewster.\u2019\nEmily Brewster said positively \u2018I\u2019m sure I\u2019m right.",
    "When a woman\u2019s neither more nor less\nthan a nasty mess then she herself will provide the best possible clue.",
    "Don\u2019t you agree\nwith me M. Poirot\u2019\nHercule Poirot looked up.",
    "His eyes met her confident grey ones.",
    "He said \u2018Oh yes\u2014I agree\nwith that which you have just this minute said.",
    "Arlena Marshall herself is the best the only\nclue to her own death.\u2019\nMiss Brewster said sharply \u2018Well then\u2019\nShe stood there an erect sturdy figure her cool self\u2010confident glance going from one man\nto the other.",
    "Colonel Weston said \u2018You may be sure Miss Brewster that any clue there may be in Mrs\nMarshall\u2019s past life will not be overlooked.\u2019\nEmily Brewster went out.",
    "VI\nInspector Colgate shifted his position at the table.",
    "He said in a thoughtful voice \u2018She\u2019s a\ndetermined one she is.",
    "And she\u2019d got her knife into the dead lady proper she had.\u2019\n\n97\n\n\fHe stopped a minute and said reflectively \u2018It\u2019s a pity in a way that she\u2019s got a cast\u2010iron\nalibi for the whole morning.",
    "Did you notice her hands sir As big as a man\u2019s.",
    "And she\u2019s a\nhefty woman\u2014as strong and stronger than many a man I\u2019d say...\u2019\nHe paused again.",
    "His glance at Poirot was almost pleading.",
    "\u2018And you say she never left the beach this morning M. Poirot\u2019\nSlowly Poirot shook his head.",
    "He said \u2018My dear Inspector she came down to the beach\nbefore Mrs Marshall could have reached Pixy Cove and she was within my sight until she\nset off with Mr Redfern in the boat.\u2019\nInspector Colgate said gloomily \u2018Then that washes her out.\u2019\nHe seemed upset about it.",
    "VII\nAs always Hercule Poirot felt a keen sense of pleasure at the sight of Rosamund Darnley.",
    "Even to a bare police inquiry into the ugly facts of murder she brought a distinction of her\nown.",
    "She sat down opposite Colonel Weston and turned a grave and intelligent face to him.",
    "She said \u2018You want my name and address Rosamund Anne Darnley.",
    "I carry on a\ndressmaking business under the name of Rose Mond Ltd at 622 Brook Street.\u2019\n\u2018Thank you Miss Darnley.",
    "Now can you tell us anything that may help us\u2019\n\u2018I don\u2019t really think I can.\u2019\n\u2018Your own movements\u2014\u2019\n\u2018I had breakfast about nine\u2010thirty.",
    "Then I went up to my room and collected some books\nand my sunshade and went out to Sunny Ledge.",
    "That must have been about twenty\u2010five\npast ten.",
    "I came back to the hotel about ten minutes to twelve went up and got my tennis\nracquet and went out to the tennis courts where I played tennis until lunch\u2010time.\u2019\n\u2018You were in the cliff recess called by the hotel Sunny Ledge from about half\u2010past ten\nuntil ten minutes to twelve\u2019\n\u2018Yes.\u2019\n\u2018Did you see Mrs Marshall at all this morning\u2019\n\u2018No.\u2019\n98\n\n\f\u2018Did you see her from the cliff as she paddled her float round to Pixy Cove\u2019\n\u2018No she must have gone by before I got there.\u2019\n\u2018Did you notice anyone on a float or in a boat at all this morning\u2019\n\u2018No I don\u2019t think I did.",
    "You see I was reading.",
    "Of course I looked up from my book from\ntime to time but as it happened the sea was quite bare each time I did so.\u2019\n\u2018You didn\u2019t even notice Mr Redfern and Miss Brewster when they went round\u2019\n\u2018No.\u2019\n\u2018You were I think acquainted with Mr Marshall\u2019\n\u2018Captain Marshall is an old family friend.",
    "His family and mine lived next door to each other.",
    "I had not seen him however for a good many years\u2014it must be something like twelve\nyears.\u2019\n\u2018And Mrs Marshall\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019d never exchanged half a dozen words with her until I met her here.\u2019\n\u2018Were Captain and Mrs Marshall as far as you knew on good terms with each other\u2019\n\u2018On perfectly good terms I should say.\u2019\n\u2018Was Captain Marshall very devoted to his wife\u2019\nRosamund said \u2018He may have been.",
    "I can\u2019t really tell you anything about that.",
    "Captain\nMarshall is rather old\u2010fashioned\u2014he hasn\u2019t got the modern habit of shouting matrimonial\nwoes upon the housetop.\u2019\n\u2018Did you like Mrs Marshall Miss Darnley\u2019\n\u2018No.\u2019\nThe monosyllable came quietly and evenly.",
    "It sounded what it was\u2014a simple statement of\nfact.",
    "\u2018Why was that\u2019\nA half smile came to Rosamund\u2019s lips.",
    "She said \u2018Surely you\u2019ve discovered that Arlena\nMarshall was not popular with her own sex She was bored to death with women and\nshowed it.",
    "Nevertheless I should like to have had the dressing of her.",
    "She had a great gift\nfor clothes.",
    "Her clothes were always just right and she wore them well.",
    "I should like to\nhave had her as a client.\u2019\n99\n\n\f\u2018She spent a good deal on clothes\u2019\n\u2018She must have done.",
    "But then she had money of her own and of course Captain Marshall\nis quite well off.\u2019\n\u2018Did you ever hear or did it ever occur to you that Mrs Marshall was being blackmailed\nMiss Darnley\u2019\nA look of intense astonishment came over Rosamund Darnley\u2019s expressive face.",
    "She said \u2018Blackmailed Arlena\u2019\n\u2018The idea seems to surprise you.\u2019\n\u2018Well yes it does rather.",
    "It seems so incongruous.\u2019\n\u2018But surely it is possible\u2019\n\u2018Everything\u2019s possible isn\u2019t it The world soon teaches one that.",
    "But I wondered what any\none could blackmail Arlena about\u2019\n\u2018There are certain things I suppose that Mrs Marshall might be anxious should not come\nto her husband\u2019s ears\u2019\n\u2018We\u2010ll yes.\u2019\nShe explained the doubt in her voice by saying with a half smile \u2018I sound sceptical but\nthen you see Arlena was rather notorious in her conduct.",
    "She never made much of a\npose of respectability.\u2019\n\u2018You think then that her husband was aware of her\u2014intimacies with other people\u2019\nThere was a pause.",
    "Rosamund was frowning.",
    "She spoke at last in a slow reluctant voice.",
    "She said \u2018You know I don\u2019t really know what to think.",
    "I\u2019ve always assumed that Kenneth\nMarshall accepted his wife quite frankly for what she was.",
    "That he had no illusions about\nher.",
    "But it may not be so.\u2019\n\u2018He may have believed in her absolutely\u2019\nRosamund said with semi\u2010exasperation \u2018Men are such fools.",
    "And Kenneth Marshall is\nunworldly under his sophisticated manner.",
    "He may have believed in her blindly.",
    "He may\nhave thought she was just\u2014admired.\u2019\n\u2018And you know of no one\u2014that is you have heard of no one who was likely to have had a\ngrudge against Mrs Marshall\u2019\nRosamund Darnley smiled.",
    "She said \u2018Only resentful wives.",
    "And I presume since she was\nstrangled that it was a man who killed her.\u2019\n100\n\n\f\u2018Yes.\u2019\nRosamund said thoughtfully \u2018No I can\u2019t think of any one.",
    "But then I probably shouldn\u2019t\nknow.",
    "You\u2019ll have to ask someone in her own intimate set.\u2019\n\u2018Thank you Miss Darnley.\u2019\nRosamund turned a little in her chair.",
    "She said \u2018Hasn\u2019t M. Poirot any questions to ask\u2019\nHer faintly ironic smile flashed out at him.",
    "Hercule Poirot smiled and shook his head.",
    "He said \u2018I can think of nothing.\u2019\nRosamund Darnley got up and went out.",
    "101\n\n\f102\n\n\fChapter 8\nThey were standing in the bedroom that had been Arlena Marshall\u2019s.",
    "Two big bay windows gave on to a balcony that overlooked the bathing beach and the sea\nbeyond.",
    "Sunshine poured into the room flashing over the bewildering array of bottles and\njars on Arlena\u2019s dressing\u2010table.",
    "Here there was every kind of cosmetic and unguent known to beauty parlours.",
    "Amongst\nthis panoply of woman\u2019s affairs three men moved purposefully.",
    "Inspector Colgate went\nabout shutting and opening drawers.",
    "Presently he gave a grunt.",
    "He had come upon a packet of folded letters.",
    "He and Weston\nran through them together.",
    "Hercule Poirot had moved to the wardrobe.",
    "He opened the door of the hanging cupboard\nand looked at the multiplicity of gowns and sports suits that hung there.",
    "He opened the\nother side.",
    "Foamy lingerie lay in piles.",
    "On a wide shelf were hats.",
    "Two more beach\ncardboard hats in lacquer red and pale yellow\u2014a Big Hawaiian straw hat\u2014another of\ndrooping dark\u2010blue linen and three or four little absurdities for which no doubt several\nguiness had been paid apiece\u2014a kind of beret in dark blue\u2014a tuft no more of black\nvelvet\u2014a pale grey turban.",
    "Hercule Poirot stood scanning them\u2014a faintly indulgent smile came to his lips.",
    "He\nmurmured \u2018Les femmes\u2019\nColonel Weston was refolding the letters.",
    "\u2018Three from young Redfern\u2019 he said.",
    "\u2018Damned young ass.",
    "He\u2019ll learn not to write letters to\nwomen in a few more years.",
    "Women always keep letters and then swear they\u2019ve burnt\nthem.",
    "There\u2019s one other letter here.",
    "Same line of country.\u2019\nHe held it out and Poirot took it.",
    "Darling Arlena \u2014God I feel blue.",
    "To be going out to China\u2014and perhaps not\nseeing you again for years and years.",
    "I didn\u2019t know any man could go on feeling\ncrazy about a woman like I feel about you.",
    "Thanks for the cheque.",
    "They won\u2019t\nprosecute now.",
    "It was a near shave though and all because I wanted to make big\nmoney for you.",
    "Can you forgive me I wanted to set diamonds in your ears\u2014your\nlovely ears\u2014and clasp great milk\u2010white pearls round your throat only they say\npearls are no good nowadays.",
    "A fabulous emerald then Yes that\u2019s the thing.",
    "A\ngreat emerald cool and green and full of hidden fire.",
    "Don\u2019t forget me\u2014but you\nwon\u2019t I know.",
    "You\u2019re mine\u2014always.",
    "Goodbye\u2014goodbye\u2014goodbye.",
    "J.N.",
    "103\n\n\fInspector Colgate said \u2018Might be worth while to find out if J.N.",
    "really did go to China.",
    "Otherwise\u2014well he might be the person we\u2019re looking for.",
    "Crazy about the woman\nidealizing her suddenly finding out he\u2019d been played for a sucker.",
    "It sounds to me as\nthough this is the boy Miss Brewster mentioned.",
    "Yes I think this might be useful.\u2019\nHercule Poirot nodded.",
    "He said \u2018Yes that letter is important.",
    "I find it very important.\u2019\nHe turned round and stared at the room\u2014at the bottles on the dressing\u2010table\u2014at the\nopen wardrobe and at a big Pierrot doll that lolled insolently on the bed.",
    "They went into Kenneth Marshall\u2019s room.",
    "It was next door to his wife\u2019s but with no communicating door and no balcony.",
    "It faced the\nsame way and had two windows but it was much smaller.",
    "Between the two windows a\ngilt mirror hung on the wall.",
    "In the corner beyond the right\u2010hand window was the\ndressing\u2010table.",
    "On it were two ivory brushes a clothes brush and a bottle of hair lotion.",
    "In\nthe corner by the left\u2010hand window was a writing\u2010table.",
    "An open typewriter stood on it\nand papers were ranged in a stack beside it.",
    "Colgate went through them rapidly.",
    "He said \u2018All seems straightforward enough.",
    "Ah here\u2019s the letter he mentioned this\nmorning.",
    "Dated the 24th\u2014that\u2019s yesterday.",
    "And here\u2019s the envelope postmarked\nLeathercombe Bay this morning.",
    "Seems all square.",
    "Now we\u2019ll have an idea if he could have\nprepared that answer of his beforehand.\u2019\nHe sat down.",
    "Colonel Weston said \u2018We\u2019ll leave you to it for a moment.",
    "We\u2019ll just glance through the\nrest of the rooms.",
    "Everyone\u2019s been kept out of this corridor until now and they\u2019re getting\na bit restive about it.\u2019\nThey went next into Linda Marshall\u2019s room.",
    "It faced east looking out over the rocks down\nto the sea below.",
    "Weston gave a glance round.",
    "He murmured \u2018Don\u2019t suppose there\u2019s anything to see here.",
    "But it\u2019s possible Marshall might have put something in his daughter\u2019s room that he didn\u2019t\nwant us to find.",
    "Not likely though.",
    "It isn\u2019t as though there had been a weapon or anything\nto get rid of.\u2019\nHe went out again.",
    "Hercule Poirot stayed behind.",
    "He found something that interested him in the grate.",
    "Something had been burnt there recently.",
    "He knelt down working patiently.",
    "He laid out\nhis finds on a sheet of paper.",
    "A large irregular blob of candle grease\u2014some fragments of\ngreen paper or cardboard possibly a pull\u2010off calendar for with it was an unburnt fragment\nbearing a large figure 5 and a scrap of printing... noble deeds...",
    "There was also an ordinary\npin and some burnt animal matter which might have been hair.",
    "104\n\n\fPoirot arranged them neatly in a row and stared at them.",
    "He murmured \u2018Do noble deeds not dream them all day long.",
    "C\u2019est possible.",
    "But what is\none to make of this collection C\u2019est fantastique \u2019\nAnd then he picked up the pin and his eyes grew sharp and green.",
    "He murmured \u2018Pour l\u2019amour de Dieu Is it possible\u2019\nHercule Poirot got up from where he had been kneeling by the grate.",
    "Slowly he looked round the room and this time there was an entirely new expression on\nhis face.",
    "It was grave and almost stern.",
    "To the left of the mantelpiece there were some shelves with a row of books.",
    "Hercule\nPoirot looked thoughtfully along the titles.",
    "A Bible a battered copy of Shakespeare\u2019s plays The Marriage of William Ashe by Mrs\nHumphry Ward.",
    "The Young Stepmother by Charlotte Yonge.",

    "The Burning Court by Dickson Carr.",
    "Poirot took out two books.",
    "The Young Stepmother and William Ashe and glanced inside at\nthe blurred stamp affixed to the title page.",
    "As he was about to replace them his eye\ncaught sight of a book that had been shoved behind the other books.",
    "It was a small dumpy\nvolume bound in brown calf.",
    "He took it out and opened it.",
    "Very slowly he nodded his head.",
    "He murmured \u2018So I was right...",
    "Yes I was right.",
    "But for the other\u2014is that possible too\nNo it is not possible unless...\u2019\nHe stayed there motionless stroking his moustaches whilst his mind ranged busily over\nthe problem.",
    "He said again softly \u2018Unless\u2014\u2019\nII\nColonel Weston looked in at the door.",
    "\u2018Hullo Poirot still there\u2019\n\u2018I arrive.",
    "I arrive\u2019 cried Poirot.",
    "He hurried out into the corridor.",
    "The room next to Linda\u2019s was that of the Redferns.",
    "105\n\n\fPoirot looked into it noting automatically the trace of two different individualities\u2014a\nneatness and tidiness which he associated with Christine and a picturesque disorder\nwhich was characteristic of Patrick.",
    "Apart from these sidelights on personality the room\ndid not interest him.",
    "Next to it again was Rosamund Darnley\u2019s room and here he lingered for a moment in the\nsheer pleasure of the owner\u2019s personality.",
    "He noted the few books that lay on the table next to the bed the expensive simplicity of\nthe toilet set on the dressing\u2010table.",
    "And there came gently to his nostrils the elusive\nexpensive perfume that Rosamund Darnley used.",
    "Next to Rosamund Darnley\u2019s room at the northern end of the corridor was an open\nwindow leading to a balcony from which an outside stair led down to the rocks below.",
    "Weston said \u2018That\u2019s the way people go down to bathe before breakfast\u2014that is if they\nbathe off the rocks as most of them do.\u2019\nInterest came into Hercule Poirot\u2019s eyes.",
    "He stepped outside and looked down.",
    "Below a path led to steps cut zigzag leading down the rocks to the sea.",
    "There was also a\npath that led round the hotel to the left.",
    "He said \u2018One could go down these stairs go to\nthe left round the hotel and join the main path up from the causeway.\u2019\nWeston nodded.",
    "He amplified Poirot\u2019s statement.",
    "\u2018One could go right across the island without going through the hotel at all.\u2019 He added\n\u2018But one might still be seen from a window.\u2019\n\u2018What window\u2019\n\u2018Two of the public bathrooms look out that way\u2014north\u2014and the staff bathroom and the\ncloakrooms on the ground floor.",
    "Also the billiard room.\u2019\nPoirot nodded.",
    "He said \u2018And all the former have frosted glass windows and one does not\nplay billiards on a fine morning.\u2019\n\u2018Exactly.\u2019\nWeston paused and said \u2018If he did it that\u2019s the way he went.\u2019\n\u2018You mean Captain Marshall\u2019\n\u2018Yes.",
    "Blackmail or no blackmail.",
    "I still feel it points to him.",
    "And his manner\u2014well his\nmanner is unfortunate.\u2019\nHercule Poirot said dryly \u2018Perhaps\u2014but a manner does not make a murderer\u2019\n106\n\n\fWeston said \u2018Then you think he\u2019s out of it\u2019\nPoirot shook his head.",
    "He said \u2018No I would not say that.\u2019\nWeston said \u2018We\u2019ll see what Colgate can make out of the typewriting alibi.",
    "In the\nmeantime I\u2019ve got the chambermaid of this floor waiting to be interviewed.",
    "A good deal\nmay depend on her evidence.\u2019\nThe chambermaid was a woman of thirty brisk efficient and intelligent.",
    "Her answers\ncame readily.",
    "Captain Marshall had come up to his room not long after ten\u2010thirty.",
    "She was then finishing\nthe room.",
    "He had asked her to be as quick as possible.",
    "She had not seen him come back\nbut she had heard the sound of the typewriter a little later.",
    "She put it at about five\nminutes to eleven.",
    "She was then in Mr and Mrs Redfern\u2019s room.",
    "After she had done that\nshe moved on to Miss Darnley\u2019s room at the end of the corridor.",
    "She could not hear the\ntypewriter from there.",
    "She went to Miss Darnley\u2019s room as near as she could say at just\nafter eleven o\u2019clock.",
    "She remembered hearing Leathercombe Church strike the hour as\nshe went in.",
    "At a quarter\u2010past eleven she had gone downstairs for her eleven o\u2019clock cup\nof tea and \u2018snack\u2019.",
    "Afterwards she had gone to do the rooms in the other wing of the\nhotel.",
    "In answer to the Chief Constable\u2019s question she explained that she had done the\nrooms in this corridor in the following order\nMiss Linda Marshall\u2019s the two public bathrooms Mrs Marshall\u2019s room and private bath\nCaptain Marshall\u2019s room.",
    "Mr and Mrs Redfern\u2019s room and private bath Miss Darnley\u2019s\nroom and private bath.",
    "Captain Marshall\u2019s and Miss Marshall\u2019s rooms had no adjoining\nbathrooms.",
    "During the time she was in Miss Darnley\u2019s room and bathroom she had not heard any one\npass the door or go out by the staircase to the rocks but it was quite likely she wouldn\u2019t\nhave heard if any one went quietly.",
    "Weston then directed his questions to the subject of Mrs Marshall.",
    "No Mrs Marshall wasn\u2019t one for rising early as a rule.",
    "She Gladys Narracott had been\nsurprised to find the door open and Mrs Marshall gone down at just after ten.",
    "Something\nquite unusual that was.",
    "\u2018Did Mrs Marshall always have her breakfast in bed\u2019\n\u2018Oh yes sir always.",
    "Not very much of it either.",
    "Just tea and orange juice and one piece of\ntoast.",
    "Slimming like so many ladies.\u2019\nNo she hadn\u2019t noticed anything unusual in Mrs Marshall\u2019s manner that morning.",
    "She\u2019d\nseemed quite as usual.",
    "Hercule Poirot murmured \u2018What did you think of Mrs Marshall Mademoiselle\u2019\n107\n\n\fGladys Narracott stared at him.",
    "She said \u2018Well that\u2019s hardly for me to say is it sir\u2019\n\u2018But yes it is for you to say.",
    "We are anxious\u2014very anxious\u2014to hear your impression.\u2019\nGladys gave a slightly uneasy glance towards the Chief Constable who endeavoured to\nmake his face sympathetic and approving though actually he felt slightly embarrassed by\nhis foreign colleague\u2019s methods of approach.",
    "He said \u2018Er\u2014yes certainly.",
    "Go ahead.\u2019\nFor the first time Gladys Narracott\u2019s brisk efficiency deserted her.",
    "Her fingers fumbled\nwith her print dress.",
    "She said \u2018Well Mrs Marshall\u2014she wasn\u2019t exactly a lady as you might\nsay.",
    "What I mean is she was more like an actress.\u2019\nColonel Weston said \u2018She was an actress.\u2019\n\u2018Yes sir that\u2019s what I\u2019m saying.",
    "She just went on exactly as she felt like it.",
    "She didn\u2019t\u2014\nwell she didn\u2019t trouble to be polite if she wasn\u2019t feeling polite.",
    "And she\u2019d be all smiles one\nminute and then if she couldn\u2019t find something or the bell wasn\u2019t answered at once or her\nlaundry wasn\u2019t back well be downright rude and nasty about it.",
    "None of us you might say\nliked her.",
    "But her clothes were beautiful and of course she was a very handsome lady so\nit was only natural she should be admired.\u2019\nColonel Weston said \u2018I am sorry to have to ask you what I am going to ask you but it is a\nvery vital matter.",
    "Can you tell me how things were between her and her husband\u2019\nGladys Narracott hesitated a minute.",
    "She said \u2018You don\u2019t\u2014it wasn\u2019t\u2014you don\u2019t think as he did it\u2019\nHercule Poirot said quickly \u2018Do you\u2019\n\u2018Oh I wouldn\u2019t like to think so.",
    "He\u2019s such a nice gentleman Captain Marshall.",
    "He couldn\u2019t\ndo a thing like that\u2014I\u2019m sure he couldn\u2019t.\u2019\n\u2018But you are not very sure\u2014I hear it in your voice.\u2019\nGladys Narracott said reluctantly \u2018You do read such things in the papers When there\u2019s\njealousy.",
    "If there\u2019s been goings on\u2014and of course everyone\u2019s been talking about it\u2014\nabout her and Mr Redfern I mean.",
    "And Mrs Redfern such a nice quiet lady It does seem a\nshame And Mr Redfern\u2019s a nice gentleman too but it seems men can\u2019t help themselves\nwhen it\u2019s a lady like Mrs Marshall\u2014one who\u2019s used to having her own way.",
    "Wives have to\nput up with a lot I\u2019m sure.\u2019 She sighed and paused.",
    "\u2018But if Captain Marshall found out\nabout it\u2014\u2019\nColonel Weston said sharply \u2018Well\u2019\nGladys Narracott said slowly \u2018I did think sometimes that Mrs Marshall was frightened of\nher husband knowing.\u2019\n108\n\n\f\u2018What makes you say that\u2019\n\u2018It wasn\u2019t anything definite sir.",
    "It was only I felt\u2014that sometimes she was\u2014afraid of him.",
    "He was a very quiet gentleman but he wasn\u2019t\u2014he wasn\u2019t easy.\u2019\nWeston said \u2018But you\u2019ve nothing definite to go on Nothing either of them ever said to\neach other.\u2019\nSlowly Gladys Narracott shook her head.",
    "Weston sighed.",
    "He went on.",
    "\u2018Now as to letters received by Mrs Marshall this morning.",
    "Can you tell us anything about\nthose\u2019\n\u2018There were about six or seven sir.",
    "I couldn\u2019t say exactly.\u2019\n\u2018Did you take them up to her\u2019\n\u2018Yes sir.",
    "I got them from the office as usual and put them on her breakfast tray.\u2019\n\u2018Do you remember anything about the look of them\u2019\nThe girl shook her head.",
    "\u2018They were just ordinary\u2010looking letters.",
    "Some of them were bills and circulars I think\nbecause they were torn up on the tray.\u2019\n\u2018What happened to them\u2019\n\u2018They went into the dustbin sir.",
    "One of the police gentlemen is going through that now.\u2019\nWeston nodded.",
    "\u2018And the contents of the waste\u2010paper baskets where are they\u2019\n\u2018They\u2019ll be in the dustbin too.\u2019\nWeston said \u2018H\u2019m\u2014well I think that is all at present.\u2019 He looked inquiringly at Poirot.",
    "Poirot leaned forward.",
    "\u2018When you did Miss Linda Marshall\u2019s room this morning did you do the fireplace\u2019\n\u2018There wasn\u2019t anything to do sir.",
    "There had been no fire lit.\u2019\n\u2018And there was nothing in the fireplace itself\u2019\n109\n\n\f\u2018No sir it was perfectly all right.\u2019\n\u2018What time did you do her room\u2019\n\u2018About a quarter\u2010past nine sir when she\u2019d gone down to breakfast.\u2019\n\u2018Did she come up to her room after breakfast do you know\u2019\n\u2018Yes sir.",
    "She came up about a quarter to ten.\u2019\n\u2018Did she stay in her room\u2019\n\u2018I think so sir.",
    "She came out hurrying rather just before half\u2010past ten.\u2019\n\u2018You didn\u2019t go into her room again\u2019\n\u2018No sir.",
    "I had finished with it.\u2019\nPoirot nodded.",
    "He said \u2018There is another thing I want to know.",
    "What people bathed\nbefore breakfast this morning\u2019\n\u2018I couldn\u2019t say about the other wing and the floor above.",
    "Only about this one.\u2019\n\u2018That is all I want to know.\u2019\n\u2018Well sir Captain Marshall and Mr Redfern were the only ones this morning I think.",
    "They\nalways go down for an early dip.\u2019\n\u2018Did you see them\u2019\n\u2018No sir but their wet bathing things were hanging over the balcony rail as usual.\u2019\n\u2018Miss Linda Marshall did not bathe this morning\u2019\n\u2018No sir.",
    "All her bathing dresses were quite dry.\u2019\n\u2018Ah\u2019 said Poirot.",
    "\u2018That is what I wanted to know.\u2019\nGladys Narracott volunteered \u2018She does most mornings sir.\u2019\n\u2018And the other three Miss Darnley Mrs Redfern and Mrs Marshall\u2019\n\u2018Mrs Marshall never sir.",
    "Miss Darnley has once or twice I think.",
    "Mrs Redfern doesn\u2019t\noften bathe before breakfast\u2014only when it\u2019s very hot but she didn\u2019t this morning.\u2019\nAgain Poirot nodded.",
    "Then he asked \u2018I wonder if you have noticed whether a bottle is\nmissing from any of the rooms you look after in this wing\u2019\n110\n\n\f\u2018A bottle sir What kind of a bottle\u2019\n\u2018Unfortunately I do not know.",
    "But have you noticed\u2014or would you be likely to notice\u2014if\none had gone\u2019\nGladys said frankly \u2018I shouldn\u2019t from Mrs Marshall\u2019s room sir and that\u2019s a fact.",
    "She has\never so many.\u2019\n\u2018And the other rooms\u2019\n\u2018Well I\u2019m not sure about Miss Darnley.",
    "She has a good many creams and lotions.",
    "But from\nthe other rooms yes I would sir.",
    "I mean if I were to look special.",
    "If I were noticing so to\nspeak.\u2019\n\u2018But you haven\u2019t actually noticed\u2019\n\u2018No because I wasn\u2019t looking special as I say.\u2019\n\u2018Perhaps you would go and look now then.\u2019\n\u2018Certainly sir.\u2019\nShe left the room her print dress rustling.",
    "Weston looked at Poirot.",
    "He said \u2018What\u2019s all\nthis\u2019\nPoirot murmured \u2018My orderly mind that is vexed by trifles Miss Brewster this morning\nwas bathing off the rocks before breakfast and she says that a bottle was thrown from\nabove and nearly hit her.",
    "Eh bien I want to know who threw that bottle and why\u2019\n\u2018My dear man any one may have chucked a bottle away.\u2019\n\u2018Not at all.",
    "To begin with it could only have been thrown from a window on the east side\nof the hotel\u2014that is one of the windows of the rooms we have just examined.",
    "Now I ask\nyou if you have an empty bottle on your dressing\u2010table or in your bathroom what do you\ndo with it I will tell you you drop it into the waste\u2010paper basket.",
    "You do not take the\ntrouble to go out on your balcony and hurl it into the sea For one thing you might hit\nsomeone for another it would be too much trouble.",
    "No you would only do that if you did\nnot want any one to see that particular bottle.\u2019\nWeston stared at him.",
    "Weston said \u2018I know that Chief Inspector Japp whom I met over a case not long ago\nalways says you have a damned tortuous mind.",
    "You\u2019re not going to tell me now that\nArlena Marshall wasn\u2019t strangled at all but poisoned out of some mysterious bottle with a\nmysterious drug\u2019\n\u2018No no I do not think there was poison in that bottle.\u2019\n111\n\n\f\u2018Then what was there\u2019\n\u2018I do not know at all.",
    "That\u2019s why I am interested.\u2019\nGladys Narracott came back.",
    "She was a little breathless.",
    "She said \u2018I\u2019m sorry sir but I can\u2019t\nfind anything missing.",
    "I\u2019m sure there\u2019s nothing gone from Captain Marshall\u2019s room or Miss\nLinda Marshall\u2019s room or Mr and Mrs Redfern\u2019s room and I\u2019m pretty sure there\u2019s nothing\ngone from Miss Darnley\u2019s either.",
    "But I couldn\u2019t say about Mrs Marshall\u2019s.",
    "As I say she\u2019s got\nsuch a lot.\u2019\nPoirot shrugged his shoulders.",
    "He said \u2018No matter.",
    "We will leave it.\u2019\nGladys Narracott said \u2018Is there anything more sir\u2019\nShe looked from one to the other of them.",
    "Weston said \u2018Don\u2019t think so.",
    "Thank you.\u2019\nPoirot said \u2018I thank you no.",
    "You are sure are you not that there is nothing\u2014nothing at\nall that you have forgotten to tell us\u2019\n\u2018About Mrs Marshall sir\u2019\n\u2018About anything at all.",
    "Anything unusual out of the way unexplained slightly peculiar\nrather curious\u2014enfin something that has made you say to yourself or to one of your\ncolleagues \u201cThat\u2019s funny\u201d\u2019\nGladys said doubtfully \u2018Well not the sort of thing that you would mean sir.\u2019\nHercule Poirot said \u2018Never mind what I mean.",
    "You do not know what I mean.",
    "It is true\nthen that you have said to yourself or to a colleague today \u201cthat is funny\u201d\u2019\nHe brought out the three words with ironic detachment.",
    "Gladys said \u2018It was nothing really.",
    "Just a bath being run.",
    "And I did pass the remark to Elsie\ndownstairs that it was funny somebody having a bath round about twelve o\u2019clock.\u2019\n\u2018Whose bath who had a bath\u2019\n\u2018That I couldn\u2019t say sir.",
    "We heard it going down the waste from this wing that\u2019s all and\nthat\u2019s when I said what I did to Elsie.\u2019\n\u2018You\u2019re sure it was a bath Not one of the hand\u2010basins\u2019\n\u2018Oh quite sure sir.",
    "You can\u2019t mistake bath\u2010water running away.\u2019\n112\n\n\fPoirot displaying no further desire to keep her Gladys Narracott was permitted to depart.",
    "Weston said \u2018You don\u2019t think this bath question is important do you Poirot I mean\nthere\u2019s no point to it.",
    "No bloodstains or anything like that to wash off.",
    "That\u2019s the\u2014\u2019 He\nhesitated.",
    "Poirot cut in \u2018That you would say is the advantage of strangulation No bloodstains no\nweapon\u2014nothing to get rid of or conceal Nothing is needed but physical strength\u2014and\nthe soul of a killer\u2019\nHis voice was so fierce so charged with feeling that Weston recoiled a little.",
    "Hercule Poirot smiled at him apologetically.",
    "\u2018No one\u2019 he said \u2018the bath is probably of no importance.",
    "Anyone may have had a bath.",
    "Mrs Redfern before she went to play tennis Captain Marshall Miss Darnley.",
    "As I say\nanyone.",
    "There is nothing in that.\u2019\nA police constable knocked at the door and put in his head.",
    "\u2018It\u2019s Miss Darnley sir.",
    "She says she\u2019d like to see you again for a minute.",
    "There\u2019s something\nshe forgot to tell you she says.\u2019\nWeston said \u2018We\u2019re coming down\u2014now.\u2019\nIII\nThe first person they saw was Colgate.",
    "His face was gloomy.",
    "\u2018Just a minute sir.\u2019\nWeston and Poirot followed him into Mrs Castle\u2019s office.",
    "Colgate said \u2018I\u2019ve been checking\u2010up with Heald on this typewriting business.",
    "Not a doubt\nof it it couldn\u2019t be done under an hour.",
    "Longer if you had to stop and think here and\nthere.",
    "That seems to me pretty well to settle it.",
    "And look at this letter.\u2019\nHe held it out.",
    "\u2018My dear Marshall\u2014Sorry to worry you on your holiday but an entirely unforseen\nsituation has arisen over the Burley and Tender contracts...\u2019\n\u2018Etcetera etcetera\u2019 said Colgate.",
    "\u2018Dated the 24th\u2014that\u2019s yesterday.",
    "Envelope postmarked\nyesterday evening E.C.1.",
    "and Leathercombe Bay this morning.",
    "Same typewriter used on\nenvelope and in letter.",
    "And by the contents it was clearly impossible for Marshall to\nprepare his answer beforehand.",
    "The figures arise out of the ones in the letter\u2014the whole\nthing is quite intricate.\u2019\n113\n\n\f\u2018H\u2019m\u2019 said Weston gloomily.",
    "\u2018That seems to let Marshall out.",
    "We\u2019ll have to look\nelsewhere.\u2019 He added \u2018I\u2019ve got to see Miss Darnley again.",
    "She\u2019s waiting now.\u2019\nRosamund came in crisply.",
    "Her smile held an apologetic nuance.",
    "She said \u2018I\u2019m frightfully sorry.",
    "Probably it isn\u2019t worth bothering about.",
    "But one does forget\nthings so.\u2019\n\u2018Yes Miss Darnley\u2019\nThe Chief Constable indicated a chair.",
    "She shook her shapely black head.",
    "\u2018Oh it isn\u2019t worth sitting down.",
    "It\u2019s simply this.",
    "I told you that I spent the morning lying out\non Sunny Ledge.",
    "That isn\u2019t quite accurate.",
    "I forgot that once during the morning I went\nback to the hotel and out again.\u2019\n\u2018What time was that Miss Darnley\u2019\n\u2018It must have been about a quarter\u2010past eleven.\u2019\n\u2018You went back to the hotel you said\u2019\n\u2018Yes I\u2019d forgotten my glare glasses.",
    "At first I thought I wouldn\u2019t bother and then my eyes\ngot tired and I decided to go in and get them.\u2019\n\u2018You went straight to your room and out again\u2019\n\u2018Yes.",
    "At least as a matter of fact I just looked in on Ken\u2014Captain Marshall.",
    "I heard his\nmachine going and I thought it was so stupid of him to stay indoors typing on such a lovely\nday.",
    "I thought I\u2019d tell him to come out.\u2019\n\u2018And what did Captain Marshall say\u2019\nRosamund smiled rather shamefacedly.",
    "\u2018Well when I opened the door he was typing so vigorously and frowning and looking so\nconcentrated that I just went away quietly.",
    "I don\u2019t think he even saw me come in.\u2019\n\u2018And that was\u2014at what time Miss Darnley\u2019\n\u2018Just about twenty\u2010past eleven.",
    "I noticed the clock in the hall as I went out again.\u2019\nIV\n\u2018And that puts the lid on it finally\u2019 said Inspector Colgate.",
    "\u2018The chambermaid heard him\ntyping up till five minutes to eleven.",
    "Miss Darnley saw him at twenty minutes past and the\n114\n\n\fwoman was dead at a quarter to twelve.",
    "He says he spent that hour typing in his room\nand it seems quite clear that he was typing in his room.",
    "That washes Captain Marshall\nright out.\u2019\nHe stopped then looking at Poirot with some curiosity he asked \u2018M.",
    "Poirot\u2019s looking very\nserious over something.\u2019\nPoirot said thoughtfully \u2018I was wondering why Miss Darnley suddenly volunteered this\nextra evidence.\u2019\nInspector Colgate cocked his head alertly.",
    "\u2018Think there\u2019s something fishy about it That it isn\u2019t just a question of \u201cforgetting\u201d\u2019\nHe considered for a minute or two then he said slowly \u2018Look here sir let\u2019s look at it this\nway.",
    "Supposing Miss Darnley wasn\u2019t on Sunny Ledge this morning as she says.",
    "That story\u2019s\na lie.",
    "Now suppose that after telling us her story she finds that somebody saw her\nsomewhere else or alternatively that someone went to the Ledge and didn\u2019t find her\nthere.",
    "Then she thinks up this story quick and comes and tells it to us to account for her\nabsence.",
    "You\u2019ll notice that she was careful to say Captain Marshall didn\u2019t see her when\nshe looked into his room.\u2019\nPoirot murmured \u2018Yes I noticed that.\u2019\nWeston said incredulously \u2018Are you suggesting that Miss Darnley\u2019s mixed up in this\nNonsense seems absurd to me.",
    "Why should she be\u2019\nInspector Colgate coughed.",
    "He said \u2018You\u2019ll remember what the American lady Mrs Gardener said.",
    "She sort of hinted\nthat Miss Darnley was sweet on Captain Marshall.",
    "There\u2019d be a motive there sir.\u2019\nWeston said impatiently \u2018Arlena Marshall wasn\u2019t killed by a woman.",
    "It\u2019s a man we\u2019ve got\nto look for.",
    "We\u2019ve got to stick to the men in the case.\u2019\nInspector Colgate sighed.",
    "He said \u2018Yes that\u2019s true sir.",
    "We always come back to that don\u2019t\nwe\u2019\nWeston went on \u2018Better put a constable on to timing one or two things.",
    "From the hotel\nacross the island to the top of the ladder.",
    "Let him do it running and walking.",
    "Same thing\nwith the ladder itself.",
    "And somebody had better check the time it takes to go on a float\nfrom the bathing beach to the cove.\u2019\nInspector Colgate nodded.",
    "\u2018I\u2019ll attend to all that sir\u2019 he said confidently.",
    "115\n\n\fThe Chief Constable said \u2018Think I\u2019ll go along to the cove now.",
    "See if Phillips has found\nanything.",
    "Then there\u2019s that Pixy\u2019s Cave we\u2019ve been hearing about.",
    "Ought to see if there\nare any traces of a man waiting in there.",
    "Eh Poirot What do you think\u2019\n\u2018By all means.",
    "It is a possibility.\u2019\nWeston said \u2018If somebody from outside had nipped over to the island that would be a\ngood hiding\u2010place\u2014if he knew about it.",
    "I suppose the locals know\u2019\nColgate said \u2018Don\u2019t believe the younger generation would.",
    "You see ever since this hotel\nwas started the coves have been private property.",
    "Fishermen don\u2019t go there or picnic\nparties.",
    "And the hotel people aren\u2019t local.",
    "Mrs Castle\u2019s a Londoner.\u2019\nWeston said \u2018We might take Redfern with us.",
    "He told us about it.",
    "What about you M.\nPoirot\u2019\nHercule Poirot hesitated.",
    "He said his foreign intonation very pronounced \u2018Me I am like\nMiss Brewster and Mrs Redfern I do not like to descend perpendicular ladders.\u2019\nWeston said \u2018You can go round by boat.\u2019\nAgain Hercule Poirot sighed.",
    "\u2018My stomach it is not happy on the sea.\u2019\n\u2018Nonsense man it\u2019s a beautiful day.",
    "Calm as a mill pond.",
    "You can\u2019t let us down you\nknow.\u2019\nHercule Poirot hardly looked like responding to this British adjuration.",
    "But at that\nmoment Mrs Castle poked her ladylike face and elaborate coiffure round the door.",
    "\u2018Ay\u2019m sure ay hope ay am not intruding\u2019 she said.",
    "\u2018But Mr Lane the clergyman you know\nhas just returned.",
    "Ay thought you might like to know.\u2019\n\u2018Ah yes thanks Mrs Castle.",
    "We\u2019ll see him right away.\u2019\nMrs Castle came a little farther into the room.",
    "She said \u2018Ay don\u2019t know if it is worth\nmentioning but ay have heard that the smallest incident should not be ignored\u2014\u2019\n\u2018Yes yes\u2019 said Weston impatiently.",
    "\u2018It is only that there was a lady and gentleman here about one o\u2019clock.",
    "Came over from\nthe mainland.",
    "For luncheon.",
    "They were informed that there had been an accident and that\nunder the circumstances no luncheons could be served.\u2019\n\u2018Any idea who they were\u2019\n\n116\n\n\f\u2018Ay couldn\u2019t say at all.",
    "Naturally no name was given.",
    "They expressed disappointment and a\ncertain amount of curiosity as to the nature of the accident.",
    "Ay couldn\u2019t tell them\nanything of course.",
    "Ay should say myself they were summer visitors of the better class.\u2019\nWeston said brusquely \u2018Ah well thank you for telling us.",
    "Probably not important but quite\nright\u2014er\u2014to remember everything.\u2019\n\u2018Naturally\u2019 said Mrs Castle \u2018ay wish to do my Duty\u2019\n\u2018Quite quite.",
    "Ask Mr Lane to come here.\u2019\nV\nStephen Lane strode into the room with his usual vigour.",
    "Weston said \u2018I\u2019m the Chief Constable of the County Mr Lane.",
    "I suppose you\u2019ve been told\nwhat has occurred here\u2019\n\u2018Yes\u2014oh yes\u2014I heard as soon as I got here.",
    "Terrible...",
    "Terrible...\u2019 His thin frame quivered.",
    "He said in a low voice \u2018All along\u2014ever since I arrived here\u2014I have been conscious\u2014very\nconscious\u2014of the forces of evil close at hand.\u2019\nHis eyes burning eager eyes went to Hercule Poirot.",
    "He said \u2018You remember M. Poirot Our conversation some days ago About the reality of\nevil\u2019\nWeston was studying the tall gaunt figure in some perplexity.",
    "He found it difficult to make\nthis man out.",
    "Lane\u2019s eyes came back to him.",
    "The clergyman said with a slight smile \u2018I dare\nsay that seems fantastic to you sir.",
    "We have left off believing in evil in these days.",
    "We\nhave abolished Hell fire We no longer believe in the Devil But Satan and Satan\u2019s\nemissaries were never more powerful than they are today\u2019\nWeston said \u2018Er\u2014er\u2014yes perhaps.",
    "That Mr Lane is your province.",
    "Mine is more\nprosaic\u2014to clear up a case of murder.\u2019\nStephen Lane said \u2018An awful word.",
    "Murder One of the earliest sins known on earth\u2014the\nruthless shedding of an innocent brother\u2019s blood...\u2019 He paused his eyes half closed.",
    "Then\nin a more ordinary voice he said \u2018In what way can I help you\u2019\n\u2018First of all Mr Lane will you tell me your own movements today\u2019\n\u2018Willingly.",
    "I started off early on one of my usual tramps.",
    "I am fond of walking.",
    "I have\nroamed over a good deal of the countryside round here.",
    "Today I went to St Petrock\u2010in\u2010the\u2010\nCombe.",
    "That is about seven miles from here\u2014a very pleasant walk along winding lanes up\nand down the Devon hills and valleys.",
    "I took some lunch with me and ate it in a spinney.",
    "I\nvisited the church\u2014it has some fragments\u2014only fragments alas of early glass\u2014also a\nvery interesting painted screen.\u2019\n117\n\n\f\u2018Thank you Mr Lane.",
    "Did you meet anyone on your walk\u2019\n\u2018Not to speak to.",
    "A cart passed me once and a couple of boys on bicycles and some cows.",
    "However\u2019 he smiled \u2018if you want proof of my statement I wrote my name in the book at\nthe church.",
    "You will find it there.\u2019\n\u2018You did not see anyone at the church itself\u2014the Vicar or the verger\u2019\nStephen Lane shook his head.",
    "He said \u2018No there was no one about and I was the only\nvisitor.",
    "St Petrock is a very remote spot.",
    "The village itself lies on the far side of it about half\na mile farther on.\u2019\nColonel Weston said pleasantly \u2018You mustn\u2019t think we\u2019re\u2014er\u2014doubting what you say.",
    "Just a matter of checking\u2010up on everybody.",
    "Just routine you know routine.",
    "Have to stick\nto routine in cases of this kind.\u2019\nStephen Lane said gently \u2018Oh yes I quite understand.\u2019\nWeston went on \u2018Now the next point.",
    "Is there anything you know that would assist us at\nall Anything about the dead woman Anything that could give us a pointer as to who\nmurdered her Anything you heard or saw\u2019\nStephen Lane said \u2018I heard nothing.",
    "All I can tell you is this that I knew instinctively as\nsoon as I saw her that Arlena Marshall was a focus of evil.",
    "She was Evil Evil personified\nWoman can be man\u2019s help and inspiration in life\u2014she can also be man\u2019s downfall.",
    "She can\ndrag a man down to the level of the beast.",
    "The dead woman was just such a woman.",
    "She\nappealed to everything base in a man\u2019s nature.",
    "She was a woman such as Jezebel and\nAholibah.",
    "Now\u2014she has been struck down in the middle of her wickedness\u2019\nHercule Poirot stirred.",
    "He said \u2018Not struck down\u2014strangled Strangled Mr Lane by a pair\nof human hands.\u2019\nThe clergyman\u2019s own hands trembled.",
    "The fingers writhed and twitched.",
    "He said and his\nvoice came low and choked \u2018That\u2019s horrible\u2014horrible\u2014Must you put it like that\u2019\nHercule Poirot said \u2018It is the simple truth.",
    "Have you any idea Mr Lane whose hands those\nwere\u2019\nThe other shook his head.",
    "He said \u2018I know nothing\u2014nothing...\u2019\nWeston got up.",
    "He said after a glance at Colgate to which the latter replied by an almost\nimperceptible nod \u2018Well we must get on to the Cove.\u2019\nLane said \u2018Is that where\u2014it happened\u2019\nWeston nodded.",
    "Lane said \u2018Can\u2014can I come with you\u2019\n118\n\n\fAbout to return a curt negative Weston was forestalled by Poirot.",
    "\u2018But certainly\u2019 said Poirot.",
    "\u2018Accompany me there in a boat Mr Lane.",
    "We start\nimmediately.\u2019\n\n119\n\n\f120\n\n\fChapter 9\nFor the second time that morning Patrick Redfern was rowing a boat into Pixy Cove.",
    "The\nother occupants of the boat were Hercule Poirot very pale with a hand to his stomach\nand Stephen Lane.",
    "Colonel Weston had taken the land route.",
    "Having been delayed on the\nway he arrived on the beach at the same time as the boat grounded.",
    "A police constable\nand a plainclothes sergeant were on the beach already.",
    "Weston was questioning the latter\nas the three from the boat walked up and joined him.",
    "Sergeant Phillips said \u2018I think I\u2019ve been over every inch of the beach sir.\u2019\n\u2018Good what did you find\u2019\n\u2018It\u2019s all together here sir if you\u2019d like to come and see.\u2019\nA small collection of objects was laid out neatly on a rock.",
    "There was a pair of scissors an\nempty Gold Flake packet five patent bottle tops a number of used matches three pieces\nof string one or two fragments of newspaper a fragment of a smashed pipe four buttons\nthe drumstick bone of a chicken and an empty bottle of sun\u2010bathing oil.",
    "Weston looked down appraisingly on the objects.",
    "\u2018H\u2019m\u2019 he said.",
    "\u2018Rather moderate for a beach nowadays Most people seem to confuse a\nbeach with a public rubbish dump Empty bottle\u2019s been here some time by the way the\nlabel\u2019s blurred\u2014so have most of the other things I should say.",
    "The scissors are new\nthough.",
    "Bright and shining.",
    "They weren\u2019t out in yesterday\u2019s rain Where were they\u2019\n\u2018Close by the bottom of the ladder sir.",
    "Also this bit of pipe.\u2019\n\u2018H\u2019m probably dropped by someone going up or down.",
    "Nothing to say who they belong\nto\u2019\n\u2018No sir.",
    "Quite an ordinary pair of nail scissors.",
    "Pipe\u2019s a good quality brier\u2014expensive.\u2019\nPoirot murmured thoughtfully \u2018Captain Marshall told us I think that he had mislaid his\npipe.\u2019\nWeston said \u2018Marshall\u2019s out of the picture.",
    "Anyway he\u2019s not the only person who smokes\na pipe.\u2019\nHercule Poirot was watching Stephen Lane as the latter\u2019s hand went to his pocket and\naway again.",
    "He said pleasantly \u2018You also smoke a pipe do you not Mr Lane\u2019\nThe clergyman started.",
    "He looked at Poirot.",
    "He said \u2018Yes.",
    "Oh yes.",
    "My pipe is an old friend and companion.\u2019 Putting his hand into his\npocket again he drew out a pipe filled it with tobacco and lighted it.",
    "121\n\n\fHercule Poirot moved away to where Redfern was standing his eyes blank.",
    "He said in a low voice \u2018I\u2019m glad\u2014they\u2019ve taken her away...\u2019\nStephen Lane asked \u2018Where was she found\u2019\nThe Sergeant said cheerfully \u2018Just about where you\u2019re standing sir.\u2019\nLane moved swiftly aside.",
    "He stared at the spot he had just vacated.",
    "The Sergeant went on \u2018Place where the float was drawn up agrees with putting the time\nshe arrived here at 10.45.",
    "That\u2019s going by the tide.",
    "It\u2019s turned now.\u2019\n\u2018Photography all done\u2019 asked Weston.",
    "\u2018Yes sir.\u2019\nWeston turned to Redfern.",
    "\u2018Now then man where\u2019s the entrance to this cave of yours\u2019\nPatrick Redfern was still staring down at the beach where Lane had been standing.",
    "It was\nas though he was seeing that sprawling body that was no longer there.",
    "Weston\u2019s words recalled him to himself.",
    "He said \u2018It\u2019s over here.\u2019\nHe led the way to where a great mass of tumbled\u2010down rocks were massed picturesquely\nagainst the cliff side.",
    "He went straight to where two big rocks side by side showed a\nstraight narrow cleft between them.",
    "He said \u2018The entrance is here.\u2019\nWeston said \u2018Here Doesn\u2019t look as though a man could squeeze through.\u2019\n\u2018It\u2019s deceptive you\u2019ll find sir.",
    "It can just be done.\u2019\nWeston inserted himself gingerly into the cleft.",
    "It was not as narrow as it looked.",
    "Inside\nthe space widened and proved to be a fairly roomy recess with room to stand upright and\nto move about.",
    "Hercule Poirot and Stephen Lane joined the Chief Constable.",
    "The other stayed outside.",
    "Light filtered in through the opening but Weston had also got a powerful torch which he\nplayed freely over the interior.",
    "He observed \u2018Handy place.",
    "You\u2019d never suspect it from the outside.\u2019\nHe played the torch carefully over the floor.",
    "122\n\n\fHercule Poirot was delicately sniffing the air.",
    "Noticing this Weston said \u2018Air quite fresh not fishy or seaweedy but of course this place\nis well above high water mark.\u2019\nBut to Poirot\u2019s sensitive nose the air was more than fresh.",
    "It was delicately scented.",
    "He\nknew two people who used that elusive perfume...\n\u2018Weston\u2019s torch came to rest.",
    "He said \u2018Don\u2019t see anything out of the way in here.\u2019\nPoirot\u2019s eyes rose to a ledge a little way above his head.",
    "He murmured \u2018One might\nperhaps see that there is nothing up there\u2019\nWeston said \u2018If there\u2019s anything up there it would have to be deliberately put there.",
    "Still\nwe\u2019d better have a look.\u2019\nPoirot said to Lane \u2018You are I think the tallest of us Monsieur.",
    "Could we venture to ask\nyou to make sure there is nothing resting on that ledge\u2019\nLane stretched up but he could not quite reach to the back of the shelf.",
    "Then seeing a\ncrevice in the rock he inserted a toe in it and pulled himself up by one hand.",
    "He said \u2018Hullo there\u2019s a box up here.\u2019\nIn a minute or two they were out in the sunshine examining the clergyman\u2019s find.",
    "Weston said \u2018Careful don\u2019t handle it more than you can help.",
    "May be finger\u2010prints.\u2019\nIt was a dark\u2010green tin box and bore the word Sandwiches on it.",
    "Sergeant Phillips said \u2018Left from some picnic or other I suppose.\u2019\nHe opened the lid with his handkerchief.",
    "Inside were small tin containers marked salt pepper mustard and two larger square tins\nevidently for sandwiches.",
    "Sergeant Phillips lifted the lid of the salt container.",
    "It was full to\nthe brim.",
    "He raised the next one commenting \u2018H\u2019m got salt in the pepper one too.\u2019\nThe mustard compartment also contained salt.",
    "His face suddenly alert the police sergeant opened one of the bigger square tins.",
    "That\ntoo contained the same white crystalline powder.",
    "Very gingerly Sergeant Phillips dipped a finger in and applied it to his tongue.",
    "His face changed.",
    "He said\u2014and his voice was excited \u2018This isn\u2019t salt sir.",
    "Not by a long\nway Bitter taste Seems to me it\u2019s some kind of drug.\u2019\n123\n\n\fII\n\u2018The third angle\u2019 said Colonel Weston with a groan.",
    "They were back at the hotel again.",
    "The Chief Constable went on \u2018If by any chance there\u2019s a dope gang mixed up in this it\nopens up several possibilities.",
    "First of all the dead woman may have been in with the gang\nherself.",
    "Think that\u2019s likely\u2019\nHercule Poirot said cautiously \u2018It is possible.\u2019\n\u2018She may have been a drug addict\u2019\nPoirot shook his head.",
    "He said \u2018I should doubt that.",
    "She had steady nerves radiant health there were no marks\nof hypodermic injections not that that proves anything.",
    "Some people sniff the stuff.",
    "No I\ndo not think she took drugs.\u2019\n\u2018In that case\u2019 said Weston \u2018she may have run into the business accidentally and she was\ndeliberately silenced by the people running the show.",
    "We\u2019ll know presently just what the\nstuff is.",
    "I\u2019ve sent it to Neasden.",
    "If we\u2019re on to some dope ring they\u2019re not the people to\nstick at trifles\u2014\u2019\nHe broke off as the door opened and Mr Horace Blatt came briskly into the room.",
    "Mr Blatt was looking hot.",
    "He was wiping the perspiration from his forehead.",
    "His big hearty\nvoice billowed out and filled the small room.",
    "\u2018Just this minute got back and heard the news You the Chief Constable They told me you\nwere in here.",
    "My name\u2019s Blatt\u2014Horace Blatt.",
    "Any way I can help you Don\u2019t suppose so.",
    "I\u2019ve been out in my boat since early this morning.",
    "Missed the whole blinking show.",
    "The\none day that something does happen in this out\u2010of\u2010the\u2010way spot I\u2019m not there.",
    "Just like\nlife that isn\u2019t it Hullo Poirot didn\u2019t see you at first.",
    "So you\u2019re in on this Oh well I\nsuppose you would be.",
    "Sherlock Holmes v. the local police is that it Ha ha Lestrade\u2014all\nthat stuff.",
    "I\u2019ll enjoy seeing you do a bit of fancy sleuthing.\u2019\nMr Blatt came to anchor in a chair pulled out a cigarette case and offered it to Colonel\nWeston who shook his head.",
    "He said with a slight smile \u2018I\u2019m an inveterate pipe smoker.\u2019\n\u2018Same here.",
    "I smoke cigarettes as well\u2014but nothing beats a pipe.\u2019\nColonel Weston said with suddenly geniality \u2018Then light up man.\u2019\nBlatt shook his head.",
    "124\n\n\f\u2018Not got my pipe on me at the moment.",
    "But put me wise about all this.",
    "All I\u2019ve heard so far\nis that Mrs Marshall was found murdered on one of the beaches here.\u2019\n\u2018On Pixy Cove\u2019 said Colonel Weston watching him.",
    "But Mr Blatt merely asked excitedly \u2018And she was strangled\u2019\n\u2018Yes Mr Blatt.\u2019\n\u2018Nasty\u2014very nasty.",
    "Mind you she asked for it Hot stuff\u2014tr\u00e9s moustarde\u2014eh M. Poirot\nAny idea who did it or mustn\u2019t I ask that\u2019\nWith a faint smile Colonel Weston said \u2018Well you know it\u2019s we who are supposed to ask\nthe questions.\u2019\nMr Blatt waved his cigarette.",
    "\u2018Sorry\u2014sorry\u2014my mistake.",
    "Go ahead.\u2019\n\u2018You went out sailing this morning.",
    "At what time\u2019\n\u2018Left here at a quarter to ten.\u2019\n\u2018Was any one with you\u2019\n\u2018Not a soul.",
    "All on my little lonesome.\u2019\n\u2018And where did you go\u2019\n\u2018Along the coast in the direction of Plymouth.",
    "Took lunch with me.",
    "Not much wind so I\ndidn\u2019t actually get very far.\u2019\nAfter another question or two Weston asked \u2018Now about the Marshalls Do you know\nanything that might help us\u2019\n\u2018Well I\u2019ve given you my opinion.",
    "Crime passionnel All I can tell you is it wasn\u2019t me The\nfair Arlena had no use for me.",
    "Nothing doing in that quarter.",
    "She had her own blue\u2010eyed\nboy And if you ask me Marshall was getting wise to it.\u2019\n\u2018Have you any evidence for that\u2019\n\u2018Saw him give young Redfern a dirty look once or twice.",
    "Dark horse Marshall.",
    "Looks very\nmeek and mild and as though he were half asleep all the time\u2014but that\u2019s not his\nreputation in the City.",
    "I\u2019ve heard a thing or two about him.",
    "Nearly had up for assault once.",
    "Mind you the fellow in question had put up a pretty dirty deal.",
    "Marshall had trusted him\nand the fellow had let him down cold.",
    "Particularly dirty business I believe.",
    "Marshall went\nfor him and half killed him.",
    "Fellow didn\u2019t prosecute\u2014too afraid of what might come out.",
    "I\ngive you that for what it\u2019s worth.\u2019\n125\n\n\f\u2018So you think it possible\u2019 said Poirot \u2018that Captain Marshall strangled his wife\u2019\n\u2018Not at all.",
    "Never said anything of the sort.",
    "Just letting you know that he\u2019s the sort of\nfellow who could go berserk on occasions.\u2019\nPoirot said \u2018Mr Blatt there is reason to believe that Mrs Marshall went this morning to\nPixy Cove to meet someone.",
    "Have you any idea who that someone might be\u2019\nMr Blatt winked.",

    "Christine said rather sharply \u2018What are you hinting at M. Poirot What is the meaning of\nall this\u2019\nFor answer Poirot produced a small volume bound in faded brown calf.",
    "He said \u2018Have you\never seen this before\u2019\n\u2018Why\u2014I think\u2014I\u2019m not sure\u2014yes Linda was looking into it in the village lending library\nthe other day.",

    "It made\nme wonder what it was.\u2019\nSilently Poirot displayed the title.",
    "A History of Witchcraft Sorcery and of the Compounding of Untraceable Poisons.",
    "Christine said \u2018I don\u2019t understand.",
    "What does all this mean\u2019\nPoirot said gravely.",
    "\u2018It may mean Madame a good deal.\u2019\nShe looked at him inquiringly but he did not go on.",
    "Instead he asked \u2018One more question\nMadame did you take a bath that morning before you went out to play tennis\u2019\nChristine stared again.",
    "\u2018A bath No.",
    "I would have had no time and anyway I didn\u2019t want a bath\u2014not before\ntennis.",
    "I might have had one after.\u2019\n\u2018Did you use your bathroom at all when you came in\u2019\n\u2018I sponged my face and hands that\u2019s all.\u2019\n\u2018You did not turn on the bath at all\u2019\n137\n\n\f\u2018No I\u2019m sure I didn\u2019t.\u2019\nPoirot nodded.",
    "He said \u2018It is of no importance.\u2019\nIV\nHercule Poirot stood by the table where Mrs Gardener was wrestling with a jig\u2010saw.",
    "She looked up and jumped.",
    "\u2018Why M. Poirot how very quietly you came up beside me I never heard you.",
    "Have you\njust come back from the inquest You know the very thought of that inquest makes me so\nnervous I don\u2019t know what to do.",
    "That\u2019s why I\u2019m doing this puzzle.",
    "I just felt I couldn\u2019t sit\noutside on the beach as usual.",
    "As Mr Gardener knows when my nerves are all upset\nthere\u2019s nothing like one of these puzzles for calming me.",
    "There now where does this\nwhite piece fit in It must be part of the fur rug but I don\u2019t seem to see...\u2019\nGently Poirot\u2019s hand took the piece from her.",
    "He said \u2018It fits Madame here.",
    "It is part of\nthe cat.\u2019\n\u2018It can\u2019t be.",
    "It\u2019s a black cat.\u2019\n\u2018A black cat yes but you see the tip of the black cat\u2019s tail happens to be white.\u2019\n\u2018Why so it does How clever of you But I do think the people who make puzzles are kind\nof mean.",
    "They just go out of their way to deceive you.\u2019\nShe fitted in another piece and then resumed.",
    "\u2018You know M. Poirot I\u2019ve been watching you this last day or two.",
    "I just wanted to watch\nyou detecting if you know what I mean\u2014not that it doesn\u2019t sound rather heartless put like\nthat as though it were all a game\u2014and a poor creature killed.",
    "Oh dear every time I think\nof it I get the shivers I told Mr Gardener this morning I\u2019d just got to get away from here\nand now the inquest\u2019s over he thinks we\u2019ll be able to leave tomorrow and that\u2019s a\nblessing I\u2019m sure.",
    "But about detecting I would so like to know your methods\u2014you know\nI\u2019d feel privileged if you\u2019d just explain it to me.\u2019\nHercule Poirot said \u2018It is a little like your puzzle Madame.",
    "One assembles the pieces.",
    "It is\nlike a mosaic\u2014many colours and patterns\u2014and every strange\u2010shaped little piece must be\nfitted into its own place.\u2019\n\u2018Now isn\u2019t that interesting Why I\u2019m sure you explain it just too beautifully.\u2019\nPoirot went on \u2018And sometimes it is like that piece of your puzzle just now.",
    "One arranges\nvery methodically the pieces of the puzzle\u2014one sorts the colours\u2014and then perhaps a\npiece of one colour that should fit in with\u2014say the fur rug fits in instead in a black cat\u2019s\ntail.\u2019\n138\n\n\f\u2018Why if that doesn\u2019t sound too fascinating And are there a great many pieces M. Poirot\u2019\n\u2018Yes Madame.",
    "Almost everyone here in this hotel has given me a piece for my puzzle.",
    "You\namongst them.\u2019\n\u2018Me\u2019 Mrs Gardener\u2019s tone was shrill.",
    "\u2018Yes a remark of yours Madame was exceedingly helpful.",
    "I might say it was illuminating.\u2019\n\u2018Well if that isn\u2019t too lovely Can\u2019t you tell me some more M. Poirot\u2019\n\u2018Ah Madame I reserve the explanations for the last chapter.\u2019\nMrs Gardener murmured \u2018If that isn\u2019t just too bad\u2019\nV\nHercule Poirot tapped gently on the door of Captain Marshall\u2019s room.",
    "Inside there was the sound of a typewriter.",
    "A curt \u2018Come in\u2019 came from the room and Poirot entered.",
    "Captain Marshall\u2019s back was turned to him.",
    "He was sitting typing at the table between the\nwindows.",
    "He did not turn his head but his eyes met Poirot\u2019s in the mirror that hung on the\nwall directly in front of him.",
    "He said irritably \u2018Well M. Poirot what is it\u2019\nPoirot said quickly \u2018A thousand apologies for intruding.",
    "You are busy\u2019\nMarshall said shortly \u2018I am rather.\u2019\nPoirot said \u2018It is one little question that I would like to ask you.\u2019\nMarshall said \u2018My God I\u2019m sick of answering questions.",
    "I\u2019ve answered the police\nquestions.",
    "I don\u2019t feel called upon to answer yours.\u2019\nPoirot said \u2018Mine is a very simple one.",
    "Only this.",
    "On the morning of your wife\u2019s death did\nyou have a bath after you finished typing and before you went out to play tennis\u2019\n\u2018A bath No of course I didn\u2019t I\u2019d had a bathe only an hour earlier\u2019\nHercule Poirot said \u2018Thank you.",
    "That is all.\u2019\n\u2018But look here.",
    "Oh\u2014\u2019 the other paused irresolutely.",
    "Poirot withdrew gently closing the door.",
    "Kenneth Marshall said \u2018The fellow\u2019s crazy\u2019\n139\n\n\fVI\nJust outside the bar Poirot encountered Mr Gardener.",
    "He was carrying two cocktails and\nwas clearly on his way to where Mrs Gardener was ensconced with her jig\u2010saw.",
    "He smiled at Poirot in genial fashion.",
    "\u2018Care to join us M. Poirot\u2019\nPoirot shook his head.",
    "He said \u2018What did you think of the inquest Mr Gardener\u2019\nMr Gardener lowered his voice.",
    "He said \u2018Seemed kind of indeterminate to me.",
    "Your\npolice I gather have got something up their sleeves.\u2019\n\u2018It is possible\u2019 said Hercule Poirot.",
    "Mr Gardener lowered his voice still further.",
    "\u2018I shall be glad to get Mrs Gardener away.",
    "She\u2019s a very very sensitive woman and this\naffair has got on her nerves.",
    "She\u2019s very highly strung.\u2019\nHercule Poirot said \u2018Will you permit me Mr Gardener to ask you one question\u2019\n\u2018Why certainly M. Poirot.",
    "Delighted to assist in any way I can.\u2019\nHercule Poirot said \u2018You are a man of the world\u2014a man I think of considerable acumen.",
    "What frankly was your opinion of the late Mrs Marshall\u2019\nMr Gardener\u2019s eyebrows rose in surprise.",
    "He glanced cautiously round and lowered his\nvoice.",
    "\u2018Well M. Poirot I\u2019ve heard a few things that have been kind of going around if you get\nme especially among the women.\u2019 Poirot nodded.",
    "\u2018But if you ask me I\u2019ll tell you my candid\nopinion and that is that that woman was pretty much of a darned fool\u2019\nHercule Poirot said thoughtfully \u2018Now that is very interesting.\u2019\nVII\nRosamund Darnley said \u2018So it\u2019s my turn is it\u2019\n\u2018Pardon\u2019\nShe laughed.",
    "\u2018The other day the Chief Constable held his inquisition.",
    "You sat by.",
    "Today I\nthink you are conducting your own unofficial inquiry.",
    "I\u2019ve been watching you.",
    "First Mrs\nRedfern then I caught a glimpse of you through the lounge window where Mrs Gardener\nis doing her hateful jig\u2010saw puzzle.",
    "Now it\u2019s my turn.\u2019\n140\n\n\fHercule Poirot sat down beside her.",
    "They were on Sunny Ledge.",
    "Below them the sea\nshowed a deep\u2010glowing green.",
    "Farther out it was a pale dazzling blue.",
    "Poirot said \u2018You are very intelligent Mademoiselle.",
    "I have thought so ever since I arrived\nhere.",
    "It would be a pleasure to discuss this business with you.\u2019\nRosamund Darnley said softly \u2018You want to know what I think about the whole thing\u2019\n\u2018It would be most interesting.\u2019\nRosamund said \u2018I think it\u2019s really very simple.",
    "The clue is in the woman\u2019s past.\u2019\n\u2018The past Not the present\u2019\n\u2018Oh not necessarily the very remote past.",
    "I look at it like this.",
    "Arlena Marshall was\nattractive fatally attractive to men.",
    "It\u2019s possible I think that she also tired of them rather\nquickly.",
    "Amongst her\u2014followers shall we say\u2014was one who resented that.",
    "Oh don\u2019t\nmisunderstand me it won\u2019t be someone who sticks out a mile.",
    "Probably some tepid little\nman vain and sensitive\u2014the kind of man who broods.",
    "I think he followed her down here\nwaited his opportunity and killed her.\u2019\n\u2018You mean that he was an outsider that he came from the mainland\u2019\n\u2018Yes.",
    "He probably hid in that cave until he got his chance.\u2019\nPoirot shook his head.",
    "He said \u2018Would she go there to meet such a man as you describe\nNo she would laugh and not go.\u2019\nRosamund said \u2018She mayn\u2019t have known she was going to meet him.",
    "He may have sent\nher a message in some other person\u2019s name.\u2019\nPoirot murmured \u2018That is possible.\u2019\nThen he said \u2018But you forget one thing Mademoiselle.",
    "A man bent on murder could not\nrisk coming in broad daylight across the causeway and past the hotel.",
    "Someone might\nhave seen him.\u2019\n\u2018They might have\u2014but I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s certain.",
    "I think it\u2019s quite possible that he could\nhave come without anyone noticing him at all.\u2019\n\u2018It would be possible yes that I grant you.",
    "But the point is that he could not count on that\npossibility.\u2019\nRosamund said \u2018Aren\u2019t you forgetting something The weather.\u2019\n\u2018The weather\u2019\n\n141\n\n\f\u2018Yes.",
    "The day of the murder was a glorious day but the day before remember there was\nrain and thick mist.",
    "Anyone could come on to the island then without being seen.",
    "He had\nonly to go down to the beach and spend the night in the cave.",
    "That mist M. Poirot is\nimportant.\u2019\nPoirot looked at her thoughtfully for a minute or two.",
    "He said \u2018You know there is a good\ndeal in what you have just said.\u2019\nRosamund flushed.",
    "She said \u2018That\u2019s my theory for what it is worth.",
    "Now tell me yours.\u2019\n\u2018Ah\u2019 said Hercule Poirot.",
    "He stared down at the sea.",
    "\u2018Eh bien Mademoiselle.",
    "I am a very simple person.",
    "I always incline to the belief that the\nmost likely person committed the crime.",
    "At the very beginning it seemed to me that one\nperson was very clearly indicated.\u2019\nRosamund\u2019s voice hardened a little.",
    "She said \u2018Go on.\u2019\nHercule Poirot went on.",
    "\u2018But you see there is what you call a snag in the way It seems that it was impossible for\nthat person to have committed the crime.\u2019\nHe heard the quick expulsion of her breath.",
    "She said rather breathlessly \u2018Well\u2019\nHercule Poirot shrugged his shoulders.",
    "\u2018Well what do we do about it That is my problem.\u2019 He paused and then went on.",
    "\u2018May I\nask you a question\u2019\n\u2018Certainly.\u2019\nShe faced him alert and vigilant.",
    "But the question that came was an unexpected one.",
    "\u2018When you came in to change for tennis that morning did you have a bath\u2019\nRosamund stared at him.",
    "\u2018A bath What do you mean\u2019\n\u2018That is what I mean.",
    "A bath The receptacle of porcelain one turns the taps and fills it\none gets in one gets out and ghoosh\u2014ghoosh\u2014ghoosh the water goes down the waste\u2010\npipe\u2019\n\u2018M.",
    "Poirot are you quite mad\u2019\n\u2018No I am extremely sane.\u2019\n142\n\n\f\u2018Well anyway I didn\u2019t take a bath.\u2019\n\u2018Ha\u2019 said Poirot.",
    "\u2018So nobody took a bath.",
    "That is extremely interesting.\u2019\n\u2018But why should anyone take a bath\u2019\nHercule Poirot said \u2018Why indeed\u2019\nRosamund said with some exasperation \u2018I suppose this is the Sherlock Holmes touch\u2019\nHercule Poirot smiled.",
    "Then he sniffed the air delicately.",
    "\u2018Will you permit me to be impertinent Mademoiselle\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019m sure you couldn\u2019t be impertinent M. Poirot.\u2019\n\u2018That is very kind of you.",
    "Then may I venture to say that the scent you use is delicious\u2014it\nhas a nuance\u2014a delicate elusive charm.\u2019 He waved his hands and then added in a\npractical voice \u2018Gabrielle No 8 I think\u2019\n\u2018How clever you are.",
    "Yes I always use it.\u2019\n\u2018So did the late Mrs Marshall.",
    "It is chic eh And very expensive\u2019\nRosamund shrugged her shoulders with a faint smile.",
    "Poirot said \u2018You sat here where we are now Mademoiselle on the morning of the crime.",
    "You were seen here or at least your sunshade was seen by Miss Brewster and Mr Redfern\nas they passed on the sea.",
    "During the morning Mademoiselle are you sure you did not\nhappen to go down to Pixy Cove and enter the cave there\u2014the famous Pixy\u2019s Cave\u2019\nRosamund turned her head and stared at him.",
    "She said in a quiet level voice \u2018Are you\nasking me if I killed Arlena Marshall\u2019\n\u2018No I am asking you if you went into the Pixy\u2019s Cave\u2019\n\u2018I don\u2019t even know where it is.",
    "Why should I go into it For what reason\u2019\n\u2018On the day of the crime Mademoiselle somebody had been in that cave who used\nGabrielle No 8.\u2019\nRosamund said sharply \u2018You\u2019ve just said yourself M. Poirot that Arlena Marshall used\nGabrielle No 8.",
    "She was on the beach there that day.",
    "Presumably she went into the cave.\u2019\n\u2018Why should she go into the cave It is dark there and narrow and very uncomfortable.\u2019\n143\n\n\fRosamund said impatiently \u2018Don\u2019t ask me for reasons.",
    "Since she was actually at the cove\nshe was by far the most likely person.",
    "I\u2019ve told you already I never left this place the whole\nmorning.\u2019\n\u2018Except for the time when you went into the hotel to Captain Marshall\u2019s room.\u2019 Poirot\nreminded her.",
    "\u2018Yes of course.",
    "I\u2019d forgotten that.\u2019\nPoirot said \u2018And you were wrong Mademoiselle when you thought that Captain Marshall\ndid not see you.\u2019\nRosamund said incredulously \u2018Kenneth did see me Did\u2014did he say so\u2019\nPoirot nodded.",
    "\u2018He saw you Mademoiselle in the mirror that hangs over the table.\u2019\nRosamund caught her breath.",
    "She said \u2018Oh I see.\u2019\nPoirot was no longer looking out to sea.",
    "He was looking at Rosamund Darnley\u2019s hands as\nthey lay folded in her lap.",
    "They were well\u2010shaped hands beautifully moulded with very\nlong fingers.",
    "Rosamund shooting a quick look at him followed the direction of his eyes.",
    "She said sharply \u2018What are you looking at my hands for Do you think\u2014do you think\u2014\u2019\nPoirot said \u2018Do I think\u2014what Mademoiselle\u2019\nRosamund Darnley said \u2018Nothing.\u2019\nVIII\nIt was perhaps an hour later that Hercule Poirot came to the top of the path leading to\nGull Cove.",
    "There was someone sitting on the beach.",
    "A slight figure in a red shirt and dark\nblue shorts.",
    "Poirot descended the path stepping carefully in his tight smart shoes.",
    "Linda Marshall turned her head sharply.",
    "He thought that she shrank a little.",
    "Her eyes as he came and lowered himself gingerly to the shingle beside her rested on\nhim with the suspicion and alertness of a trapped animal.",
    "He realized with a pang how\nyoung and vulnerable she was.",
    "She said \u2018What is it What do you want\u2019\nHercule Poirot did not answer for a minute or two.",
    "Then he said \u2018The other day you told\nthe Chief Constable that you were fond of your stepmother and that she was kind to you.\u2019\n144\n\n\f\u2018Well\u2019\n\u2018That was not true was it Mademoiselle\u2019\n\u2018Yes it was.\u2019\nPoirot said \u2018She may not have been actively unkind\u2014that I will grant.",
    "But you were not\nfond of her\u2014Oh no\u2014I think you disliked her very much.",
    "That was very plain to see.\u2019\nLinda said \u2018Perhaps I didn\u2019t like her very much.",
    "But one can\u2019t say that when a person is\ndead.",
    "It wouldn\u2019t be decent.\u2019\nPoirot sighed.",
    "He said \u2018They taught you that at your school\u2019\n\u2018More or less I suppose.\u2019\nHercule Poirot said \u2018When a person has been murdered it is more important to be\ntruthful than to be decent.\u2019\nLinda said \u2018I suppose you would say a thing like that.\u2019\n\u2018I would say it and I do say it.",
    "It is my business you see to find out who killed Arlena\nMarshall.\u2019\nLinda muttered \u2018I want to forget it all.",
    "It\u2019s so horrible.\u2019\nPoirot said gently \u2018But you can\u2019t forget can you\u2019\nLinda said \u2018I suppose some beastly madman killed her.\u2019\nHercule Poirot murmured \u2018No I do not think it was quite like that.\u2019\nLinda caught her breath.",
    "She said \u2018You sound\u2014as though you knew\u2019\nPoirot said \u2018Perhaps I do know.\u2019 He paused and went on \u2018Will you trust me my child to\ndo the best I can for you in your bitter trouble\u2019\nLinda sprang up.",
    "She said \u2018I haven\u2019t any trouble.",
    "There is nothing you can do for me.",
    "I\ndon\u2019t know what you are talking about.\u2019\nPoirot said watching her \u2018I am talking about candles...\u2019\nHe saw the terror leap into her eyes.",
    "She cried \u2018I won\u2019t listen to you.",
    "I won\u2019t listen.\u2019\nShe ran across the beach swift as a young gazelle and went flying up the zigzag path.",
    "Poirot shook his head.",
    "He looked grave and troubled.",
    "145\n\n\f146\n\n\fChapter 11\nInspector Colgate was reporting to the Chief Constable.",
    "\u2018I\u2019ve got on to one thing sir and something pretty sensational.",

    "Blackmail all right.\u2019\nThe Chief Constable nodded.",
    "\u2018Certainly looks like it.",
    "And the blackmailer is here in this hotel.",
    "That means it must be one\nof those three men.",

    "It seems to me that Stephen Lane is at least a possibility.",
    "The late Mrs Marshall\nwas a pretty good example of what a clergyman would call a Scarlet Woman\u2014hair and\ngoings on and all.",
    "Seems to me it\u2019s not impossible he may have felt it his appointed task to\ndispose of her.",
    "That is if he is really batty.\u2019\n\u2018Nothing to fit in with the blackmail theory\u2019\n\u2018No sir I think we can wash him out as far as that\u2019s concerned.",
    "Has some private means of\nhis own but not very much and no sudden increase lately.\u2019\n\u2018What about his story of his movements on the day of the crime\u2019\n\u2018Can\u2019t get any confirmation of them.",
    "Nobody remembers meeting a parson in the lanes.",
    "As\nto the book at the church the last entry was three days before and nobody had looked at\nit for about a fortnight.",
    "He could have quite easily gone over the day before say or even a\ncouple of days before and dated his entry the 25th.\u2019\nWeston nodded.",
    "He said \u2018And the third man\u2019\n\u2018Horace Blatt It\u2019s my opinion sir that there\u2019s definitely something fishy there.",
    "Pays\nincome\u2010tax on a sum far exceeding what he makes out of his hardware business.",
    "And mind\nyou he\u2019s a slippery customer.",
    "He could probably cook up a reasonable statement\u2014he\ngambles a bit on the Stock Exchange and he\u2019s in with one or two shady deals.",
    "Oh yes\nthere may be plausible explanations but there\u2019s no getting away from it that he\u2019s been\nmaking pretty big sums from unexplained sources for some years now.\u2019\n\u2018In fact\u2019 said Weston \u2018the idea is that Mr Horace Blatt is a successful blackmailer by\nprofession\u2019\n\u2018Either that sir or it\u2019s dope.",
    "I saw Chief Inspector Ridgeway who\u2019s in charge of the dope\nbusiness and he was no end keen.",
    "Seems there\u2019s been a good bit of heroin coming in\nlately.",
    "They\u2019re on to the small distributors and they know more or less who\u2019s running it\nthe other end but it\u2019s the way it\u2019s coming into the country that\u2019s baffled them so far.\u2019\nWeston said \u2018If the Marshall woman\u2019s death is the result of her getting mixed up\ninnocently or otherwise with the dope\u2010running stunt then we\u2019d better hand the whole\nthing over to Scotland Yard.",
    "It\u2019s their pigeon.",
    "Eh What do you say\u2019\nInspector Colgate said rather regretfully \u2018I\u2019m afraid you\u2019re right sir.",
    "If it\u2019s dope then it\u2019s a\ncase for the Yard.\u2019\nWeston said after a moment or two\u2019s thought \u2018It really seems the most likely\nexplanation.\u2019\nColgate nodded gloomily.",
    "148\n\n\f\u2018Yes it does.",
    "Marshall\u2019s right out of it\u2014though I did get some information that might have\nbeen useful if his alibi hadn\u2019t been so good.",
    "Seems his firm is very near the rocks.",
    "Not his\nfault or his partner\u2019s just the general result of the crisis last year and the general state of\ntrade and finance.",
    "And as far as he knew he\u2019d come into fifty thousand pounds if his wife\ndied.",
    "And fifty thousand would have been a very useful sum.\u2019\nHe sighed.",
    "\u2018Seems a pity when a man\u2019s got two perfectly good motives for murder that he can be\nproved to have had nothing to do with it\u2019\nWeston smiled.",
    "\u2018Cheer up Colgate.",
    "There\u2019s still a chance we may distinguish ourselves.",
    "There\u2019s the\nblackmail angle still and there\u2019s the batty parson but personally I think the dope solution\nis far the most likely.\u2019 He added \u2018And if it was one of the dope gang who put her out we\u2019ll\nhave been instrumental in helping Scotland Yard to solve the dope problem.",
    "In fact take it\nall round one way or another we\u2019ve done pretty well.\u2019\nAn unwilling smile showed on Colgate\u2019s face.",

    "The one signed J.N.",
    "Nothing doing.",

    "Everything there is to get we\u2019ve got\nsir.\u2019\nWeston said \u2018So now it\u2019s up to us.\u2019 He paused and then added \u2018Seen anything of our\nBelgian colleague Does he know all you\u2019ve told me\u2019\nColgate said with a grin \u2018He\u2019s a queer little cuss isn\u2019t he D\u2019you know what he asked me\nday before yesterday He wanted particulars of any cases of strangulation in the last three\nyears.\u2019\nColonel Weston sat up.",

    "A little to his left was the beginning of the steel ladder that led down to Pixy Cove.",

    "Of the beach itself\nlittle could be seen from the top owing to the overhang of the cliff.",

    "Don\u2019t want to be overheard.\u2019\nPoirot said \u2018You are wise.\u2019\nColgate said \u2018I don\u2019t mind telling you M. Poirot that I\u2019ve been interested in those cases\nmyself\u2014though perhaps I shouldn\u2019t have thought about them if you hadn\u2019t asked for\nthem.\u2019 He paused \u2018I\u2019ve been interested in one case in particular.\u2019\n\u2018Alice Corrigan\u2019\n\u2018Alice Corrigan.\u2019 He paused.",

    "That\u2019s because they\u2019d pitched on the husband as the guilty party.",
    "Don\u2019t quite\nknow why except that he was a bit of what the Press calls a \u201cmystery man\u201d\u2014not much\nknown about him\u2014who he was or where he came from.",
    "She\u2019d married him against her\npeople\u2019s wishes she\u2019d a bit of money of her own\u2014and she\u2019d insured her life in his\nfavour\u2014all that was enough to raise suspicion as I think you\u2019ll agree sir\u2019\n151\n\n\fPoirot nodded.",
    "\u2018But when it came down to brass tacks the husband was washed right out of the picture.",
    "The body was discovered by one of these women hikers\u2014hefty young women in shorts.",
    "She was an absolutely competent and reliable witness\u2014games mistress at a school in\nLancashire.",
    "She noted the time when she found the body\u2014it was exactly four\u2010fifteen\u2014\nand gave it as her opinion that the woman had been dead quite a short time\u2014not more\nthan ten minutes.",
    "That fitted in well enough with the police surgeon\u2019s view when he\nexamined the body at 5.45.",
    "She left everything as it was and tramped across country to\nBagshot police station where she reported the death.",
    "Now from three o\u2019clock to four\u2010ten\nEdward Corrigan was in the train coming down from London where he\u2019d gone up for the\nday on business.",
    "Four other people were in the carriage with him.",
    "From the station he\ntook the local bus two of his fellow passengers travelling by it also.",
    "He got off at the Pine\nRidge Caf\u00e9 where he\u2019d arranged to meet his wife for tea.",
    "Time then was four twenty\u2010five.",
    "He ordered tea for them both but said not to bring it till she came.",
    "Then he walked about\noutside waiting for her.",
    "When by five o\u2019clock she hadn\u2019t turned up he was getting\nalarmed\u2014thought she might have sprained her ankle.",
    "The arrangement was that she was\nto walk across the moors from the village where they were staying to the Pine Ridge Caf\u00e9\nand go home by bus.",
    "Caesar\u2019s Grove is not far from the caf\u00e9 and it\u2019s thought that as she\nwas ahead of time she sat down there to admire the view for a bit before going on and\nthat some tramp or madman came upon her there and caught her unawares.",
    "Once the\nhusband was proved to be out of it naturally they connected up her death with that of\nNellie Parsons\u2014that rather flighty servant girl who was found strangled in Marley Copse.",
    "They decided that the same man was responsible for both crimes but they never caught\nhim\u2014and what\u2019s more they never came near to catching him Drew a blank everywhere.\u2019\nHe paused and then he said slowly \u2018And now\u2014here\u2019s a third woman strangled\u2014and a\ncertain gentleman we won\u2019t name right on the spot.\u2019\nHe stopped.",
    "His small shrewd eyes came round to Poirot.",
    "He waited hopefully.",
    "Poirot\u2019s lips moved.",
    "Inspector Colgate leaned forward.",
    "Poirot was murmuring \u2018\u2014so difficult to know which pieces are part of the fur rug and\nwhich are the cat\u2019s tail.\u2019\n\u2018I beg pardon sir\u2019 said Inspector Colgate startled.",
    "Poirot said quickly \u2018I apologize.",
    "I was following a train of thought of my own.\u2019\n\u2018What\u2019s this about a fur rug and a cat\u2019\n\u2018Nothing\u2014nothing at all.\u2019 He paused.",
    "\u2018Tell me Inspector Colgate if you suspected\nsomeone of telling lies\u2014many many lies but you had no proof what would you do\u2019\nInspector Colgate considered.",
    "152\n\n\f\u2018It\u2019s difficult that is.",
    "But it\u2019s my opinion that if anyone tells enough lies they\u2019re bound to\ntrip up in the end.\u2019\nPoirot nodded.",
    "\u2018Yes that is very true.",
    "You see it is only in my mind that certain statements are lies.",
    "I think\nthat they are lies but I cannot know that they are lies.",
    "But one might perhaps make a\ntest\u2014a test of one little not very noticeable lie.",
    "And if that were proved to be a lie\u2014why\nthen one would know that all the rest were lies too\u2019\nInspector Colgate looked at him curiously.",
    "\u2018Your mind works a funny way doesn\u2019t it sir But I dare say it comes out all right in the\nend.",
    "If you\u2019ll excuse me asking what put you on to asking about strangulation cases in\ngeneral\u2019\nPoirot said slowly \u2018You have a word in your language\u2014slick.",
    "This crime seemed to me a\nvery slick crime It made me wonder if perhaps it was not a first attempt.\u2019\nInspector Colgate said \u2018I see.\u2019\nPoirot went on \u2018I said to myself let us examine past crimes of a similar kind and if there is\na crime that closely resembles this one\u2014eh bien we shall have there a very valuable clue.\u2019\n\u2018You mean using the same method of death sir\u2019\n\u2018No no I mean more than that.",
    "The death of Nellie Parsons for instance tells me nothing.",
    "But the death of Alice Corrigan\u2014tell me Inspector Colgate do you not notice one striking\nform of similarity in this crime\u2019\nInspector Colgate turned the problem over in his mind.",
    "He said at last.",
    "\u2018No sir I can\u2019t say that I do really.",
    "Unless it\u2019s that in each case the husband has got a cast\u2010\niron alibi.\u2019\nPoirot said softly \u2018Ah so you have noticed that\u2019\nIV\n\u2018Ha Poirot.",
    "Glad to see you.",
    "Come in.",
    "Just the man I want.\u2019\nHercule Poirot responded to the invitation.",
    "The Chief Constable pushed over a box of cigarettes took one himself and lighted it.",
    "Between puffs he said \u2018I\u2019ve decided more or less on a course of action.",
    "But I\u2019d like your\nopinion on it before I act decisively.\u2019\nHercule Poirot said \u2018Tell me my friend.\u2019\n153\n\n\fWeston said \u2018I\u2019ve decided to call in Scotland Yard and hand the case over to them.",
    "In my\nopinion although there have been grounds for suspicion against one or two people the\nwhole case hinges on dope smuggling.",
    "It seems clear to me that that place Pixy\u2019s Cave\nwas a definite rendezvous for the stuff.\u2019\nPoirot nodded.",
    "\u2018I agree.\u2019\n\u2018Good man.",
    "And I\u2019m pretty certain who our dope smuggler is.",
    "Horace Blatt.\u2019\nAgain Poirot assented.",
    "He said \u2018That too is indicated.\u2019\n\u2018I see our minds have both worked the same way.",
    "Blatt used to go sailing in that boat of\nhis.",
    "Sometimes he\u2019d invite people to go with him but most of the time he went out alone.",
    "He had some rather conspicuous red sails on that boat but we\u2019ve found that he had some\nwhite sails as well stowed away.",
    "I think he sailed out on a good day to an appointed spot\nand was met by another boat\u2014sailing boat or motor yacht\u2014something of the kind and\nthe stuff was handed over.",
    "Then Blatt would run ashore into Pixy Cove at a suitable time\nof day\u2014\u2019\nHercule Poirot smiled \u2018Yes yes at half\u2010past one.",
    "The hour of the British lunch when\neveryone is quite sure to be in the dining\u2010room.",
    "The island is private.",
    "It is not a place\nwhere outsiders come for picnics.",
    "People take their tea sometimes from the hotel to Pixy\nCove in the afternoon when the sun is on it or if they want a picnic they would go\nsomewhere far afield many miles away.\u2019\nThe Chief Constable nodded.",
    "\u2018Quite\u2019 he said.",
    "\u2018Therefore Blatt ran ashore there and stowed the stuff on that ledge in\nthe cave.",
    "Somebody else was to pick it up there in due course.\u2019\nPoirot murmured \u2018There was a couple you remember who came to the island for lunch\non the day of the murder That would be a way of getting the stuff.",
    "Some summer visitors\nfrom a hotel on the Moor or at St Loo come over to Smugglers\u2019 Island.",
    "They announce that\nthey will have lunch.",
    "They walk round the island first.",
    "How easy to descend to the beach\npick up the sandwich box place it no doubt in Madame\u2019s bathing\u2010bag which she carries\u2014\nand return for lunch to the hotel\u2014a little late perhaps say at ten minutes to two having\nenjoyed their walk whilst everyone else was in the dining\u2010room.\u2019\nWeston said \u2018Yes it all sounds practicable enough.",
    "Now these dope organizations are\npretty ruthless.",
    "If any one blundered in and got wise to things they wouldn\u2019t make any\nbones about silencing that person.",
    "It seems to me that that is the right explanation of\nArlena Marshall\u2019s death.",
    "It\u2019s possible that on that morning Blatt was actually at the cove\nstowing the stuff away.",
    "His accomplices were to come for it that very day.",
    "Arlena arrives\non her float and sees him going into the cave with the box.",
    "She asks him about it and he\nkills her then and there and sheers off in his boat as quick as possible.\u2019\n154\n\n\fPoirot said \u2018You think definitely that Blatt is the murderer\u2019\n\u2018It seems the most probable solution.",
    "Of course it\u2019s possible that Arlena might have got on\nto the truth earlier said something to Blatt about it and some other member of the gang\nfixed a fake appointment with her and did her in.",
    "As I say I think the best course is to hand\nthe case over to Scotland Yard.",
    "They\u2019ve a far better chance than we have of proving Blatt\u2019s\nconnection with the gang.\u2019\nHercule Poirot nodded thoughtfully.",
    "Weston said \u2018You think that\u2019s the wise thing to do\u2014eh\u2019\nPoirot was thoughtful.",
    "He said at last \u2018It may be.\u2019\n\u2018Dash it all Poirot have you got something up your sleeve or haven\u2019t you\u2019\nPoirot said gravely \u2018If I have I am not sure that I can prove it.\u2019\nWeston said \u2018Of course I know that you and Colgate have other ideas.",
    "Seems a bit\nfantastic to me but I\u2019m bound to admit there may be something in it.",
    "But even if you\u2019re\nright.",
    "I still think it\u2019s a case for the Yard.",
    "We\u2019ll give them the facts and they can work in\nwith the Surrey police.",
    "What I feel is that it isn\u2019t really a case for us.",
    "It\u2019s not sufficiently\nlocalized.\u2019\nHe paused.",
    "\u2018What do you think Poirot What do you feel ought to be done about it\u2019\nPoirot seemed lost in thought.",
    "At last he said \u2018I know what I should like to do.\u2019\n\u2018Yes man.\u2019\nPoirot murmured \u2018I should like to go for a picnic.\u2019\nColonel Weston stared at him.",
    "155\n\n\f156\n\n\fChapter 12\n\u2018A picnic M. Poirot\u2019\nEmily Brewster stared at him as though he were out of his senses.",
    "Poirot said engagingly \u2018It sounds to you does it not very outrageous But indeed it seems\nto me a most admirable idea.",
    "We need something of the every day the usual to restore\nlife to the normal.",
    "I am most anxious to see something of Dartmoor the weather is good.",
    "It will\u2014how shall I say it will cheer everybody up So aid me in this matter.",
    "Persuade\neveryone.\u2019\nThe idea met with unexpected success.",
    "Everyone was at first dubious and then grudgingly\nadmitted it might not be such a bad idea after all.",
    "It was not suggested that Captain Marshall should be asked.",
    "He had himself announced\nthat he had to go to Plymouth that day.",
    "Mr Blatt was of the party enthusiastically so.",
    "He\nwas determined to be the life and soul of it.",
    "Besides him there was Emily Brewster the\nRedferns Stephen Lane the Gardeners who were persuaded to delay their departure by\none day Rosamund Darnley and Linda.",
    "Poirot had been eloquent to Rosamund and had dwelt on the advantage it would be to\nLinda to have something to take her out of herself.",
    "To this Rosamund agreed.",
    "She said\n\u2018You\u2019re quite right.",
    "The shock has been very bad for a child of that age.",
    "It has made her\nterribly jumpy.\u2019\n\u2018That is only natural Mademoiselle.",
    "But at any age one soon forgets.",
    "Persuade her to\ncome.",
    "You can I know.\u2019\nMajor Barry had refused firmly.",
    "He said he didn\u2019t like picnics.",
    "\u2018Lots of baskets to carry\u2019 he\nsaid.",
    "\u2018And darned uncomfortable.",
    "Eating my food at a table\u2019s good enough for me.\u2019\nThe party assembled at ten o\u2019clock.",
    "Three cars had been ordered.",
    "Mr Blatt was loud and\ncheerful imitating a tourist guide.",
    "\u2018This way ladies and gentlemen\u2014this way for Dartmoor.",
    "Heather and bilberries\nDevonshire cream and convicts.",
    "Bring your wives gentlemen or bring the other thing\nEveryone welcome Scenery guaranteed.",
    "Walk up.",
    "Walk up.\u2019\nAt the last minute Rosamund Darnley came down looking concerned.",
    "She said \u2018Linda\u2019s not\ncoming.",
    "She says she\u2019s got a frightful headache.\u2019\nPoirot cried \u2018But it will do her good to come.",
    "Persuade her Mademoiselle.\u2019\nRosamund said firmly \u2018It\u2019s no good.",
    "She\u2019s absolutely determined.",
    "I\u2019ve given her some\naspirin and she\u2019s gone to bed.\u2019\nShe hesitated and said \u2018I think perhaps I won\u2019t go either.",
    "157\n\n\f\u2018Can\u2019t allow that dear lady can\u2019t allow that\u2019 cried Mr Blatt seizing her facetiously by the\narm.",
    "\u2018La haute Mode must grace the occasion.",
    "No refusals I\u2019ve taken you into custody ha\nha.",
    "Sentenced to Dartmoor.\u2019\nHe led her firmly to the first car.",
    "Rosamund threw a black look at Hercule Poirot.",
    "\u2018I\u2019ll stay with Linda\u2019 said Christine Redfern.",
    "\u2018I don\u2019t mind a bit.\u2019\nPatrick said \u2018Oh come on Christine.\u2019\nAnd Poirot said \u2018No no you must come Madame.",
    "With a headache one is better alone.",
    "Come let us start.\u2019\nThe three cars drove off.",
    "They went first to the real Pixy\u2019s Cave on Sheepstor and had a\ngood deal of fun looking for the entrance and at last finding it aided by a picture postcard.",
    "It was precarious going on the big boulders and Hercule Poirot did not attempt it.",
    "He\nwatched indulgently while Christine Redfern sprang lightly from stone to stone and\nobserved that her husband was never far from her.",
    "Rosamund Darnley and Emily Brewster\nhad joined in the search though the latter slipped once and gave a slight twist to her ankle.",
    "Stephen Lane was indefatigable his long lean figure turning and twisting among the\nboulders.",
    "Mr Blatt contented himself with going a little way and shouting encouragement\nalso taking photographs of the searchers.",
    "The Gardeners and Poirot remained staidly sitting by the wayside whilst Mrs Gardener\u2019s\nvoice upraised itself in a pleasant even\u2010toned monologue punctuated now and then by\nthe obedient \u2018Yes darlings\u2019 of her spouse.",
    "\u2018\u2014and what I always have felt M. Poirot and Mr Gardener agrees with me is that\nsnapshots can be very annoying.",
    "Unless that is to say they are taken among friends.",
    "That\nMr Blatt has just no sensitiveness of any kind.",
    "He just comes right up to everyone and talks\naway and takes pictures of you and as I said to Mr Gardener that really is very ill\u2010bred.",
    "That\u2019s what I said Odell wasn\u2019t it\u2019\n\u2018Yes darling.\u2019\n\u2018That group he took of us all sitting on the beach.",
    "Well that\u2019s all very well but he should\nhave asked first.",
    "As it was Miss Brewster was just getting up from the beach and it\ncertainly makes her look a very peculiar shape.\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019ll say it does\u2019 said Mr Gardener with a grin.",
    "\u2018And there\u2019s Mr Blatt giving round copies to everybody without so much as asking first.",
    "He\ngave one to you M. Poirot I noticed.\u2019\nPoirot nodded.",
    "He said \u2018I value that group very much.\u2019\n\n158\n\n\fMrs Gardener went on \u2018And look at his behaviour today\u2014so loud and noisy and common.",
    "Why it just makes me shudder.",
    "You ought to have arranged to leave that man at home\nM. Poirot.\u2019\nHercule Poirot murmured \u2018Alas Madame that would have been difficult.\u2019\n\u2018I should say it would.",
    "That man just pushes his way in anywhere.",
    "He\u2019s just not sensitive at\nall.\u2019\nAt this moment the discovery of the Pixy\u2019s Cave was hailed from below with loud cries.",
    "The party now drove on under Hercule Poirot\u2019s directions to a spot where a short walk\nfrom the car down a hillside of heather led to a delightful spot by a small river.",
    "A narrow plank bridge crossed the river and Poirot and her husband induced Mrs\nGardener to cross it to where a delightful heathery spot free from prickly furze looked an\nideal spot for a picnic lunch.",
    "Talking volubly about her sensations when crossing on a plank bridge Mrs Gardener sank\ndown.",
    "Suddenly there was a slight outcry.",
    "The others had run across the bridge lightly enough but Emily Brewster was standing in\nthe middle of the plank her eyes shut swaying to and fro.",
    "Poirot and Patrick Redfern rushed to the rescue.",
    "Emily Brewster was gruff and ashamed.",
    "\u2018Thanks thanks.",
    "Sorry.",
    "Never was good at crossing running water.",
    "Get giddy.",
    "Stupid very.\u2019\nLunch was spread out and the picnic began.",
    "All the people concerned were secretly surprised to find how much they enjoyed this\ninterlude.",
    "It was perhaps because it afforded an escape from an atmosphere of suspicion\nand dread.",
    "Here with the trickling of the water the soft peaty smell in the air and the\nwarm colouring of bracken and heather a world of murder and police inquiries and\nsuspicion seemed blotted out as though it had never existed.",
    "Even Mr Blatt forgot to be\nthe life and soul of the party.",
    "After lunch he went to sleep a little distance away and\nsubdued snores testified to his blissful unconsciousness.",
    "It was quite a grateful party of people who packed up the picnic baskets and congratulated\nHercule Poirot on his good idea.",
    "The sun was sinking as they returned along the narrow winding lanes.",
    "From the top of the\nhill above Leathercombe Bay they had a brief glimpse of the island with the white hotel on\nit.",
    "It looked peaceful and innocent in the setting sun.",
    "159\n\n\fMrs Gardener not loquacious for once sighed and said \u2018I really do thank you M. Poirot.",
    "I\nfeel so calm.",
    "It\u2019s just wonderful.\u2019\nII\nMajor Barry came out to greet them on arrival.",
    "\u2018Hullo\u2019 he said.",
    "\u2018Had a good day\u2019\nMrs Gardener said \u2018Indeed we did.",
    "The moors were just too lovely for anything.",
    "So English\nand old world.",
    "And the air delicious and invigorating.",
    "You ought to be ashamed of yourself\nfor being so lazy as to stay behind.\u2019\nThe Major chuckled.",
    "\u2018I\u2019m too old for that kind of thing\u2014sitting on a patch of bog and eating sandwiches.\u2019\nA chambermaid had come out of the hotel.",
    "She was a little out of breath.",
    "She hesitated for\na moment then came swiftly up to Christine Redfern.",
    "Hercule Poirot recognized her as Gladys Narracott.",
    "Her voice came quick and uneven.",
    "\u2018Excuse me Madam but I\u2019m worried about the young lady.",
    "About Miss Marshall.",
    "I took\nher up some tea just now and I couldn\u2019t get her to wake and she looks so\u2014so queer\nsomehow.\u2019\nChristine looked round helplessly.",
    "Poirot was at her side in a moment.",
    "His hand under her\nelbow he said quietly \u2018We will go up and see.\u2019\nThey hurried up the stairs and along the passage to Linda\u2019s room.",
    "One glance at her was enough to tell them both that something was very wrong.",
    "She was\nan odd colour and her breathing was hardly perceptible.",
    "Poirot\u2019s hand went to her pulse.",
    "At the same time he noticed an envelope stuck up against\nthe lamp on the bedside table.",
    "It was addressed to himself.",
    "Captain Marshall came quickly into the room.",
    "He said \u2018What\u2019s this about Linda What\u2019s\nthe matter with her\u2019\nA small frightened sob came from Christine Redfern.",
    "Hercule Poirot turned from the bed.",
    "He said to Marshall \u2018Get a doctor\u2014as quick as you\npossibly can.",
    "But I\u2019m afraid\u2014very much afraid\u2014it may be too late.\u2019\nHe took the letter with his name on it and ripped open the envelope.",
    "Inside were a few\nlines of writing in Linda\u2019s prim schoolgirl hand.",
    "160\n\n\fI think this is the best way out.",
    "Ask Father to try and forgive me.",
    "I killed Arlena.",
    "I\nthought I should be glad\u2014but I\u2019m not.",
    "I am very sorry for everything.",
    "III\nThey were assembled in the lounge\u2014Marshall the Redferns Rosamund Darnley and\nHercule Poirot.",
    "They sat there silent\u2014waiting...",
    "The door opened and Dr Neasden came in.",
    "He said curtly \u2018I\u2019ve done all I can.",
    "She may pull\nthrough\u2014but I\u2019m bound to tell you that there\u2019s not much hope.\u2019\nHe paused.",
    "Marshall his face stiff his eyes a cold frosty blue asked \u2018How did she get hold\nof the stuff\u2019\nNeasden opened the door again and beckoned.",
    "The chambermaid came into the room.",
    "She had been crying.",
    "Neasden said \u2018Just tell us again what you saw.\u2019\nSniffing the girl said \u2018I never thought\u2014I never thought for a minute there was anything\nwrong\u2014though the young lady did seem rather strange about it.\u2019 A slight gesture of\nimpatience from the doctor started her off again.",
    "\u2018She was in the other lady\u2019s room.",
    "Mrs\nRedfern\u2019s.",
    "Your room Madam.",
    "Over at the washstand and she took up a little bottle.",
    "She\ndid give a bit of a jump when I came in and I thought it was queer her taking things from\nyour room but then of course it might be something she\u2019d lent you.",
    "She just said \u201cOh\nthis is what I\u2019m looking for\u2014\u201d and went out.\u2019\nChristine said almost in a whisper.",
    "\u2018My sleeping tablets.\u2019\nThe doctor said brusquely \u2018How did she know about them\u2019\nChristine said \u2018I gave her one.",
    "The night after it happened.",
    "She told me she couldn\u2019t sleep.",
    "She\u2014I remember her saying\u2014\u201cWill one be enough\u201d\u2014and I said Oh yes they were very\nstrong\u2014that I\u2019d been cautioned never to take more than two at most.\u2019\nNeasden nodded \u2018She made pretty sure\u2019 he said.",
    "\u2018Took six of them.\u2019\nChristine sobbed again.",
    "\u2018Oh dear I feel it\u2019s my fault.",
    "I should have kept them locked up.\u2019\nThe doctor shrugged his shoulders.",
    "161\n\n\f\u2018It might have been wiser Mrs Redfern.\u2019\nChristine said despairingly \u2018She\u2019s dying\u2014and it\u2019s my fault...\u2019\nKenneth Marshall stirred in his chair.",
    "He said \u2018No you can\u2019t blame yourself.",
    "Linda knew\nwhat she was doing.",
    "She took them deliberately.",
    "Perhaps\u2014perhaps it was best.\u2019\nHe looked down at the crumpled note in his hand\u2014the note that Poirot had silently\nhanded to him.",
    "Rosamund Darnley cried out.",
    "\u2018I don\u2019t believe it.",
    "I don\u2019t believe Linda killed her.",
    "Surely it\u2019s impossible\u2014on the evidence\u2019\nChristine said eagerly \u2018Yes she can\u2019t have done it She must have got overwrought and\nimagined it all.\u2019\nThe door opened and Colonel Weston came in.",
    "He said \u2018What\u2019s all this I hear\u2019\nDr Neasden took the note from Marshall\u2019s hand and handed it to the Chief Constable.",
    "The\nlatter read it.",
    "He exclaimed incredulously \u2018What But this is nonsense\u2014absolute\nnonsense It\u2019s impossible.\u2019 He repeated with assurance.",
    "\u2018Impossible Isn\u2019t it Poirot\u2019\nHercule Poirot moved for the first time.",
    "He said in a slow sad voice \u2018No I\u2019m afraid it is not\nimpossible.\u2019\nChristine Redfern said \u2018But I was with her M. Poirot.",
    "I was with her up to a quarter to\ntwelve.",
    "I told the police so.\u2019\nPoirot said \u2018Your evidence gave her an alibi\u2014yes.",
    "But what was your evidence based on\nIt was based on Linda Marshall\u2019s own wristwatch.",
    "You do not know of your own\nknowledge that it was a quarter to twelve when you left her\u2014you only know that she told\nyou so.",
    "You said yourself the time seemed to have gone very fast.\u2019\nShe stared at him stricken.",
    "He said \u2018Now think Madame when you left the beach did you walk back to the hotel\nfast or slow\u2019\n\u2018I\u2014well fairly slowly I think.\u2019\n\u2018Do you remember much about that walk back\u2019\n\u2018Not very much I\u2019m afraid.",
    "I\u2014I was thinking.\u2019\nPoirot said \u2018I am sorry to ask you this but will you tell just what you were thinking about\nduring that walk\u2019\n162\n\n\fChristine flushed.",
    "\u2018I suppose\u2014if it is necessary...",
    "I was considering the question of\u2014of leaving here.",
    "Just\ngoing away without telling my husband.",
    "I\u2014I was very unhappy just then you see.\u2019\nPatrick Redfern cried \u2018Oh Christine I know...",
    "I know...\u2019\nPoirot\u2019s precise voice cut in.",
    "\u2018Exactly.",
    "You were concerned over taking a step of some importance.",
    "You were I should\nsay deaf and blind to your surroundings.",
    "You probably walked very slowly and\noccasionally stopped for some minutes whilst you puzzled things out.\u2019\nChristine nodded.",
    "\u2018How clever you are.",
    "It was just like that.",
    "I woke up from a kind of dream just outside the\nhotel and hurried in thinking I should be very late but when I saw the clock in the lounge I\nrealized I had plenty of time.\u2019\nHercule Poirot said again \u2018Exactly.\u2019\nHe turned to Marshall.",
    "\u2018I must now describe to you certain things I found in your daughter\u2019s room after the\nmurder.",
    "In the grate was a large blob of melted wax some burnt hair fragments of\ncardboard and paper and an ordinary household pin.",
    "The paper and the cardboard might\nnot be relevant but the other three things were suggestive\u2014particularly when I found\ntucked away in the bookshelf a volume from the local library here dealing with witchcraft\nand magic.",
    "It opened very easily at a certain page.",
    "On that page were described various\nmethods of causing death by moulding in wax a figure supposed to represent the victim.",
    "This was then slowly roasted till it melted away\u2014or alternatively you would pierce the\nwax figure to the heart with a pin.",
    "Death of the victim would ensue.",
    "I later heard from Mrs\nRedfern that Linda Marshall had been out early that morning and had bought a packet of\ncandles and had seemed embarrassed when her purchase was revealed.",
    "I had no doubt\nwhat had happened after that.",
    "Linda had made a crude figure of the candle wax\u2014possibly\nadorning it with a snip of Arlena\u2019s red hair to give the magic force\u2014had then stabbed it to\nthe heart with a pin and finally melted the figure away by lighting strips of cardboard\nunder it.\u2019\n\u2018It was crude childish superstitious but it revealed one thing the desire to kill.\u2019\n\u2018Was there any possibility that there had been more than a desire Could Linda Marshall\nhave actually killed her stepmother\u2019\n\u2018At first sight it seemed as though she had a perfect alibi\u2014but in actuality as I have just\npointed out the time evidence was supplied by Linda herself.",
    "She could easily have\ndeclared the time to be a quarter of an hour later than it really was.\u2019\n163\n\n\f\u2018It was quite possible once Mrs Redfern had left the beach for Linda to follow her up and\nthen strike across the narrow neck of land to the ladder hurry down it meet her\nstepmother there strangle her and return up the ladder before the boat containing Miss\nBrewster and Patrick Redfern came in sight.",
    "She could then return to Gull Cove take her\nbathe and return to the hotel at her leisure.\u2019\n\u2018But that entailed two things.",
    "She must have definite knowledge that Arlena Marshall\nwould be at Pixy Cove and she must be physically capable of the deed.\u2019\n\u2018Well the first was quite possible\u2014if Linda Marshall had written a note to Arlena herself in\nsomeone else\u2019s name.",
    "As to the second Linda has very large strong hands.",
    "They are as\nlarge as a man\u2019s.",
    "As to the strength she is at the age when one is prone to be mentally\nunbalanced.",
    "Mental derangement often is accompanied by unusual strength.",
    "There was\none other small point.",
    "Linda Marshall\u2019s mother had actually been accused and tried for\nmurder.\u2019\nKenneth Marshall lifted his head.",
    "He said fiercely \u2018She was also acquitted.\u2019\n\u2018She was acquitted\u2019 Poirot agreed.",
    "Marshall said \u2018And I\u2019ll tell you this M. Poirot.",
    "Ruth\u2014my wife\u2014was innocent.",
    "That I know\nwith complete and absolute certainty.",
    "In the intimacy of our life I could not have been\ndeceived.",
    "She was an innocent victim of circumstances.\u2019\nHe paused.",
    "\u2018And I don\u2019t believe that Linda killed Arlena.",
    "It\u2019s ridiculous\u2014absurd\u2019\nPoirot said \u2018Do you believe that letter then to be a forgery\u2019\nMarshall held out his hand for it and Weston gave it to him.",
    "Marshall studied it attentively.",
    "Then he shook his head.",
    "\u2018No\u2019 he said unwillingly.",
    "\u2018I believe Linda did write this.\u2019\nPoirot said \u2018Then if she wrote it there are only two explanations.",
    "Either she wrote it in all\ngood faith knowing herself to be the murderess or\u2014or I say\u2014she wrote it deliberately to\nshield someone else someone whom she feared was suspected.\u2019\nKenneth Marshall said \u2018You mean me\u2019\n\u2018It is possible is it not\u2019\nMarshall considered for a moment or two then he said quietly \u2018No I think that idea is\nabsurd.",
    "Linda may have realized that I was regarded with suspicion at first.",
    "But she knew\ndefinitely by now that that was over and done with\u2014that the police had accepted my alibi\nand turned their attention elsewhere.\u2019\n164\n\n\fPoirot said \u2018And supposing that it was not so much that she thought that you were\nsuspected as that she knew you were guilty.\u2019\nMarshall stared at him.",
    "He gave a short laugh.",
    "\u2018That\u2019s absurd.\u2019\nPoirot said \u2018I wonder.",
    "There are you know several possibilities about Mrs Marshall\u2019s\ndeath.",
    "There is the theory that she was being blackmailed that she went that morning to\nmeet the blackmailer and that the blackmailer killed her.",
    "There is the theory that Pixy\nCove and Cave were being used for drug\u2010running and that she was killed because she\naccidentally learned something about that.",
    "There is a third possibility\u2014that she was killed\nby a religious maniac.",
    "And there is a fourth possibility\u2014you stood to gain a lot of money\nby your wife\u2019s death Captain Marshall\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019ve just told you\u2014\u2019\n\u2018Yes yes\u2014I agree that it is impossible that you could have killed your wife\u2014if you were\nacting alone.",
    "But supposing someone helped you\u2019\n\u2018What the devil do you mean\u2019\nThe quiet man was roused at last.",
    "He half rose from his chair.",
    "His voice was menacing.",
    "There was a hard angry light in his eyes.",
    "Poirot said \u2018I mean that this is not a crime that was committed single\u2010handed.",
    "Two people\nwere in it.",
    "It is quite true that you could not have typed that letter and at the same time\ngone to the cove\u2014but there would have been time for you to have jotted down that letter\nin shorthand\u2014and for someone else to have typed it in your room while you yourself\nwere absent on your murderous errand.\u2019\nHercule Poirot looked towards Rosamund Darnley.",
    "He said \u2018Miss Darnley states that she\nleft Sunny Ledge at ten minutes past eleven and saw you typing in your room.",
    "But just\nabout that time Mr Gardener went up to the hotel to fetch a skein of wool for his wife.",
    "He\ndid not meet Miss Darnley or see her.",
    "That is rather remarkable.",
    "It looks as though either\nMiss Darnley never left Sunny Ledge or else she had left it much earlier and was in your\nroom typing industriously.",
    "Another point you stated that when Miss Darnley looked into\nyour room at a quarter past eleven you saw her in the mirror.",
    "But on the day of the\nmurder your typewriter and papers were all on the writing\u2010desk across the corner of the\nroom whereas the mirror was between the windows.",
    "So that statement was a deliberate\nlie.",
    "Later you moved your typewriter to the table under the mirror so as to substantiate\nyour story\u2014but it was too late.",
    "I was aware that both you and Miss Darnley had lied.\u2019\nRosamund Darnley spoke.",
    "Her voice was low and clear.",
    "She said \u2018How devilishly ingenious you are\u2019\n\n165\n\n\fHercule Poirot said raising his voice \u2018But not so devilish and so ingenious as the man who\nkilled Arlena Marshall Think back for a moment.",
    "Who did I think\u2014who did everybody\nthink\u2014that Arlena Marshall had gone to meet that morning We all jumped to the same\nconclusion.",
    "Patrick Redfern.",
    "It was not to meet a blackmailer that she went.",
    "Her face alone\nwould have told me that.",
    "Oh no it was a lover she was going to meet\u2014or thought she was\ngoing to meet.",
    "\u2018Yes I was quite sure of that.",
    "Arlena Marshall was going to meet Patrick Redfern.",
    "But a\nminute later Patrick Redfern appeared on the beach and was obviously looking for her.",
    "So\nwhat then\u2019\nPatrick Redfern said with subdued anger \u2018Some devil used my name.\u2019\nPoirot said \u2018You were very obviously upset and surprised by her non\u2010appearance.",
    "Almost\ntoo obviously perhaps.",
    "It is my theory Mr Redfern that she went to Pixy Cove to meet\nyou and that she did meet you and that you killed her there as you had planned to do.\u2019\nPatrick Redfern stared.",
    "He said in his high good\u2010humoured Irish voice \u2018Is it daft you are I\nwas with you on the beach until I went round in the boat with Miss Brewster and found\nher dead.\u2019\nHercule Poirot said \u2018You killed her after Miss Brewster had gone off in the boat to fetch\nthe police.",
    "Arlena Marshall was not dead when you got to the beach.",
    "She was waiting\nhidden in the cave until the coast could be clear.\u2019\n\u2018But the body Miss Brewster and I both saw the body.\u2019\n\u2018A body\u2014yes.",
    "But not a dead body.",
    "The live body of the woman who helped you her arms\nand legs stained with tan her face hidden by a green cardboard hat.",
    "Christine your wife\nor possibly not your wife\u2014but still your partner helping you to commit this crime as she\nhelped you to commit that crime in the past when she \u2018discovered\u2019 the body of Alice\nCorrigan at least twenty minutes before Alice Corrigan died\u2014killed by her husband\nEdward Corrigan\u2014you\u2019\nChristine spoke.",
    "Her voice was sharp\u2014cold.",
    "She said \u2018Be careful Patrick don\u2019t lose your\ntemper.\u2019\nPoirot said \u2018You will be interested to hear that both you and your wife Christine were\neasily recognized and picked out by the Surrey police from a group of people\nphotographed here.",
    "They identified you both at once as Edward Corrigan and Christine\nDeverill the young woman who found the body.\u2019\nPatrick Redfern had risen.",
    "His handsome face was transformed suffused with blood blind\nwith rage.",
    "It was the face of a killer\u2014of a tiger.",
    "He yelled \u2018You damned interfering\nmurdering lousy little worm\u2019\nHe hurled himself forward his fingers stretching and curling his voice raving curses as he\nfastened his fingers round Hercule Poirot\u2019s throat...\n166\n\n\f167\n\n\fChapter 13\nPoirot said reflectively \u2018It was on a morning when we were sitting out here that we talked\nof sun\u2010tanned bodies lying like meat upon a slab and it was then that I reflected how little\ndifference there was between one body and another.",
    "If one looked closely and\nappraisingly\u2014yes\u2014but to the casual glance One moderately well\u2010made young woman is\nvery like another.",
    "Two brown legs two brown arms a little piece of bathing suit in\nbetween\u2014just a body lying out in the sun.",
    "When a woman walks when she speaks\nlaughs turns her head moves a hand\u2014then yes then there is personality\u2014individuality.",
    "But in the sun ritual\u2014no.\u2019\n\u2018It was that day that we spoke of evil\u2014evil under the sun as Mr Lane put it.",
    "Mr Lane is a\nvery sensitive person\u2014evil affects him\u2014he perceives its presence\u2014but though he is a\ngood recording instrument he did not really know exactly where the evil was.",
    "To him evil\nwas focused in the person of Arlena Marshall and practically everyone present agreed\nwith him.\u2019\n\u2018But to my mind though evil was present it was not centralized in Arlena Marshall at all.",
    "It\nwas connected with her yes\u2014but in a totally different way.",
    "I saw her first last and all the\ntime as an eternal and predestined victim.",
    "Because she was beautiful because she had\nglamour because men turned their heads to look at her it was assumed that she was the\ntype of woman who wrecked lives and destroyed souls.",
    "But I saw her very differently.",
    "It\nwas not she who fatally attracted men\u2014it was men who fatally attracted her.",
    "She was the\ntype of woman whom men care for easily and of whom they as easily tire.",
    "And everything\nthat I was told or found out about her strengthened my conviction on this point.",
    "The first\nthing that was mentioned about her was how the man in whose divorce case she had\nbeen cited refused to marry her.",
    "It was then that Captain Marshall one of those incurably\nchivalrous men stepped in and asked her to marry him.",
    "To a shy retiring man of Captain\nMarshall\u2019s type a public ordeal of any kind would be the worst torture\u2014hence his love\nand pity for his first wife who was publicly accused and tried for a murder she had not\ncommitted.",
    "He married her and found himself amply justified in his estimate of her\ncharacter.",
    "After her death another beautiful woman perhaps something of the same type\nsince Linda has red hair which she probably inherited from her mother is held up to\npublic ignominy.",
    "Again Marshall performs a rescue act.",
    "But this time he finds little to\nsustain his infatuation.",
    "Arlena is stupid unworthy of his sympathy and protection\nmindless.",
    "Nevertheless I think he always had a fairly true vision of her.",
    "Long after he\nceased to love her and was irked by her presence he remained sorry for her.",
    "She was to\nhim like a child who cannot get farther than a certain page in the book of life.\u2019\n\u2018I saw in Arlena Marshall with her passion for men a predestined prey for an unscrupulous\nman of a certain type.",
    "In Patrick Redfern with his good looks his easy assurance his\nundeniable charm for women I recognized at once that type.",
    "The adventurer who makes\nhis living one way or another out of women.",
    "Looking on from my place on the beach I\nwas quite certain that Arlena was Patrick\u2019s victim not the other way about.",
    "And I\nassociated that focus of evil with Patrick Redfern not with Arlena Marshall.\u2019\n\u2018Arlena had recently come into a large sum of money left her by an elderly admirer who\nhad not had time to grow tired of her.",
    "She was the type of woman who is invariably\n168\n\n\fdefrauded of money by some man or other.",
    "Miss Brewster mentioned a young man who\nhad been \u201cruined\u201d by Arlena but a letter from him which was found in her room though\nit expressed a wish which cost nothing to cover her with jewels in actual fact\nacknowledged a cheque from her by means of which he hoped to escape prosecution.",
    "A\nclear case of a young waster sponging on her.",
    "I have no doubt that Patrick Redfern found\nit easy to induce her to hand him large sums from time to time \u201cfor investment\u201d.",
    "He\nprobably dazzled her with stories of great opportunities\u2014how he would make her fortune\nand his own.",
    "Unprotected women living alone are easy prey to that type of man\u2014and he\nusually escapes scot free with the booty.",
    "If however there is a husband or a brother or a\nfather about things are apt to take an unpleasant turn for the swindler.",
    "Once Captain\nMarshall was to find out what had happened to his wife\u2019s fortune Patrick Redfern might\nexpect short shrift.\u2019\n\u2018That did not worry him however because he contemplated quite calmly doing away with\nher when he judged it necessary\u2014encouraged by having already got away with one\nmurder\u2014that of a young woman whom he had married in the name of Corrigan and\nwhom he had persuaded to insure her life for a large sum.\u2019\n\u2018In his plans he was aided and abetted by the woman who down here passed as his wife\nand to whom he was genuinely attached.",
    "A young woman as unlike the type of his victims\nas could well be imagined\u2014cool calm passionless but steadfastly loyal to him and an\nactress of no mean ability.",
    "From the time of her arrival here Christine Redfern played a\npart the part of the \u201cpoor little wife\u201d\u2014frail helpless intellectual rather than athletic.",
    "Think of the points she made one after another.",
    "Her tendency to blister in the sun and her\nconsequent white skin her giddiness at heights\u2014stories of getting stuck on Milan\nCathedral etc.",
    "An emphasis on her frailty and delicacy\u2014nearly every one spoke of her as a\n\u201clittle woman\u201d.",
    "She was actually as tall as Arlena Marshall but with very small hands and\nfeet.",
    "She spoke of herself as a former school\u2010teacher and thereby emphasized an\nimpression of book learning and lack of athletic prowess.",
    "Actually it is quite true that she\nhad worked in a school but the position she held there was that of games mistress and\nshe was an extremely active young woman who could climb like a cat and run like an\nathlete.\u2019\n\u2018The crime itself was perfectly planned and timed.",
    "It was as I mentioned before a very\nslick crime.",
    "The timing was a work of genius.\u2019\n\u2018First of all there were certain preliminary scenes\u2014one played on the cliff ledge when they\nknew me to be occupying the next recess\u2014a conventional jealous wife dialogue between\nher and her husband.",
    "Later she played the same part in a scene with me.",
    "At the time I\nremember a vague feeling of having read all this in a book.",
    "It did not seem real.",
    "Because\nof course it was not real.",
    "Then came the day of the crime.",
    "It was a fine day\u2014an essential.",
    "Redfern\u2019s first act was to slip out very early\u2014by the balcony door which he unlocked from\nthe inside if found open it would only be thought someone had gone for an early bathe.",
    "Under his bathing\u2010wrap he concealed a green Chinese hat the duplicate of the one Arlena\nwas in the habit of wearing.",
    "He slipped across the island down the ladder and stowed it\naway in an appointed place behind some rocks.",
    "Part I.\u2019\n\u2018On the previous evening he had arranged a rendezvous with Arlena.",
    "They were exercising\na good deal of caution about meeting as Arlena was slightly afraid of her husband.",
    "She\n169\n\n\fagreed to go round to Pixy Cove early.",
    "Nobody went there in the morning.",
    "Redfern was to\njoin her there taking a chance to slip away unobtrusively.",
    "If she heard anyone descending\nthe ladder or a boat came in sight she was to slip inside the Pixy\u2019s Cave the secret of\nwhich he had told her and wait there until the coast was clear.",
    "Part II.\u2019\n\u2018In the meantime Christine went to Linda\u2019s room at a time when she judged Linda would\nhave gone for her early morning dip.",
    "She would then alter Linda\u2019s watch putting it on\ntwenty minutes.",
    "There was of course a risk that Linda might notice her watch was wrong\nbut it did not much matter if she did.",
    "Christine\u2019s real alibi was the size of her hands which\nmade it a physical impossibility for her to have committed the crime.",
    "Nevertheless an\nadditional alibi would be desirable.",
    "Then in Linda\u2019s room she noticed the book on\nwitchcraft and magic open at a certain page.",
    "She read it and when Linda came in and\ndropped a parcel of candles she realized what was in Linda\u2019s mind.",
    "It opened up some new\nideas to her.",
    "The original idea of the guilty pair had been to cast a reasonable amount of\nsuspicion on Kenneth Marshall hence the abstracted pipe a fragment of which was to be\nplanted on the Cove underneath the ladder.\u2019\n\u2018On Linda\u2019s return Christine easily arranged an outing together to Gull Cove.",
    "She then\nreturned to her own room took out from a locked suitcase a bottle of artificial suntan\napplied it carefully and threw the empty bottle out of the window where it narrowly\nescaped hitting Emily Brewster who was bathing.",
    "Part II successfully accomplished.\u2019\n\u2018Christine then dressed herself in a white bathing\u2010suit and over it a pair of beach trousers\nand coat with long floppy sleeves which effectually concealed her newly\u2010browned arms\nand legs.\u2019\n\u2018At 10.15 Arlena departed for her rendezvous a minute or two later Patrick Redfern came\ndown and registered surprise annoyance etc.",
    "Christine\u2019s task was easy enough.",
    "Keeping\nher own watch concealed she asked Linda at twenty\u2010five past eleven what time it was.",
    "Linda looked at her watch and replied that it was a quarter to twelve.",
    "She then starts\ndown to the sea and Christine packs up her sketching things.",
    "As soon as Linda\u2019s back is\nturned Christine picks up the girl\u2019s watch which she has necessarily discarded before going\ninto the sea and alters it back to the correct time.",
    "Then she hurries up the cliff path runs\nacross the narrow neck of land to the top of the ladder strips off her pyjamas and shoves\nthem and her sketching box behind a rock and swarms rapidly down the ladder in her best\ngymnastic fashion.\u2019\n\u2018Arlena is on the beach below wondering why Patrick is so long in coming.",
    "She sees or\nhears someone on the ladder takes a cautious observation and to her annoyance sees\nthat inconvenient person\u2014the wife She hurries along the beach and into the Pixy\u2019s Cave.\u2019\n\u2018Christine takes the hat from its hiding\u2010place a false red curl pinned underneath the brim\nat the back and disposes herself in a sprawling attitude with the hat and curl shielding her\nface and neck.",
    "The timing is perfect.",
    "A minute or two later the boat containing Patrick and\nEmily Brewster comes round the point.",
    "Remember it is Patrick who bends down and\nexamines the body Patrick who is stunned\u2014shocked\u2014broken down by the death of his\nlady love His witness has been carefully chosen.",
    "Miss Brewster has not got a good head\nshe will not attempt to go up the ladder.",
    "She will leave the Cove by boat Patrick naturally\n170\n\n\fbeing the one to remain with the body\u2014\u201cin case the murderer may still be about\u201d.",
    "Miss\nBrewster rows off to fetch the police.",
    "Christine as soon as the boat has disappeared\nsprings up cuts the hat into pieces with the scissors Patrick has carefully brought stuffs\nthem into her bathing\u2010suit and swarms up the ladder in double quick time slips into her\nbeach\u2010pyjamas and runs back to the hotel.",
    "Just time to have a quick bath washing off the\nbrown suntan application and into her tennis dress.",
    "One other thing she does.",
    "She burns\nthe pieces of the green cardboard hat and the hair in Linda\u2019s grate adding a leaf of a\ncalendar so that it may be associated with the cardboard.",
    "Not a Hat but a Calendar has\nbeen burnt.",
    "As she suspected Linda has been experimenting in magic\u2014the blob of wax\nand the pin shows that.\u2019\n\u2018Then down to the tennis court arriving the last but showing no signs of flurry or haste.\u2019\n\u2018And meanwhile Patrick has gone to the cave.",
    "Arlena has seen nothing and heard very\nlittle\u2014a boat\u2014voices\u2014she has prudently remained hidden.",
    "But now it is Patrick calling.\u2019\n\u2018\u201cAll clear darling\u201d and she comes out and his hands fasten round her neck\u2014and that is\nthe end of poor foolish beautiful Arlena Marshall...\u2019\nHis voice died away.",
    "For a moment there was silence then Rosamund Darnley said with a little shiver \u2018Yes you\nmake one see it all.",
    "But that\u2019s the story from the other side.",
    "You haven\u2019t told us how you\ncame to get at the truth\u2019\nHercule Poirot said \u2018I told you once that I had a very simple mind.",
    "Always from the\nbeginning it seemed to me that the most likely person had killed Arlena Marshall.",
    "And the\nmost likely person was Patrick Redfern.",
    "He was the type par excellence\u2014the type of man\nwho exploits women like her\u2014and the type of the killer\u2014the kind of man who will take a\nwoman\u2019s savings and cut her throat into the bargain.",
    "Who was Arlena going to meet that\nmorning By the evidence of her face her smile her manner her words to me\u2014Patrick\nRedfern.",
    "And therefore in the very nature of things it should be Patrick who killed her.\u2019\n\u2018But at once I came up as I told you against impossibility.",
    "Patrick Redfern could not have\nkilled her since he was on the beach and in Miss Brewster\u2019s company until the actual\ndiscovery of the body.",
    "So I looked about for other solutions\u2014and there were several.",
    "She\ncould have been killed by her husband\u2014with Miss Darnley\u2019s connivance.",
    "They too had\nboth lied as to one point which looked suspicious.",
    "She could have been killed as a result\nof her having stumbled on the secret of the dope smuggling.",
    "She could have been killed as\nI said by a religious maniac and she could have been killed by her stepdaughter.",
    "The\nlatter seemed to me at one time to be the real solution.",
    "Linda\u2019s manner in her very first\nintervew with the police was significant.",
    "An interview that I had with her later assured me\nof one point.",
    "Linda considered herself guilty.\u2019\n\u2018You mean she imagined that she had actually killed Arlena\u2019\nRosamund\u2019s voice was incredulous.",
    "171\n\n\fHercule Poirot nodded.",
    "\u2018Yes.",
    "Remember\u2014she is really little more than a child.",
    "She read that book on witchcraft\nand she half believed it.",
    "She hated Arlena.",
    "She deliberately made the wax doll cast her\nspell pierced it to the heart melted it away\u2014and that very day Arlena dies.",
    "Older and\nwiser people than Linda have believed fervently in magic.",
    "Naturally she believed that it\nwas all true\u2014that by using magic she had killed her stepmother.\u2019\nRosamund cried \u2018Oh poor child poor child.",
    "And I thought\u2014I imagined\u2014something quite\ndifferent\u2014that she knew something which would\u2014\u2019\nRosamund stopped.",
    "Poirot said \u2018I know what it was you thought.",
    "Actually your manner frightened Linda still\nfurther.",
    "She believed that her action had really brought about Arlena\u2019s death and that you\nknew it.",
    "Christine Redfern worked on her too introducing the idea of the sleeping tablets\nto her mind showing her the way to a speedy and painless expiation of her crime.",
    "You\nsee once Captain Marshall was proved to have an alibi it was vital for a new suspect to be\nfound.",
    "Neither she nor her husband knew about the dope smuggling.",
    "They fixed on Linda\nto be the scapegoat.\u2019\nRosamund said \u2018What a devil\u2019\nPoirot nodded.",
    "\u2018Yes you are right.",
    "A cold\u2010blooded and cruel woman.",
    "For me I was in great difficulty.",
    "Was\nLinda guilty only of the childish attempt at witchcraft or had her hate carried her still\nfurther\u2014to the actual act I tried to get her to confess to me.",
    "But it was no good.",
    "At that\nmoment I was in grave uncertainty.",
    "The Chief Constable was inclined to accept the dope\nsmuggling explanation.",
    "I couldn\u2019t let it go at that.",
    "I went over the facts again very carefully.",
    "I had you see a collection of jig\u2010saw puzzle pieces isolated happenings\u2014plain facts.",
    "The\nwhole must fit into a complete and harmonious pattern.",
    "There were the scissors found on\nthe beach\u2014a bottle thrown from a window\u2014a bath that no one would admit to having\ntaken\u2014all perfectly harmless occurrences in themselves but rendered significant by the\nfact that no one would admit to them.",
    "Therefore they must be of significance.",
    "Nothing\nabout them fitted in with the theories of either Captain Marshall\u2019s or Linda\u2019s or of a dope\ngang\u2019s being responsible.",
    "And yet they must have meaning.",
    "I went back again to my first\nsolution\u2014that Patrick Redfern had committed the murder.",
    "Was there anything in support\nof that Yes the fact that a very large sum of money was missing from Arlena\u2019s account.",
    "Who had got that money Patrick Redfern of course.",
    "She was the type of woman easily\nswindled by a handsome young man\u2014but she was not at all the type of woman to be\nblackmailed.",
    "She was far too transparent not good enough at keeping a secret.",
    "The\nblackmailer story had never rung true to my mind.",
    "And yet there had been that\nconversation overheard\u2014ah but overheard by whom Patrick Redfern\u2019s wife.",
    "It was her\nstory\u2014unsupported by any outside evidence.",
    "Why was it invented The answer came to\nme like lightning.",
    "To account for the absence of Arlena\u2019s money\u2019\n\n172\n\n\f\u2018Patrick and Christine Redfern.",
    "The two of them were in it together.",
    "Christine hadn\u2019t got\nthe physical strength to strangle her or the mental make up.",
    "No it was Patrick who had\ndone it\u2014but that was impossible Every minute of his time was accounted for until the\nbody was found.\u2019\n\u2018Body\u2014the word stirred something in my mind\u2014bodies lying on the beach\u2014all alike.",
    "Patrick Redfern and Emily Brewster had got to the Cove and seen a body lying there.",
    "A\nbody\u2014suppose it was not Arlena\u2019s body but somebody else\u2019s The face was hidden by the\ngreat Chinese hat.\u2019\n\u2018But there was only one dead body\u2014Arlena\u2019s.",
    "Then could it be\u2014a live body\u2014someone\npretending to be dead Could it be Arlena herself inspired by Patrick to play some kind of\na joke.",
    "I shook my head\u2014no too risky.",
    "A live body\u2014whose Was there any woman who\nwould help Redfern Of course\u2014his wife.",
    "But she was a white\u2010skinned delicate creature.",
    "Ah yes but suntan can be applied out of bottles\u2014bottles\u2014I had one of my jig\u2010saw pieces.",
    "Yes and afterwards of course a bath\u2014to wash that tell\u2010tale stain off before she went out\nto play tennis.",
    "And the scissors Why to cut up that duplicate cardboard hat\u2014an\nunwieldy thing that must be got out of the way and in the haste the scissors were left\nbehind\u2014the one thing that the pair of murderers forgot.\u2019\n\u2018But where was Arlena all the time That again was perfectly clear.",
    "Either Rosamund\nDarnley or Arlena Marshall had been in the Pixy\u2019s Cave the scent they both used told me\nthat.",
    "It was certainly not Rosamund Darnley.",
    "Then it was Arlena hiding till the coast\nshould clear.\u2019\n\u2018When Emily Brewster went off in the boat Patrick had the beach to himself and full\nopportunity to commit the crime.",
    "Arlena Marshall was killed after a quarter to twelve but\nthe medical evidence was only concerned with the earliest possible time the crime could\nhave been committed.",
    "That Arlena was dead at a quarter to twelve was what was told to\nthe doctor not what he told the police.\u2019\n\u2018Two more points had to be settled.",
    "Linda Marshall\u2019s evidence gave Christine Redfern an\nalibi.",
    "Yes but that evidence depended on Linda Marshall\u2019s wristwatch.",
    "All that was needed\nwas to prove that Christine had had two opportunities of tampering with the watch.",
    "I\nfound those easily enough.",
    "She had been alone in Linda\u2019s room that morning\u2014and there\nwas an indirect proof.",
    "Linda was heard to say that she was \u201cafraid she was going to be\nlate\u201d but when she got down it was only twenty\u2010five past ten by the lounge clock.",
    "The\nsecond opportunity was easy\u2014she could alter the watch back again as soon as Linda\nturned her back and went down to bathe.\u2019\n\u2018Then there was the question of the ladder.",
    "Christine had always declared she had no head\nfor heights.",
    "Another carefully prepared lie.\u2019\n\u2018I had my mosaic now\u2014each piece beautifully fitted into its place.",
    "But unfortunately I\nhad no definite proof.",
    "It was all in my mind.\u2019\n\u2018It was then that an idea came to me.",
    "There was an assurance\u2014a slickness about the\ncrime.",
    "I had no doubt that in the future Patrick Redfern would repeat his crime.",
    "What\n173\n\n\fabout the past It was remotely possible that this was not his first killing.",
    "The method\nemployed strangulation was in harmony with his nature\u2014a killer for pleasure as well as\nfor profit.",
    "If he was already a murderer I was sure that he would have used the same\nmeans.",
    "I asked Inspector Colgate for a list of women victims of strangulation.",
    "The result\nfilled me with joy.",
    "The death of Nellie Parson found strangled in a lonely copse might or\nmight not be Patrick Redfern\u2019s work\u2014it might merely have suggested choice of locality to\nhim but in Alice Corrigan\u2019s death I found exactly what I was looking for.",
    "In essence the\nsame method.",
    "Juggling with time\u2014a murder committed not as is the usual way before it\nis supposed to have happened but afterwards.",
    "A body supposedly discovered at a quarter\npast four.",
    "A husband with an alibi up to twenty\u2010five past four.\u2019\n\u2018What really happened It was said that Edward Corrigan arrived at the Pine Ridge found\nhis wife not there and went out and walked up and down.",
    "Actually of course he ran full\nspeed to the rendezvous Caesar\u2019s Grove which you will remember was quite nearby\nkilled her and returned to the caf\u00e9.",
    "The girl hiker who reported the crime was a most\nrespectable young lady games mistress in a well\u2010known girls\u2019 school.",
    "Apparently she had\nno connection with Edward Corrigan.",
    "She had to walk some way to report the death.",
    "The\npolice surgeon only examined the body at a quarter to six.",
    "As in this case the time of death\nwas accepted without question.\u2019\n\u2018I made one final test.",
    "I must know definitely if Mrs Redfern was a liar.",
    "I arranged our little\nexcursion to Dartmoor.",
    "If anyone has a bad head for heights they are never comfortable\ncrossing a narrow bridge over running water.",
    "Miss Brewster a genuine sufferer showed\ngiddiness.",
    "But Christine Redfern unconcerned ran across without a qualm.",
    "It was a small\npoint but it was a definite test.",
    "If she had told one unnecessary lie\u2014then all the other lies\nwere possible.",
    "In the meantime Colgate had got the photograph identified by the Surrey\nPolice.",
    "I played my hand in the only way I thought likely to succeed.",
    "Having lulled Patrick\nRedfern into security I turned on him and did my utmost to make him lose his self\u2010control.",
    "The knowledge that he had been identified with Corrigan caused him to lose his head\ncompletely.\u2019\nHercule Poirot stroked his throat reminiscently.",
    "\u2018What I did\u2019 he said with importance \u2018was exceedingly dangerous\u2014but I do not regret it.",
    "I\nsucceeded I did not suffer in vain.\u2019\nThere was a moment\u2019s silence.",
    "Then Mrs Gardener gave a deep sigh.",
    "\u2018Why M. Poirot\u2019 she said.",
    "\u2018It\u2019s just been too wonderful\u2014hearing just exactly how you got\nyour results.",
    "It\u2019s every bit as fascinating as a lecture on criminology\u2014in fact it is a lecture\non criminology.",
    "And to think my magenta wool and that sun\u2010bathing conversation actually\nhad something to do with it That really makes me too excited for words and I\u2019m sure Mr\nGardener feels the same don\u2019t you Odell\u2019\n\u2018Yes darling\u2019 said Mr Gardener.",
    "Hercule Poirot said \u2018Mr Gardener too was of assistance to me.",
    "I wanted the opinion of a\nsensible man about Mrs Marshall.",
    "I asked Mr Gardener what he thought of her.\u2019\n174\n\n\f\u2018Is that so\u2019 said Mrs Gardener.",
    "\u2018And what did you say about her Odell\u2019\nMr Gardener coughed.",
    "He said \u2018Well darling I never did think very much of her you\nknow.\u2019\n\u2018That\u2019s the kind of thing men always say to their wives\u2019 said Mrs Gardener.",
    "\u2018And if you ask\nme even M. Poirot here is what I should call a shade on the indulgent side about her\ncalling her a natural victim and all that.",
    "Of course it\u2019s true that she wasn\u2019t a cultured\nwoman at all and as Captain Marshall isn\u2019t here I don\u2019t mind saying that she always did\nseem to me kind of dumb.",
    "I said so to Mr Gardener didn\u2019t I Odell\u2019\n\u2018Yes darling\u2019 said Mr Gardener.",
    "II\nLinda Marshall sat with Hercule Poirot on Gull Cove.",
    "She said \u2018Of course I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t die after all.",
    "But you know M. Poirot it\u2019s just the\nsame as if I\u2019d killed her isn\u2019t it I meant to.\u2019\nHercule Poirot said energetically \u2018It is not at all the same thing.",
    "The wish to kill and the\naction of killing are two different things.",
    "If in your bedroom instead of a little wax figure\nyou had had your stepmother bound and helpless and a dagger in your hand instead of a\npin you would not have pushed it into her heart Something within you would have said\n\u201cno\u201d.",
    "It is the same with me.",
    "I enrage myself at an imbecile.",
    "I say \u201cI would like to kick\nhim.\u201d Instead I kick the table.",
    "I say \u201cThis table it is the imbecile I kick him so.\u201d And then\nif I have not hurt my toe too much I feel much better and the table it is not usually\ndamaged.",
    "But if the imbecile himself was there I should not kick him.",
    "To make the wax\nfigures and stick in the pins it is silly yes it is childish yes\u2014but it does something useful\ntoo.",
    "You took the hate out of yourself and put it into that little figure.",
    "And with the pin and\nthe fire you destroyed\u2014not your stepmother\u2014but the hate you bore her.",
    "Afterwards\neven before you heard of her death you felt cleansed did you not\u2014you felt lighter\u2014\nhappier\u2019\nLinda nodded.",
    "She said \u2018How did you know That\u2019s just how I did feel.\u2019\nPoirot said \u2018Then do not repeat to yourself the imbecilities.",
    "Just make up your mind not to\nhate your next stepmother.\u2019\nLinda said startled \u2018Do you think I\u2019m going to have another Oh I see you mean\nRosamund.",
    "I don\u2019t mind her.\u2019 She hesitated a minute.",
    "\u2018She\u2019s sensible.\u2019\nIt was not the adjective that Poirot himself would have selected for Rosamund Darnley\nbut he realized that it was Linda\u2019s idea of high praise.",
    "III\n\n175\n\n\fKenneth Marshall said \u2018Rosamund did you get some extraordinary idea into your head\nthat I\u2019d killed Arlena.\u2019\nRosamund looked rather shamefaced.",
    "She said \u2018I suppose I was a damned fool.\u2019\n\u2018Of course you were.\u2019\n\u2018Yes but Ken you are such an oyster.",
    "I never knew what you really felt about Arlena.",
    "I\ndidn\u2019t know if you accepted her as she was and were just frightfully decent about her or\nwhether you\u2014well just believed in her blindly.",
    "And I thought if it was that and you\nsuddenly found out that she was letting you down you might go mad with rage.",
    "I\u2019ve heard\nstories about you.",
    "You\u2019re always very quiet but you\u2019re rather frightening sometimes.\u2019\n\u2018So you thought I just took her by the throat and throttled the life out of her\u2019\n\u2018Well\u2014yes\u2014that\u2019s just exactly what I did think.",
    "And your alibi seemed a bit on the light\nside.",
    "That\u2019s when I suddenly decided to take a hand and made up that silly story about\nseeing you typing in your room.",
    "And when I heard that you said you\u2019d seen me look in\u2014\nwell that made me quite sure you\u2019d done it.",
    "That and Linda\u2019s queerness.\u2019\nKenneth Marshall said with a sigh \u2018Don\u2019t you realize that I said I\u2019d seen you in the mirror\nin order to back up your story.",
    "I\u2014I thought you needed it corroborated.\u2019\nRosamund stared at him.",
    "\u2018You don\u2019t mean you thought that I killed your wife\u2019\nKenneth Marshall shifted uneasily.",
    "He mumbled \u2018Dash it all Rosamund don\u2019t you\nremember how you nearly killed that boy about that dog once How you hung on to his\nthroat and wouldn\u2019t let go.\u2019\n\u2018But that was years ago.\u2019\n\u2018Yes I know\u2014\u2019\nRosamund said sharply \u2018What earthly motive do you think I had to kill Arlena\u2019\nHis glance shifted.",
    "He mumbled something again.",
    "Rosamund cried \u2018Ken you mass of conceit You thought I killed her out of altruism on\nyour behalf did you Or\u2014did you think I killed her because I wanted you myself\u2019\n\u2018Not at all\u2019 said Kenneth Marshall indignantly.",
    "\u2018But you know what you said that day\u2014\nabout Linda and everything\u2014and\u2014and you seemed to care what happened to me.\u2019\nRosamund said \u2018I\u2019ve always cared about that.\u2019\n\n176\n\n\f\u2018I believe you have.",
    "You know Rosamund\u2014I can\u2019t usually talk about things\u2014I\u2019m not good\nat talking\u2014but I\u2019d like to get this clear.",
    "I didn\u2019t care for Arlena\u2014only just a little at first\u2014\nand living with her day after day was a pretty nerve\u2010racking business.",
    "In fact it was\nabsolute hell but I was awfully sorry for her.",
    "She was such a damned fool\u2014crazy about\nmen\u2014she just couldn\u2019t help it\u2014and they always let her down and treated her rottenly.",
    "I\nsimply felt I couldn\u2019t be the one to give her the final push.",
    "I\u2019d married her and it was up to\nme to look after her as best I could.",
    "I think she knew that and was grateful to me really.",
    "She was\u2014she was a pathetic sort of creature really.\u2019\nRosamund said gently \u2018It\u2019s all right Ken.",
    "I understand now.\u2019\nWithout looking at her Kenneth Marshall carefully filled a pipe.",
    "He mumbled \u2018You\u2019re\u2014\npretty good at understanding Rosamund.\u2019\nA faint smile curved Rosamund\u2019s ironic mouth.",
    "She said \u2018Are you going to ask me to marry\nyou now Ken or are you determined to wait six months\u2019\nKenneth Marshall\u2019s pipe dropped from his lips and crashed on the rocks below.",
    "He said \u2018Damn that\u2019s the second pipe I\u2019ve lost down here.",
    "And I haven\u2019t got another with\nme.",
    "How the devil did you know I\u2019d fixed six months as the proper time\u2019\n\u2018I suppose because it is the proper time.",
    "But I\u2019d rather have something definite now\nplease.",
    "Because in the intervening months you may come across some other persecuted\nfemale and rush to the rescue in chivalrous fashion again.\u2019\nHe laughed.",
    "\u2018You\u2019re going to be the persecuted female this time Rosamund.",
    "You\u2019re going to give up\nthat damned dress\u2010making business of yours and we\u2019re going to live in the country.\u2019\n\u2018Don\u2019t you know that I make a very handsome income out of my business Don\u2019t you\nrealize that it\u2019s my business\u2014that I created it and worked it up and that I\u2019m proud of it\nAnd you\u2019ve got the damned nerve to come along and say \u201cGive it all up dear.\u201d\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019ve got the damned nerve to say it yes.\u2019\n\u2018And you think I care enough for you to do it\u2019\n\u2018If you don\u2019t\u2019 said Kenneth Marshall \u2018you\u2019d be no good to me.\u2019\nRosamund said softly \u2018Oh my dear I\u2019ve wanted to live in the country with you all my life.",
    "Now\u2014it\u2019s going to come true...\u2019\n\n177"
