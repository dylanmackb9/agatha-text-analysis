    "\u2014Macbeth\n\n\f\n\fBOOK 1\nSUNNY RIDGE\n\n\fOne\nAUNT ADA\n\nMr. and Mrs. Beresford were sitting at the breakfast table.",
    "They were\nan ordinary couple.",
    "Hundreds of elderly couples just like them were\nhaving breakfast all over England at that particular moment.",
    "It was an\nordinary sort of day too the kind of day that you get five days out of\nseven.",
    "It looked as though it might rain but wasn\u2019t quite sure of it.",
    "Mr. Beresford had once had red hair.",
    "There were traces of the red\nstill but most of it had gone that sandycumgrey colour that redheaded\npeople so often arrive at in middle life.",
    "Mrs. Beresford had once had\nblack hair a vigorous curling mop of it.",
    "Now the black was adulterated\nwith streaks of grey laid on apparently at random.",
    "It made a rather\npleasant effect.",
    "Mrs. Beresford had once thought of dyeing her hair but\nin the end she had decided that she liked herself better as nature had\nmade her.",
    "She had decided instead to try a new shade of lipstick so as to\ncheer herself up.",
    "An elderly couple having breakfast together.",
    "A pleasant couple but\nnothing remarkable about them.",
    "So an onlooker would have said.",
    "If the\nonlooker had been young he or she would have added \u201cOh yes quite\npleasant but deadly dull of course like all old people.\u201d\nHowever Mr. and Mrs. Beresford had not yet arrived at the time of\nlife when they thought of themselves as old.",
    "And they had no idea that\nthey and many others were automatically pronounced deadly dull solely\non that account.",
    "Only by the young of course but then they would have\nthought indulgently young people knew nothing about life.",
    "Poor dears\nthey were always worrying about examinations or their sex life or\nbuying some extraordinary clothes or doing extraordinary things to their\n\n\fhair to make them more noticeable.",
    "Mr. and Mrs. Beresford from their\nown point of view were just past the prime of life.",
    "They liked themselves\nand liked each other and day succeeded day in a quiet but enjoyable\nfashion.",
    "There were of course moments everyone has moments.",
    "Mr.\nBeresford opened a letter glanced through it and laid it down adding it\nto the small pile by his left hand.",
    "He picked up the next letter but forbore\nto open it.",
    "Instead he stayed with it in his hand.",
    "He was not looking at the\nletter he was looking at the toast rack.",
    "His wife observed him for a few\nmoments before saying\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter Tommy\u201d\n\u201cMatter\u201d said Tommy vaguely.",
    "\u201cMatter\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I said\u201d said Mrs. Beresford.",
    "\u201cNothing is the matter\u201d said Mr. Beresford.",
    "\u201cWhat should it be\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve thought of something\u201d said Tuppence accusingly.",
    "\u201cI don\u2019t think I was thinking of anything at all.\u201d\n\u201cOh yes you were.",
    "Has anything happened\u201d\n\u201cNo of course not.",
    "What should happen\u201d He added \u201cI got the\nplumber\u2019s bill.\u201d\n\u201cOh\u201d said Tuppence with the air of one enlightened.",
    "\u201cMore than you\nexpected I suppose.\u201d\n\u201cNaturally\u201d said Tommy \u201cit always is.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t think why we didn\u2019t train as plumbers\u201d said Tuppence.",
    "\u201cIf\nyou\u2019d only trained as a plumber I could have been a plumber\u2019s mate and\nwe\u2019d be raking in money day by day.\u201d\n\u201cVery shortsighted of us not to see these opportunities.\u201d\n\u201cWas that the plumber\u2019s bill you were looking at just now\u201d\n\u201cOh no that was just an Appeal.\u201d\n\u201cDelinquent boys\u2014Racial integration\u201d\n\u201cNo.",
    "Just another Home they\u2019re opening for old people.\u201d\n\u201cWell that\u2019s more sensible anyway\u201d said Tuppence \u201cbut I don\u2019t see\nwhy you have to have that worried look about it.\u201d\n\u201cOh I wasn\u2019t thinking of that.\u201d\n\u201cWell what were you thinking of\u201d\n\u201cI suppose it put it into my mind\u201d said Mr. Beresford.",
    "\u201cWhat\u201d said Tuppence.",
    "\u201cYou know you\u2019ll tell me in the end.\u201d\n\u201cIt really wasn\u2019t anything important.",
    "I just thought that perhaps\u2014\nwell it was Aunt Ada.\u201d\n\u201cOh I see\u201d said Tuppence with instant comprehension.",
    "\u201cYes\u201d she\nadded softly meditatively.",
    "\u201cAunt Ada.\u201d\nTheir eyes met.",
    "It is regrettably true that in these days there is in\nnearly every family the problem of what might be called an \u201cAunt Ada.\u201d\nThe names are different\u2014Aunt Amelia Aunt Susan Aunt Cathy Aunt\nJoan.",
    "They are varied by grandmothers aged cousins and even greataunts.",
    "But they exist and present a problem in life which has to be dealt\nwith.",
    "Arrangements have to be made.",
    "Suitable establishments for looking\nafter the elderly have to be inspected and full questions asked about\nthem.",
    "Recommendations are sought from doctors from friends who\nhave Aunt Adas of their own who had been \u201cperfectly happy until she\nhad died\u201d at \u201cThe Laurels Bexhill\u201d or \u201cHappy Meadows at\nScarborough.\u201d\nThe days are past when Aunt Elisabeth Aunt Ada and the rest of\nthem lived on happily in the homes where they had lived for many years\npreviously looked after by devoted if sometimes somewhat tyrannical\nold servants.",
    "Both sides were thoroughly satisfied with the arrangement.",
    "Or there were the innumerable poor relations indigent nieces semiidiotic spinster cousins all yearning for a good home with three good\nmeals a day and a nice bedroom.",
    "Supply and demand complemented\neach other and all was well.",
    "Nowadays things are different.",
    "For the Aunt Adas of today arrangements have to be made suitable\nnot merely to an elderly lady who owing to arthritis or other rheumatic\ndifficulties is liable to fall downstairs if she is left alone in a house or\nwho suffers from chronic bronchitis or who quarrels with her\nneighbours and insults the tradespeople.",
    "Unfortunately the Aunt Adas are far more trouble than the opposite\nend of the age scale.",
    "Children can be provided with foster homes foisted\noff on relations or sent to suitable schools where they stay for the\nholidays or arrangements can be made for pony treks or camps and on\nthe whole very little objection is made by the children to the\narrangements so made for them.",
    "The Aunt Adas are very different.",
    "Tuppence Beresford\u2019s own aunt\u2014Greataunt Primrose\u2014had been a\nnotable troublemaker.",
    "Impossible to satisfy her.",
    "No sooner did she enter\nan establishment guaranteed to provide a good home and all comforts for\nelderly ladies than after writing a few highly complimentary letters to her\nniece praising this particular establishment the next news would be that\nshe had indignantly walked out of it without notice.",
    "\u201cImpossible.",
    "I couldn\u2019t stay there another minute\u201d\nWithin the space of a year Aunt Primrose had been in and out of\neleven such establishments finally writing to say that she had now met a\nvery charming young man.",
    "\u201cReally a very devoted boy.",
    "He lost his\nmother at a young age and he badly needs looking after.",
    "I have rented a\nflat and he is coming to live with me.",
    "This arrangement will suit us both\nperfectly.",
    "We are natural affinities.",
    "You need have no more anxieties\ndear Prudence.",
    "My future is settled.",
    "I am seeing my lawyer tomorrow as\nit is necessary that I should make some provision for Mervyn if I should\npredecease him which is of course the natural course of events though I\nassure you at the moment I feel in the pink of health.\u201d\nTuppence had hurried north the incident had taken place in\nAberdeen.",
    "But as it happened the police had arrived there first and had\nremoved the glamorous Mervyn for whom they had been seeking for\nsome time on a charge of obtaining money under false pretences.",
    "Aunt\nPrimrose had been highly indignant and had called it persecution\u2014but\nafter attending the Court proceedings where twentyfive other cases\nwere taken into account\u2014had been forced to change her views of her\nprot\u00e9g\u00e9.",
    "\u201cI think I ought to go and see Aunt Ada you know Tuppence\u201d said\nTommy.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s been some time.\u201d\n\u201cI suppose so\u201d said Tuppence without enthusiasm.",
    "\u201cHow long has it\nbeen\u201d\nTommy considered.",
    "\u201cIt must be nearly a year\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s more than that\u201d said Tuppence.",
    "\u201cI think it\u2019s over a year.\u201d\n\u201cOh dear\u201d said Tommy \u201cthe time does go so fast doesn\u2019t it I can\u2019t\nbelieve it\u2019s been as long as that.",
    "Still I believe you\u2019re right Tuppence.\u201d\nHe calculated.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s awful the way one forgets isn\u2019t it I really feel very\nbadly about it.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cI don\u2019t think you need\u201d said Tuppence.",
    "\u201cAfter all we send her\nthings and we write letters.\u201d\n\u201cOh yes I know.",
    "You\u2019re awfully good about those sort of things\nTuppence.",
    "But all the same one does read things sometimes that are very\nupsetting.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re thinking of that dreadful book we got from the library\u201d said\nTuppence \u201cand how awful it was for the poor old dears.",
    "How they\nsuffered.\u201d\n\u201cI suppose it was true\u2014taken from life.\u201d\n\u201cOh yes\u201d said Tuppence \u201cthere must be places like that.",
    "And there\nare people who are terribly unhappy who can\u2019t help being unhappy.",
    "But\nwhat else is one to do Tommy\u201d\n\u201cWhat can anyone do except be as careful as possible.",
    "Be very\ncareful what you choose find out all about it and make sure she\u2019s got a\nnice doctor looking after her.\u201d\n\u201cNobody could be nicer than Dr. Murray you must admit that.\u201d\n\u201cYes\u201d said Tommy the worried look receding from his face.",
    "\u201cMurray\u2019s a firstclass chap.",
    "Kind patient.",
    "If anything was going wrong\nhe\u2019d let us know.\u201d\n\u201cSo I don\u2019t think you need worry about it\u201d said Tuppence.",
    "\u201cHow old\nis she by now\u201d\n\u201cEightytwo\u201d said Tommy.",
    "\u201cNo\u2014no.",
    "I think it\u2019s eightythree\u201d he\nadded.",
    "\u201cIt must be rather awful when you\u2019ve outlived everybody.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s only what we feel\u201d said Tuppence.",
    "\u201cThey don\u2019t feel it.\u201d\n\u201cYou can\u2019t really tell.\u201d\n\u201cWell your Aunt Ada doesn\u2019t.",
    "Don\u2019t you remember the glee with\nwhich she told us the number of her old friends that she\u2019d already\noutlived She finished up by saying \u2018and as for Amy Morgan I\u2019ve heard\nshe won\u2019t last more than another six months.",
    "She always used to say I\nwas so delicate and now it\u2019s practically a certainty that I shall outlive her.",
    "Outlive her by a good many years too.\u2019 Triumphant that\u2019s what she was\nat the prospect.\u201d\n\u201cAll the same\u2014\u201d said Tommy.",
    "\u201cI know\u201d said Tuppence \u201cI know.",
    "All the same you feel it\u2019s your\nduty and so you\u2019ve got to go.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cDon\u2019t you think I\u2019m right\u201d\n\u201cUnfortunately\u201d said Tuppence \u201cI do think you\u2019re right.",
    "Absolutely\nright.",
    "And I\u2019ll come too\u201d she added with a slight note of heroism in her\nvoice.",
    "\u201cNo\u201d said Tommy.",
    "\u201cWhy should you She\u2019s not your aunt.",
    "No I\u2019ll\ngo.\u201d\n\u201cNot at all\u201d said Mrs. Beresford.",
    "\u201cI like to suffer too.",
    "We\u2019ll suffer\ntogether.",
    "You won\u2019t enjoy it and I shan\u2019t enjoy it and I don\u2019t think for\none moment that Aunt Ada will enjoy it.",
    "But I quite see it is one of those\nthings that has got to be done.\u201d\n\u201cNo I don\u2019t want you to go.",
    "After all the last time remember how\nfrightfully rude she was to you\u201d\n\u201cOh I didn\u2019t mind that\u201d said Tuppence.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s probably the only bit of\nthe visit that the poor old girl enjoyed.",
    "I don\u2019t grudge it to her not for a\nmoment.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve always been nice to her\u201d said Tommy \u201ceven though you\ndon\u2019t like her very much.\u201d\n\u201cNobody could like Aunt Ada\u201d said Tuppence.",
    "\u201cIf you ask me I\ndon\u2019t think anyone ever has.\u201d\n\u201cOne can\u2019t help feeling sorry for people when they get old\u201d said\nTommy.",
    "\u201cI can\u201d said Tuppence.",
    "\u201cI haven\u2019t got as nice a nature as you have.\u201d\n\u201cBeing a woman you\u2019re more ruthless\u201d said Tommy.",
    "\u201cI suppose that might be it.",
    "After all women haven\u2019t really got time\nto be anything but realistic over things.",
    "I mean I\u2019m very sorry for people\nif they\u2019re old or sick or anything if they\u2019re nice people.",
    "But if they\u2019re\nnot nice people well it\u2019s different you must admit.",
    "If you\u2019re pretty\nnasty when you\u2019re twenty and just as nasty when you\u2019re forty and nastier\nstill when you\u2019re sixty and a perfect devil by the time you\u2019re eighty\u2014\nwell really I don\u2019t see why one should be particularly sorry for people\njust because they\u2019re old.",
    "You can\u2019t change yourself really.",
    "I know some\nabsolute ducks who are seventy and eighty.",
    "Old Mrs. Beauchamp and\nMary Carr and the baker\u2019s grandmother dear old Mrs. Poplett who used\nto come in and clean for us.",
    "They were all dears and sweet and I\u2019d do\nanything I could for them.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cAll right all right\u201d said Tommy \u201cbe realistic.",
    "But if you really\nwant to be noble and come with me\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI want to come with you\u201d said Tuppence.",
    "\u201cAfter all I married you\nfor better or for worse and Aunt Ada is decidedly the worse.",
    "So I shall go\nwith you hand in hand.",
    "And we\u2019ll take her a bunch of flowers and a box\nof chocolates with soft centres and perhaps a magazine or two.",
    "You\nmight write to Miss What\u2019shername and say we\u2019re coming.\u201d\n\u201cOne day next week I could manage Tuesday\u201d said Tommy \u201cif\nthat\u2019s all right for you.\u201d\n\u201cTuesday it is\u201d said Tuppence.",
    "\u201cWhat\u2019s the name of the woman I\ncan\u2019t remember\u2014the matron or the superintendent or whoever she is.",
    "Begins with a P.\u201d\n\u201cMiss Packard.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps it\u2019ll be different this time\u201d said Tommy.",
    "\u201cDifferent In what way\u201d\n\u201cOh I don\u2019t know.",
    "Something interesting might happen.\u201d\n\u201cWe might be in a railway accident on the way there\u201d said\nTuppence brightening up a little.",
    "\u201cWhy on earth do you want to be in a railway accident\u201d\n\u201cWell I don\u2019t really of course.",
    "It was just\u2014\u201d\n\u201cJust what\u201d\n\u201cWell it would be an adventure of some kind wouldn\u2019t it Perhaps\nwe could save lives or do something useful.",
    "Useful and at the same time\nexciting.\u201d\n\u201cWhat a hope\u201d said Mr. Beresford.",
    "\u201cI know\u201d agreed Tuppence.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s just that these sort of ideas come to\none sometimes.\u201d\n\n\fTwo\nWAS IT YOUR POOR CHILD\n\nHow Sunny Ridge had come by its name would be difficult to say.",
    "There was nothing prominently ridgelike about it.",
    "The grounds were flat\nwhich was eminently more suitable for the elderly occupants.",
    "It had an\nample though rather undistinguished garden.",
    "It was a fairly large\nVictorian mansion kept in a good state of repair.",
    "There were some\npleasant shady trees a Virginia creeper running up the side of the house\nand two monkey puzzles gave an exotic air to the scene.",
    "There were\nseveral benches in advantageous places to catch the sun one or two\ngarden chairs and a sheltered veranda on which the old ladies could sit\nsheltered from the east winds.",
    "Tommy rang the front doorbell and he and Tuppence were duly\nadmitted by a rather harassedlooking young woman in a nylon overall.",
    "She showed them into a small sitting room saying rather breathlessly\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell Miss Packard.",
    "She\u2019s expecting you and she\u2019ll be down in a\nminute.",
    "You won\u2019t mind waiting just a little will you but it\u2019s old Mrs.\nCarraway.",
    "She\u2019s been and swallowed her thimble again you see.\u201d\n\u201cHow on earth did she do a thing like that\u201d asked Tuppence\nsurprised.",
    "\u201cDoes it for fun\u201d explained the household help briefly.",
    "\u201cAlways\ndoing it.\u201d\nShe departed and Tuppence sat down and said thoughtfully \u201cI don\u2019t\nthink I should like to swallow a thimble.",
    "It\u2019d be awfully bobbly as it\nwent down.",
    "Don\u2019t you think so\u201d\nThey had not very long to wait however before the door opened and\nMiss Packard came in apologizing as she did so.",
    "She was a big sandy\n\n\fhaired woman of about fifty with the air of calm competence about her\nwhich Tommy had always admired.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m sorry if I have kept you waiting Mr. Beresford\u201d she said.",
    "\u201cHow\ndo you do Mrs. Beresford I\u2019m so glad you\u2019ve come too.\u201d\n\u201cSomebody swallowed something I hear\u201d said Tommy.",
    "\u201cOh so Marlene told you that Yes it was old Mrs. Carraway.",
    "She\u2019s\nalways swallowing things.",
    "Very difficult you know because one can\u2019t\nwatch them all the time.",
    "Of course one knows children do it but it seems\na funny thing to be a hobby of an elderly woman doesn\u2019t it It\u2019s grown\nupon her you know.",
    "She gets worse every year.",
    "It doesn\u2019t seem to do her\nany harm that\u2019s the cheeriest thing about it.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps her father was a sword swallower\u201d suggested Tuppence.",
    "\u201cNow that\u2019s a very interesting idea Mrs. Beresford.",
    "Perhaps it would\nexplain things.\u201d She went on \u201cI\u2019ve told Miss Fanshawe that you were\ncoming Mr. Beresford.",
    "I don\u2019t know really whether she quite took it in.",
    "She doesn\u2019t always you know.\u201d\n\u201cHow has she been lately\u201d\n\u201cWell she\u2019s failing rather rapidly now I\u2019m afraid\u201d said Miss\nPackard in a comfortable voice.",
    "\u201cOne never really knows how much she\ntakes in and how much she doesn\u2019t.",
    "I told her last night and she said she\nwas sure I must be mistaken because it was term time.",
    "She seemed to\nthink that you were still at school.",
    "Poor old things they get very\nmuddled up sometimes especially over time.",
    "However this morning\nwhen I reminded her about your visit she just said it was quite\nimpossible because you were dead.",
    "Oh well\u201d Miss Packard went on\ncheerfully \u201cI expect she\u2019ll recognize you when she sees you.\u201d\n\u201cHow is she in health Much the same\u201d\n\u201cWell perhaps as well as can be expected.",
    "Frankly you know I don\u2019t\nthink she\u2019ll be with us very much longer.",
    "She doesn\u2019t suffer in any way\nbut her heart condition\u2019s no better than it was.",
    "In fact it\u2019s rather worse.",
    "So I think I\u2019d like you to know that it\u2019s just as well to be prepared so\nthat if she did go suddenly it wouldn\u2019t be any shock to you.\u201d\n\u201cWe brought her some flowers\u201d said Tuppence.",
    "\u201cAnd a box of chocolates\u201d said Tommy.",
    "\u201cOh that\u2019s very kind of you I\u2019m sure.",
    "She\u2019ll be very pleased.",
    "Would\nyou like to come up now\u201d\nTommy and Tuppence rose and followed Miss Packard from the\nroom.",
    "She led them up the broad staircase.",
    "As they passed one of the\nrooms in the passage upstairs it opened suddenly and a little woman\nabout five foot high trotted out calling in a loud shrill voice \u201cI want my\ncocoa.",
    "I want my cocoa.",
    "Where\u2019s Nurse Jane I want my cocoa.\u201d\nA woman in a nurse\u2019s uniform popped out of the next door and said\n\u201cThere there dear it\u2019s all right.",
    "You\u2019ve had your cocoa.",
    "You had it\ntwenty minutes ago.\u201d\n\u201cNo I didn\u2019t Nurse.",
    "It\u2019s not true.",
    "I haven\u2019t had my cocoa.",
    "I\u2019m\nthirsty.\u201d\n\u201cWell you shall have another cup if you like.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t have another when I haven\u2019t had one.\u201d\nThey passed on and Miss Packard after giving a brief rap on a door\nat the end of the passage opened it and passed in.",

    "She does like being rude to people.",

    "Things that they believe have happened to them.",
    "Or to\nother people.",
    "We try not to take any notice not to encourage them.",
    "Just\nplay it down.",
    "I think really it\u2019s just an exercise in imagination a sort of\nphantasy they like to live in.",
    "Something exciting or something sad and\ntragic.",
    "It doesn\u2019t matter which.",
    "But no persecution mania thank\ngoodness.",
    "That would never do.\u201d\n\u201cWell that\u2019s over\u201d said Tommy with a sigh as he got into the car.",
    "\u201cWe shan\u2019t need to come again for at least six months.\u201d\nBut they didn\u2019t need to go and see her in six months for three weeks\nlater Aunt Ada died in her sleep.",

    "Tommy went over to it and duly brought back what he considered\nappropriate.",
    "In this case a White Lady.",

    "You can make me another\nWhite Lady.\u201d\n\u201cReally Tuppence I had no idea that funerals would bring out this\nparty feeling.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cI said funerals were sad\u201d said Tuppence when she reappeared a\nmoment or two later wearing a brilliant cherryred dress with a ruby and\ndiamond lizard pinned to the shoulder of it \u201cbecause it\u2019s funerals like\nAunt Ada\u2019s that are sad.",
    "I mean elderly people and not many flowers.",
    "Not a lot of people sobbing and sniffing round.",
    "Someone old and lonely\nwho won\u2019t be missed much.\u201d\n\u201cI should have thought it would be much easier for you to stand that\nthan it would if it were my funeral for instance.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s where you\u2019re entirely wrong\u201d said Tuppence.",
    "\u201cI don\u2019t\nparticularly want to think of your funeral because I\u2019d much prefer to die\nbefore you do.",
    "But I mean if I were going to your funeral at any rate it\nwould be an orgy of grief.",
    "I should take a lot of handkerchiefs.\u201d\n\u201cWith black borders\u201d\n\u201cWell I hadn\u2019t thought of black borders but it\u2019s a nice idea.",
    "And\nbesides the Burial service is rather lovely.",
    "Makes you feel uplifted.",
    "Real\ngrief is real.",
    "It makes you feel awful but it does something to you.",
    "I\nmean it works it out like perspiration.\u201d\n\u201cReally Tuppence I find your remarks about my decease and the\neffect it will have upon you in exceedingly bad taste.",
    "I don\u2019t like it.",
    "Let\u2019s\nforget about funerals.\u201d\n\u201cI agree.",

    "I suppose so.",
    "I never heard her mention them.",
    "I\nbelieve\u201d said Tommy thoughtfully \u201cshe used to get rather a lot of fun\nout of saying to old friends of hers when they came to see her \u2018I\u2019ve left\nyou a little something in my will dear\u2019 or \u2018This brooch that you\u2019re so\nfond of I\u2019ve left you in my will.\u2019 She didn\u2019t actually leave anything to\nanyone except the Cats\u2019 Home.\u201d\n\u201cI bet she got rather a kick out of that\u201d said Tuppence.",
    "\u201cI can just see\nher saying all the things you told me to a lot of her old friends\u2014or socalled old friends because I don\u2019t suppose they were people she really\nliked at all.",
    "She just enjoyed leading them up the garden path.",
    "I must say\nshe was an old devil wasn\u2019t she Tommy Only in a funny sort of way\none likes her for being an old devil.",
    "It\u2019s something to be able to get some\nfun out of life when you\u2019re old and stuck away in a Home.",
    "Shall we have\nto go to Sunny Ridge\u201d\n\u201cWhere\u2019s the other letter the one from Miss Packard Oh yes here it\nis.",
    "I put it with Rockbury\u2019s.",
    "Yes she says there are certain things there I\ngather which apparently are now my property.",
    "She took some furniture\nwith her you know when she went to live there.",
    "And of course there are\nher personal effects.",
    "Clothes and things like that.",
    "I suppose somebody\nwill have to go through them.",
    "And letters and things.",
    "I\u2019m her executor\nso I suppose it\u2019s up to me.",
    "I don\u2019t suppose there\u2019s anything we want\nreally is there Except there\u2019s a small desk there that I always liked.",
    "Belonged to old Uncle William I believe.\u201d\n\u201cWell you might take that as a memento\u201d said Tuppence.",
    "\u201cOtherwise I suppose we just send the things to be auctioned.\u201d\n\u201cSo you don\u2019t really need to go there at all\u201d said Tommy.",
    "\u201cOh I think I\u2019d like to go there\u201d said Tuppence.",
    "\u201cYou\u2019d like to Why Won\u2019t it be rather a bore to you\u201d\n\u201cWhat looking through her things No I don\u2019t think so.",
    "I think I\u2019ve\ngot a certain amount of curiosity.",
    "Old letters and antique jewellery are\nalways interesting and I think one ought to look at them oneself not just\nsend them to auction or let strangers go through them.",
    "No we\u2019ll go and\nlook through the things and see if there\u2019s anything we would like to keep\nand otherwise settle up.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cWhy do you really want to go You\u2019ve got some other reason\nhaven\u2019t you\u201d\n\u201cOh dear\u201d said Tuppence \u201cit is awful being married to someone\nwho knows too much about one.\u201d\n\u201cSo you have got another reason\u201d\n\u201cNot a real one.\u201d\n\u201cCome on Tuppence.",
    "You\u2019re not really so fond of turning over\npeople\u2019s belongings.\u201d\n\u201cThat I think is my duty\u201d said Tuppence firmly.",
    "\u201cNo the only other\nreason is\u2014\u201d\n\u201cCome on.",
    "Cough it up.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d rather like to see that\u2014that other old pussy again.\u201d\n\u201cWhat the one who thought there was a dead child behind the\nfireplace\u201d\n\u201cYes\u201d said Tuppence.",
    "\u201cI\u2019d like to talk to her again.",
    "I\u2019d like to know\nwhat was in her mind when she said all those things.",
    "Was it something\nshe remembered or was it something that she\u2019d just imagined The more\nI think about it the more extraordinary it seems.",
    "Is it a sort of story that\nshe wrote to herself in her mind or is there\u2014was there once something\nreal that happened about a fireplace or about a dead child.",
    "What made\nher think that the dead child might have been my dead child Do I look\nas though I had a dead child\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how you expect anyone to look who has a dead child\u201d\nsaid Tommy.",
    "\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have thought so.",
    "Anyway Tuppence it is our\nduty to go and you can enjoy yourself in your macabre way on the side.",
    "So that\u2019s settled.",
    "We\u2019ll write to Miss Packard and fix a day.\u201d\n\n\fFour\nPICTURE OF A HOUSE\n\nTuppence drew a deep breath.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s just the same\u201d she said.",
    "She and Tommy were standing on the front doorstep of Sunny Ridge.",
    "\u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t it be\u201d asked Tommy.",
    "\u201cI don\u2019t know.",
    "It\u2019s just a feeling I have\u2014something to do with time.",
    "Time goes at a different pace in different places.",
    "Some places you come\nback to and you feel that time has been bustling along at a terrific rate\nand that all sorts of things will have happened\u2014and changed.",
    "But here\u2014\nTommy\u2014do you remember Ostend\u201d\n\u201cOstend We went there on our honeymoon.",
    "Of course I remember.\u201d\n\u201cAnd do you remember the sign written up TRAMSTILLSTAND\u2014It\nmade us laugh.",
    "It seemed so ridiculous.\u201d\n\u201cI think it was Knock\u2014not Ostend.\u201d\n\u201cNever mind\u2014you remember it.",
    "Well this is like that word\u2014\nTramstillstand\u2014a portmanteau word.",
    "Timestillstand\u2014nothing\u2019s\nhappened here.",
    "Time has just stood still.",
    "Everything\u2019s going on here just\nthe same.",
    "It\u2019s like ghosts only the other way round.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what you are talking about.",
    "Are you going to stand\nhere all day talking about time and not even ring the bell\u2014Aunt Ada\nisn\u2019t here for one thing.",
    "That\u2019s different.\u201d He pressed the bell.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s the only thing that will be different.",
    "My old lady will be\ndrinking milk and talking about fireplaces and Mrs. Somebodyorother\nwill have swallowed a thimble or a teaspoon and a funny little woman\nwill come squeaking out of a room demanding her cocoa and Miss\nPackard will come down the stairs and\u2014\u201d\n\n\fThe door opened.",
    "A young woman in a nylon overall said \u201cMr.",
    "and\nMrs. Beresford Miss Packard\u2019s expecting you.\u201d\nThe young woman was just about to show them into the same sitting\nroom as before when Miss Packard came down the stairs and greeted\nthem.",
    "Her manner was suitably not quite as brisk as usual.",
    "It was grave\nand had a kind of semimourning about it\u2014not too much\u2014that might\nhave been embarrassing.",
    "She was an expert in the exact amount of\ncondolence which would be acceptable.",
    "Three score years and ten was the Biblical accepted span of life and\nthe deaths in her establishment seldom occurred below that figure.",
    "They\nwere to be expected and they happened.",
    "\u201cSo good of you to come.",
    "I\u2019ve got everything laid out tidily for you\nto look through.",
    "I\u2019m glad you could come so soon because as a matter of\nfact I have already three or four people waiting for a vacancy to come\nhere.",
    "You will understand I\u2019m sure and not think that I was trying to\nhurry you in any way.\u201d\n\u201cOh no of course we quite understand\u201d said Tommy.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s all still in the room Miss Fanshawe occupied\u201d Miss Packard\nexplained.",
    "Miss Packard opened the door of the room in which they had last\nseen Aunt Ada.",
    "It had that deserted look a room has when the bed is\ncovered with a dust sheet with the shapes showing beneath it of foldedup blankets and neatly arranged pillows.",
    "The wardrobe doors stood open and the clothes it had held had been\nlaid on the top of the bed neatly folded.",
    "\u201cWhat do you usually do\u2014I mean what do people do mostly with\nclothes and things like that\u201d said Tuppence.",
    "Miss Packard as invariably was competent and helpful.",
    "\u201cI can give you the name of two or three societies who are only too\npleased to have things of that kind.",
    "She had quite a good fur stole and a\ngood quality coat but I don\u2019t suppose you would have any personal use\nfor them But perhaps you have charities of your own where you would\nlike to dispose of things.\u201d\nTuppence shook her head.",
    "\u201cShe had some jewellery\u201d said Miss Packard.",
    "\u201cI removed that for\nsafekeeping.",
    "You will find it in the righthand drawer of the dressing\ntable.",
    "I put it there just before you were due to arrive.\u201d\n\u201cThank you very much\u201d said Tommy \u201cfor the trouble you have\ntaken.\u201d\nTuppence was staring at a picture over the mantelpiece.",
    "It was a\nsmall oil painting representing a pale pink house standing adjacent to a\ncanal spanned by a small humpbacked bridge.",
    "There was an empty boat\ndrawn up under the bridge against the bank of the canal.",
    "In the distance\nwere two poplar trees.",
    "It was a very pleasant little scene but nevertheless\nTommy wondered why Tuppence was staring at it with such earnestness.",
    "\u201cHow funny\u201d murmured Tuppence.",
    "Tommy looked at her inquiringly.",
    "The things that Tuppence thought\nfunny were he knew by long experience not really to be described by\nsuch an adjective at all.",
    "\u201cWhat do you mean Tuppence\u201d\n\u201cIt is funny.",
    "I never noticed that picture when I was here before.",
    "But\nthe odd thing is that I have seen that house somewhere.",
    "Or perhaps it\u2019s a\nhouse just like that that I have seen.",
    "I remember it quite well .",
    ". .",
    "Funny\nthat I can\u2019t remember when and where.\u201d\n\u201cI expect you noticed it without really noticing you were noticing\u201d\nsaid Tommy feeling his choice of words was rather clumsy and nearly as\npainfully repetitive as Tuppence\u2019s reiteration of the word \u201cfunny.\u201d\n\u201cDid you notice it Tommy when we were here last time\u201d\n\u201cNo but then I didn\u2019t look particularly.\u201d\n\u201cOh that picture\u201d said Miss Packard.",
    "\u201cNo I don\u2019t think you would\nhave seen it when you were here the last time because I\u2019m almost sure it\nwasn\u2019t hanging over the mantelpiece then.",
    "Actually it was a picture\nbelonging to one of our other guests and she gave it to your aunt.",
    "Miss\nFanshawe expressed admiration of it once or twice and this other old\nlady made her a present of it and insisted she should have it.\u201d\n\u201cOh I see\u201d said Tuppence \u201cso of course I couldn\u2019t have seen it here\nbefore.",
    "But I still feel I know the house quite well.",
    "Don\u2019t you Tommy\u201d\n\u201cNo\u201d said Tommy.",
    "\u201cWell I\u2019ll leave you now\u201d said Miss Packard briskly.",

    "\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with them\u201d\n\u201cToo many of them.",
    "Or too big\u2014\u2018The better to eat you with my\nchild\u2019\u2014Like Red Riding Hood\u2019s grandmother.\u201d\n\u201cYou seem in a very odd sort of mood today Tuppence.\u201d\n\u201cI am rather.",
    "I\u2019ve always thought of Miss Packard as very nice\u2014but\ntoday somehow she seems to me rather sinister.",
    "Have you ever felt\nthat\u201d\n\u201cNo I haven\u2019t.",
    "Come on let\u2019s get on with what we came here to do\n\u2014look over poor old Aunt Ada\u2019s \u2018effects\u2019 as the lawyers call them.",

    "Do you like it\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s lovely.",
    "Regency I should think.",
    "It\u2019s nice for the old people who\ncome here to be able to bring some of their own things with them.",
    "I don\u2019t\ncare for the horsehair chairs but I\u2019d like that little worktable.",
    "It\u2019s just\nwhat we need for that corner by the window where we\u2019ve got that\nperfectly hideous whatnot.\u201d\n\u201cAll right\u201d said Tommy.",
    "\u201cI\u2019ll make a note of those two.\u201d\n\u201cAnd we\u2019ll have the picture over the mantelpiece.",
    "It\u2019s an awfully\nattractive picture and I\u2019m quite sure that I\u2019ve seen that house somewhere.",
    "Now let\u2019s look at the jewellery.\u201d\nThey opened the dressingtable drawer.",
    "There was a set of cameos\nand a Florentine bracelet and earrings and a ring with differentcoloured\nstones in it.",

    "She\u2019s frightfully keen on Victorian things.",
    "A lot of people\nare nowadays.",
    "Now I suppose we\u2019d better do the clothes.",
    "That\u2019s always\nrather macabre I think.",
    "Oh this is the fur stole.",
    "Quite valuable I should\nthink.",
    "I wouldn\u2019t want it myself.",
    "I wonder if there\u2019s anyone here\u2014\nanyone who was especially nice to Aunt Ada\u2014or perhaps some special\nfriend among the other inmates\u2014visitors I mean.",

    "One of her special friends perhaps\nOr perhaps one of the nurses who had done some special waiting on\nAunt Ada\u201d\n\u201cThat is a very kind thought of yours Mrs. Beresford.",
    "I\u2019m afraid\nMiss Fanshawe hadn\u2019t any special friends among our visitors but Miss\nO\u2019Keefe one of the nurses did do a lot for her and was especially good\nand tactful and I think she\u2019d be pleased and honoured to have it.\u201d\n\u201cAnd there\u2019s the picture over the mantelpiece\u201d said Tuppence.",
    "\u201cI\u2019d\nlike to have that\u2014but perhaps the person whom it belonged to and who\ngave it to her would want to have it back.",
    "I think we ought to ask her\n\u2014\u201d\n\n\fMiss Packard interrupted.",
    "\u201cOh I\u2019m sorry Mrs. Beresford I\u2019m afraid\nwe can\u2019t do that.",
    "It was a Mrs. Lancaster who gave it to Miss Fanshawe\nand she isn\u2019t with us any longer.\u201d\n\u201cIsn\u2019t with you\u201d said Tuppence surprised.",
    "\u201cA Mrs. Lancaster The\none I saw last time I was here\u2014with white hair brushed back from her\nface.",
    "She was drinking milk in the sitting room downstairs.",
    "She\u2019s gone\naway you say\u201d\n\u201cYes.",
    "It was all rather sudden.",
    "One of her relations a Mrs. Johnson\ntook her away about a week ago.",
    "Mrs. Johnson had returned from Africa\nwhere she\u2019s been living for the last four or five years\u2014quite\nunexpectedly.",
    "She is now able to take care of Mrs. Lancaster in her own\nhome since she and her husband are taking a house in England.",
    "I don\u2019t\nthink\u201d said Miss Packard \u201cthat Mrs. Lancaster really wanted to leave\nus.",
    "She had become so\u2014set in her ways here and she got on very well\nwith everyone and was happy.",
    "She was very disturbed quite tearful\nabout it\u2014but what can one do She hadn\u2019t really very much say in the\nmatter because of course the Johnsons were paying for her stay here.",
    "I\ndid suggest that as she had been here so long and settled down so well it\nmight be advisable to let her remain\u2014\u201d\n\u201cHow long had Mrs. Lancaster been with you asked Tuppence.",
    "\u201cOh nearly six years I think.",
    "Yes that\u2019s about it.",
    "That\u2019s why of\ncourse she\u2019d really come to feel that this was her home.\u201d\n\u201cYes\u201d said Tuppence.",
    "\u201cYes I can understand that.\u201d She frowned and\ngave a nervous glance at Tommy and then stuck a resolute chin into the\nair.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m sorry she\u2019s left.",
    "I had a feeling when I was talking to her that I\u2019d\nmet her before\u2014her face seemed familiar to me.",
    "And then afterwards it\ncame back to me that I\u2019d met her with an old friend of mine a Mrs.\nBlenkensop.",
    "I thought when I came back here again to visit Aunt Ada\nthat I\u2019d find out from her if that was so.",
    "But of course if she\u2019s gone back\nto her own people that\u2019s different.\u201d\n\u201cI quite understand Mrs. Beresford.",
    "If any of our visitors can get in\ntouch with some of their old friends or someone who knew their relations\nat one time it makes a great difference to them.",
    "I can\u2019t remember a Mrs.\n\n\fBlenkensop ever having been mentioned by her but then I don\u2019t suppose\nthat would be likely to happen in any case.\u201d\n\u201cCan you tell me a little more about her who her relations were and\nhow she came to come here\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s really very little to tell.",
    "As I said it was about six years ago\nthat we had letters from Mrs. Johnson inquiring about the Home and\nthen Mrs. Johnson herself came here and inspected it.",
    "She said she\u2019d had\nmentions of Sunny Ridge from a friend and she inquired the terms and\nall that and\u2014then she went away.",
    "And about a week or a fortnight later\nwe had a letter from a firm of solicitors in London making further\ninquiries and finally they wrote saying that they would like us to accept\nMrs. Lancaster and that Mrs. Johnson would bring her here in about a\nweek\u2019s time if we had a vacancy.",
    "As it happened we had and Mrs.\nJohnson brought Mrs. Lancaster here and Mrs. Lancaster seemed to like\nthe place and liked the room that we proposed to allot her.",
    "Mrs. Johnson\nsaid that Mrs. Lancaster would like to bring some of her own things.",
    "I\nquite agreed because people usually do that and find they\u2019re much\nhappier.",
    "So it was all arranged very satisfactorily.",
    "Mrs. Johnson\nexplained that Mrs. Lancaster was a relation of her husband\u2019s not a very\nnear one but that they felt worried about her because they themselves\nwere going out to Africa\u2014to Nigeria I think it was her husband was\ntaking up an appointment there and it was likely they\u2019d be there for some\nyears before they returned to England so as they had no home to offer\nMrs. Lancaster they wanted to make sure that she was accepted in a\nplace where she would be really happy.",
    "They were quite sure from what\nthey\u2019d heard about this place that that was so.",
    "So it was all arranged very\nhappily indeed and Mrs. Lancaster settled down here very well.\u201d\n\u201cI see.\u201d\n\u201cEveryone here liked Mrs. Lancaster very much.",
    "She was a little bit\n\u2014well you know what I mean\u2014woolly in the head.",
    "I mean she forgot\nthings confused things and couldn\u2019t remember names and addresses\nsometimes.\u201d\n\u201cDid she get many letters\u201d said Tuppence.",
    "\u201cI mean letters from\nabroad and things\u201d\n\n\f\u201cWell I think Mrs. Johnson\u2014or Mr. Johnson\u2014wrote once or twice\nfrom Africa but not after the first year.",
    "People I\u2019m afraid do forget you\nknow.",
    "Especially when they go to a new country and a different life and\nI don\u2019t think they\u2019d been very closely in touch with her at any time.",
    "I\nthink it was just a distant relation and a family responsibility and that\nwas all it meant to them.",
    "All the financial arrangements were done\nthrough the lawyer Mr. Eccles a very nice reputable firm.",
    "Actually\nwe\u2019d had one or two dealings with that firm before so that we new about\nthem as they knew about us.",
    "But I think most of Mrs. Lancaster\u2019s\nfriends and relations had passed over and so she didn\u2019t hear much from\nanyone and I think hardly anyone ever came to visit her.",
    "One very nicelooking man came about a year later I think.",
    "I don\u2019t think he knew her\npersonally at all well but he was a friend of Mr. Johnson\u2019s and had also\nbeen in the Colonial service overseas.",
    "I think he just came to make sure\nshe was well and happy.\u201d\n\u201cAnd after that\u201d said Tuppence \u201ceveryone forgot about her.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid so\u201d said Miss Packard.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s sad isn\u2019t it But it\u2019s the\nusual rather than the unusual thing to happen.",
    "Fortunately most visitors\nto us make their own friends here.",
    "They get friendly with someone who\nhas their own tastes or certain memories in common and so things settle\ndown quite happily.",
    "I think most of them forget most of their past life.\u201d\n\u201cSome of them I suppose\u201d said Tommy \u201care a little\u2014\u201d he hesitated\nfor a word \u201c\u2014a little\u2014\u201d his hand went slowly to his forehead but he\ndrew it away.",
    "\u201cI don\u2019t mean\u2014\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cOh I know perfectly what you mean\u201d said Miss Packard.",
    "\u201cWe\ndon\u2019t take mental patients you know but we do take what you might call\nborderline cases.",
    "I mean people who are rather senile\u2014can\u2019t look after\nthemselves properly or who have certain fancies and imaginations.",
    "Sometimes they imagine themselves to be historical personages.",
    "Quite in\na harmless way.",
    "We\u2019ve had two Marie Antoinettes here one of them was\nalways talking about something called the Petit Trianon and drinking a\nlot of milk which she seemed to associate with the place.",
    "And we had\none dear old soul who insisted that she was Madame Curie and that she\nhad discovered radium.",
    "She used to read the papers with great interest\nespecially any news of atomic bombs or scientific discoveries.",
    "Then she\n\n\falways explained it was she and her husband who had first started\nexperiments on these lines.",
    "Harmless delusions are things that manage to\nkeep you very happy when you\u2019re elderly.",
    "They don\u2019t usually last all the\ntime you know.",
    "You\u2019re not Marie Antoinette every day or even Madame\nCurie.",
    "Usually it comes on about once a fortnight.",
    "Then I suppose\npresumably one gets tired of keeping the playacting up.",
    "And of course\nmore often it\u2019s just forgetfulness that people suffer from.",
    "They can\u2019t\nquite remember who they are.",
    "Or they keep saying there\u2019s something\nvery important they\u2019ve forgotten and if they could only remember it.",
    "That sort of thing.\u201d\n\u201cI see\u201d said Tuppence.",
    "She hesitated and then said \u201cMrs.",
    "Lancaster\n\u2014Was it always things about that particular fireplace in the sitting room\nshe remembered or was it any fireplace\u201d\nMiss Packard stared\u2014\u201cA fireplace I don\u2019t understand what you\nmean.\u201d\n\u201cIt was something she said that I didn\u2019t understand\u2014Perhaps she\u2019d\nhad some unpleasant association with a fireplace or read some story that\nhad frightened her.\u201d\n\u201cPossibly.\u201d\nTuppence said \u201cI\u2019m still rather worried about the picture she gave to\nAunt Ada.\u201d\n\u201cI really don\u2019t think you need worry Mrs. Beresford.",
    "I expect she\u2019s\nforgotten all about it by now.",
    "I don\u2019t think she prized it particularly.",
    "She\nwas just pleased that Miss Fanshawe admired it and was glad for her to\nhave it and I\u2019m sure she\u2019d be glad for you to have it because you admire\nit.",
    "It\u2019s a nice picture I thought so myself.",
    "Not that I know much about\npictures.\u201d\n\u201cI tell you what I\u2019ll do.",
    "I\u2019ll write to Mrs. Johnson if you\u2019ll give me\nher address and just ask if it\u2019s all right to keep it.\u201d\n\u201cThe only address I\u2019ve got is the hotel in London they were going to\n\u2014the Cleveland I think it was called.",
    "Yes the Cleveland Hotel George\nStreet W1.",
    "She was taking Mrs. Lancaster there for about four or five\ndays and after that I think they were going to stay with some relations in\nScotland.",
    "I expect the Cleveland Hotel will have a forwarding address.\u201d\n\u201cWell thank you\u2014And now about this fur stole of Aunt Ada\u2019s.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cI\u2019ll go and bring Miss O\u2019Keefe to you.\u201d\nShe went out of the room.",
    "\u201cYou and your Mrs. Blenkensops\u201d said Tommy.",
    "Tuppence looked complacent.",
    "\u201cOne of my best creations\u201d she said.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m glad I was able to make\nuse of her\u2014I was just trying to think of a name and suddenly Mrs.\nBlenkensop came into my mind.",
    "What fun it was wasn\u2019t it\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a long time ago\u2014No more spies in wartime and counterespionage for us.\u201d\n\u201cMore\u2019s the pity.",
    "It was fun\u2014living in that guest house\u2014inventing a\nnew personality for myself\u2014I really began to believe I was Mrs.\nBlenkensop.\u201d\n\u201cYou were lucky you got away safely with it\u201d said Tommy \u201cand in\nmy opinion as I once told you you overdid it.\u201d\n\u201cI did not.",
    "I was perfectly in character.",
    "A nice woman rather silly\nand far too much taken up with her three sons.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I mean\u201d said Tommy.",
    "\u201cOne son would have been quite\nenough.",
    "Three sons were too much to burden yourself with.\u201d\n\u201cThey became quite real to me\u201d said Tuppence.",

    "\u201cI expect because they get so bored.",

    "BOOK 2\nTHE HOUSE\nON THE CANAL\n\n\fSeven\nTHE FRIENDLY WITCH\n\nBefore leaving the next morning Tuppence took a last careful look at\nthe picture hanging in her room not so much to fix its details firmly in\nher mind but to memorize its position in the landscape.",

    "The\nangle of approach would be quite different.",

    "With her she took a small overnight bag\nsince she would have a three hours\u2019 drive before she even arrived at the\narea of operations and after that it meant she judged a good deal of\nslow driving along country roads and lanes looking for likely canals.",
    "After stopping in Medchester for coffee and a snack she pushed on\nby a secondclass road adjacent to a railway line and leading through\nwooded country with plenty of streams.",
    "As in most of the rural districts of England signposts were plentiful\nbearing names that Tuppence had never heard of and seldom seeming to\nlead to the place in question.",
    "There seemed to be a certain cunning about\nthis part of the road system of England.",
    "The road would twist off from\nthe canal and when you pressed on hopefully to where you thought the\n\n\fcanal might have taken itself you drew a blank.",
    "If you had gone in the\ndirection of Great Michelden the next signpost you came to offered you\na choice of two roads one to Pennington Sparrow and the other to\nFarlingford.",
    "You chose Farlingford and managed actually to get to such a\nplace but almost immediately the next signpost sent you back firmly to\nMedchester so that you practically retraced your steps.",
    "Actually\nTuppence never did find Great Michelden and for a long time she was\nquite unable to find the lost canal.",
    "If she had had any idea of which\nvillage she was looking for things might have gone more easily.",
    "Tracking canals on maps was merely puzzling.",
    "Now and again she came\nto the railway which cheered her up and she would then push on\nhopefully for Bees Hill South Winterton and Farrell St. Edmund.",
    "Farrell\nSt. Edmund had once had a station but it had been abolished some time\nago \u201cIf only\u201d thought Tuppence \u201cthere was some wellbehaved road\nthat ran alongside a canal or alongside a railway line it would make it\nso much easier.\u201d\nThe day wore on and Tuppence became more and more baffled.",
    "Occasionally she came upon a farm adjacent to a canal but the road\nhaving led to the farm insisted on having nothing more to do with the\ncanal and went over a hill and arrived at something called Westpenfold\nwhich had a church with a square tower which was no use at all.",
    "From there when disconsolately pursuing a rutted road which seemed\nthe only way out of Westpenfold and which to Tuppence\u2019s sense of\ndirection which was now becoming increasingly unreliable seemed to\nlead in the opposite direction to anywhere she could possibly want to go\nshe came abruptly to a place where two lanes forked right and left.",
    "There\nwas the remains of a signpost between them the arms of which had both\nbroken off.",
    "\u201cWhich way\u201d said Tuppence.",
    "\u201cWho knows I don\u2019t.\u201d\nShe took the lefthand one.",
    "It meandered on winding to left and to right.",
    "Finally it shot round a\nbend widened out and climbed a hill coming out of woods into open\ndownlike country.",
    "Having surmounted the crest it took a steep downward\ncourse.",
    "Not very far away a plaintive cry sounded\u2014\n\u201cSounds like a train\u201d said Tuppence with sudden hope.",
    "It was a train\u2014Then below her was the railway line and on it a goods\ntrain uttering cries of distress as it puffed along.",
    "And beyond it was the\ncanal and on the other side of the canal was a house that Tuppence\nrecognized and leading across the canal was a small humpbacked pinkbricked bridge.",
    "The road dipped under the railway came up and made\nfor the bridge.",
    "Tuppence drove very gently over the narrow bridge.",
    "Beyond it the road went on with the house on the righthand side of it.",
    "Tuppence drove on looking for the way in.",
    "There didn\u2019t seem to be one.",
    "A fairly high wall shielded it from the road.",
    "The house was on her right now.",
    "She stopped the car and walked\nback on to the bridge and looked at what she could see of the house from\nthere.",
    "Most of the tall windows were shuttered with green shutters.",
    "The\nhouse had a very quiet and empty look.",
    "It looked peaceful and kindly in\nthe setting sun.",
    "There was nothing to suggest that anyone lived in it.",
    "She\nwent back to the car and drove a little farther.",
    "The wall a moderately\nhigh one ran along to her right.",
    "The lefthand side of the road was\nmerely a hedge giving on green fields.",
    "Presently she came to a wroughtiron gate in the wall.",
    "She parked the\ncar by the side of the road got out and went over to look through the\nironwork of the gate.",
    "By standing on tiptoe she could look over it.",
    "What\nshe looked into was a garden.",
    "The place was certainly not a farm now\nthough it might have been once.",
    "Presumably it gave on fields beyond it.",
    "The garden was tended and cultivated.",
    "It was not particularly tidy but it\nlooked as though someone was trying rather unsuccessfully to keep it\ntidy.",
    "From the iron gate a circular path curved through the garden and\nround to the house.",
    "This must be presumably the front door though it\ndidn\u2019t look like a front door.",
    "It was inconspicuous though sturdy\u2014a back\ndoor.",
    "The house looked quite different from this side.",
    "To begin with it\nwas not empty.",
    "People lived there.",
    "Windows were open curtains\nfluttered at them a garbage pail stood by the door.",
    "At the far end of the\ngarden Tuppence could see a large man digging a big elderly man who\ndug slowly and with persistence.",
    "Certainly looked at from here the house\nheld no enchantment no artist would have wanted particularly to paint it.",
    "It was just a house and somebody lived in it.",
    "Tuppence wondered.",
    "She\nhesitated.",
    "Should she go on and forget the house altogether No she\ncould hardly do that not after all the trouble she had taken.",
    "What time\nwas it She looked at her watch but her watch had stopped.",
    "The sound of\na door opening came from inside.",
    "She peered through the gate again.",
    "The door of the house had opened and a woman came out.",
    "She put\ndown a milk bottle and then straightening up glanced towards the gate.",
    "She saw Tuppence and hesitated for a moment and then seeming to\nmake up her mind she came down the path towards the gate.",
    "\u201cWhy\u201d\nsaid Tuppence to herself \u201cwhy it\u2019s a friendly witch\u201d\nIt was a woman of about fifty.",
    "She had long straggly hair which when\ncaught by the wind flew out behind her.",
    "It reminded Tuppence vaguely\nof a picture by Nevinson of a young witch on a broomstick.",
    "That is\nperhaps why the term witch had come into her mind.",
    "But there was\nnothing young or beautiful about this woman.",
    "She was middleaged with\na lined face dressed in a rather slipshod way.",
    "She had a kind of steeple\nhat perched on her head and her nose and her chin came up towards each\nother.",
    "As a description she could have been sinister but she did not look\nsinister.",
    "She seemed to have a beaming and boundless good will.",
    "\u201cYes\u201d\nthought Tuppence \u201cyou\u2019re exactly like a witch but you\u2019re a friendly\nwitch.",
    "I expect you\u2019re what they used to call a \u2018white witch.\u2019 \u201d\nThe woman came down in a hesitating manner to the gate and spoke.",

    "It\u2019s\nmonstrous suggesting anything of the kind.\u201d\n\u201cThe poor fellow seems very upset\u201d said the vicar.",
    "\u201cA sad history\naltogether so far as I can make out.",
    "But I mustn\u2019t keep you.\u201d\nTuppence thought to herself as she was shepherded by Miss Bligh\nthat no matter what the reputation of Mrs. Copleigh for talking she could\nhardly talk more than Miss Bligh did.",
    "A stream of pronouncements both\nrapid and dictatorial poured from her lips.",
    "Mrs. Copleigh\u2019s cottage proved to be a pleasant and roomy one set\nback from the village street with a neat garden of flowers in front a\nwhitened doorstep and a brass handle well polished.",
    "Mrs. Copleigh\nherself seemed to Tuppence like a character straight out of the pages of\nDickens.",
    "She was very small and very round so that she came rolling\n\n\ftowards you rather like a rubber ball.",
    "She had bright twinkling eyes\nblonde hair rolled up in sausage curls on her head and an air of\ntremendous vigour.",
    "After displaying a little doubt to begin with\u2014\u201cWell\nI don\u2019t usually you know.",
    "No.",
    "My husband and I say \u2018summer visitors\nthat\u2019s different.\u2019 Everyone does that if they can nowadays.",
    "And have to\nI\u2019m sure.",
    "But not this time of year so much we don\u2019t.",
    "Not until July.",
    "However if it\u2019s just for a few days and the lady wouldn\u2019t mind things\nbeing a bit rough perhaps\u2014\u201d\nTuppence said she didn\u2019t mind things being rough and Mrs.\nCopleigh having surveyed her with close attention whilst not stopping\nher flow of conversation said perhaps the lady would like to come up\nand see the room and then things might be arranged.",
    "At that point Miss Bligh tore herself away with some regret because\nshe had not so far been able to extract all the information she wanted\nfrom Tuppence as to where she came from what her husband did how\nold she was if she had any children and other matters of interest.",
    "But it\nappeared that she had a meeting at her house over which she was going\nto preside and was terrified at the risk that someone else might seize that\ncoveted post.",
    "\u201cYou\u2019ll be quite all right with Mrs. Copleigh\u201d she assured Tuppence\n\u201cshe\u2019ll look after you I\u2019m sure.",
    "Now what about your car\u201d\n\u201cOh I\u2019ll fetch it presently\u201d said Tuppence.",
    "\u201cMrs.",
    "Copleigh will tell\nme where I had better put it.",
    "I can leave it outside here really because it\nisn\u2019t a very narrow street is it\u201d\n\u201cOh my husband can do better than that for you\u201d said Mrs.\nCopleigh.",
    "\u201cHe\u2019ll put it in the field for you.",
    "Just round the side lane here\nand it\u2019ll be quite all right there.",
    "There\u2019s a shed he can drive it into.\u201d\nThings were arranged amicably on that basis and Miss Bligh hurried\naway to her appointment.",
    "The question of an evening meal was next\nraised.",
    "Tuppence asked if there was a pub in the village.",
    "\u201cOh we have nothing as a lady could go to\u201d said Mrs. Copleigh\n\u201cbut if you\u2019d be satisfied with a couple of eggs and a slice of ham and\nmaybe some bread and homemade jam\u2014\u201d\nTuppence said that would be splendid.",
    "Her room was small but\ncheerful and pleasant with a rosebud wallpaper and a comfortable\n\n\flooking bed and a general air of spotless cleanliness.",
    "\u201cYes it\u2019s a nice wallpaper miss\u201d said Mrs. Copleigh who seemed\ndetermined to accord Tuppence single status.",
    "\u201cChose it we did so that\nany newly married couple should come here on honeymoon.",
    "Romantic\nif you know what I mean.\u201d\nTuppence agreed that romance was a very desirable thing.",
    "\u201cThey haven\u2019t got so much to spend nowadays newly marrieds.",
    "Not\nwhat they used to.",
    "Most of them you see are saving for a house or are\nmaking down payments already.",
    "Or they\u2019ve got to buy some furniture on\nthe hire purchase and it doesn\u2019t leave anything over for having a posh\nhoneymoon or anything of that kind.",
    "They\u2019re careful you know most of\nthe young folk.",
    "They don\u2019t go bashing all their money.\u201d\nShe clattered downstairs again talking briskly as she went.",
    "Tuppence\nlay down on the bed to have half an hour\u2019s sleep after a somewhat tiring\nday.",
    "She had however great hopes of Mrs. Copleigh and felt that once\nthoroughly rested herself she would be able to lead the conversation to\nthe most fruitful subjects possible.",
    "She would hear she was sure all\nabout the house by the bridge who had lived there who had been of evil\nor good repute in the neighbourhood what scandals there were and other\nsuch likely topics.",
    "She was more convinced of this than ever when she\nhad been introduced to Mr. Copleigh a man who barely opened his\nmouth.",
    "His conversation was mostly made up of amiable grunts usually\nsignifying an affirmative.",
    "Sometimes in more muted tones a\ndisagreement.",
    "He was content so far as Tuppence could see to let his wife talk.",
    "He\nhimself more or less abstracted his attention part of the time busy with\nhis plans for the next day which appeared to be market day.",
    "As far as Tuppence was concerned nothing could have turned out\nbetter.",
    "It could have been distinguished by a slogan\u2014\u201cYou want\ninformation we have it.\u201d Mrs. Copleigh was as good as a wireless set or\na television.",
    "You had only to turn the button and words poured out\naccompanied by gestures and lots of facial expression.",
    "Not only was her\nfigure like a child\u2019s rubber ball her face might also have been made of\nindia rubber.",
    "The various people she was talking about almost came alive\nin caricature before Tuppence\u2019s eyes.",
    "Tuppence ate bacon and eggs and had slices of thick bread and butter\nand praised the blackberry jelly homemade her favourite kind she\ntruthfully announced and did her best to absorb the flood of information\nso that she could write notes down in her notebook later.",
    "A whole\npanorama of the past in this country district seemed to be spread out\nbefore her.",
    "There was no chronological sequence which occasionally made\nthings difficult.",
    "Mrs. Copleigh jumped from fifteen years ago to two\nyears ago to last month and then back to somewhere in the twenties.",
    "All\nthis would want a lot of sorting out.",
    "And Tuppence wondered whether in\nthe end she would get anything.",
    "The first button she had pressed had not given her any result.",
    "That\nwas a mention of Mrs. Lancaster.",
    "\u201cI think she came from hereabouts\u201d said Tuppence allowing a good\ndeal of vagueness to appear in her voice.",
    "\u201cShe had a picture\u2014a very nice\npicture done by an artist who I believe was known down here.\u201d\n\u201cWho did you say now\u201d\n\u201cA Mrs. Lancaster.\u201d\n\u201cNo I don\u2019t remember any Lancasters in these parts.",
    "Lancaster.",
    "Lancaster.",
    "A gentleman had a car accident I remember.",
    "No it\u2019s the car\nI\u2019m thinking of.",
    "A Lancaster that was.",
    "No Mrs. Lancaster.",
    "It wouldn\u2019t be\nMiss Bolton would it She\u2019d be about seventy now I think.",
    "She might\nhave married a Mr. Lancaster.",
    "She went away and travelled abroad and I\ndo hear she married someone.\u201d\n\u201cThe picture she gave my aunt was by a Mr. Boscobel\u2014I think the\nname was\u201d said Tuppence.",
    "\u201cWhat a lovely jelly.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t put no apple in it either like most people do.",
    "Makes it jell\nbetter they say but it takes all the flavour out.\u201d\n\u201cYes\u201d said Tuppence.",
    "\u201cI quite agree with you.",
    "It does.\u201d\n\u201cWho did you say now It began with a B but I didn\u2019t quite catch it.\u201d\n\u201cBoscobel I think.\u201d\n\u201cOh I remember Mr. Boscowan well.",
    "Let\u2019s see now.",
    "That must have\nbeen\u2014fifteen years ago it was at least that he came down here.",
    "He came\nseveral years running he did.",
    "He liked the place.",
    "Actually rented a\ncottage.",
    "One of Farmer Hart\u2019s cottages it was that he kept for his\n\n\flabourer.",
    "But they built a new one they did the Council.",
    "Four new\ncottages specially for labourers.",
    "\u201cRegular artist Mr. B was\u201d said Mrs. Copleigh.",
    "\u201cFunny kind of coat\nhe used to wear.",
    "Sort of velvet or corduroy.",

    "Oh very colourful\nhe was.",
    "I liked his pictures I did.",
    "He had a showing of them one year.",
    "Round about Christmas time it was I think.",
    "No of course not it must\nhave been in the summer.",
    "He wasn\u2019t here in the winter.",
    "Yes very nice.",
    "Nothing exciting if you know what I mean.",
    "Just a house with a couple of\ntrees or two cows looking over a fence.",
    "But all nice and quiet and pretty\ncolours.",
    "Not like some of these young chaps nowadays.\u201d\n\u201cDo you have a lot of artists down here\u201d\n\u201cNot really.",
    "Oh no not to speak of.",
    "One or two ladies comes down in\nthe summer and does sketching sometimes but I don\u2019t think much of\nthem.",
    "We had a young fellow a year ago called himself an artist.",
    "Didn\u2019t\nshave properly.",
    "I can\u2019t say I liked any of his pictures much.",
    "Funny\ncolours all swirled round anyhow.",
    "Nothing you could recognize a bit.",
    "Sold a lot of his pictures he did at that.",
    "And they weren\u2019t cheap mind\nyou.\u201d\n\u201cOught to have been five pounds\u201d said Mr. Copleigh entering the\nconversation for the first time so suddenly that Tuppence jumped.",
    "\u201cWhat my husband thinks is\u201d said Mrs. Copleigh resuming her\nplace as interpreter to him.",
    "\u201cHe thinks no picture ought to cost more than\nfive pounds.",
    "Paints wouldn\u2019t cost as much as that.",
    "That\u2019s what he says\ndon\u2019t you George\u201d\n\u201cAh\u201d said George.",
    "\u201cMr.",
    "Boscowan painted a picture of that house by the bridge and the\ncanal\u2014Waterside or Watermead isn\u2019t it called I came that way today.\u201d\n\u201cOh you came along that road did you It\u2019s not much of a road is\nit Very narrow.",

    "She looks mad all right.",
    "All that\nscatty hair flying about.",

    "There\u2019s all sorts of tales about her but then there\u2019s always tales.\u201d\n\u201cWhat sort of tales\u201d\nDirect questions were never resented by Mrs. Copleigh who\nwelcomed them as one who was only too eager to answer.",
    "\u201cCalls up spirits they say at night.",
    "Sitting round a table.",

    "This\ngentlemen he used to come down and see her and the story goes that\nthey had a quarrel and he cut her throat one night.\u201d\n\u201cHow terrible\u201d said Tuppence.",
    "\u201cDid they hang him for it\u201d\n\u201cNo.",
    "Oh no there was nothing of that sort.",
    "The story is you see that\nhe had to get rid of the body and he walled her up in the fireplace.\u201d\n\u201cWalled her up in the fireplace\u201d\n\u201cSome ways they tell it they say she was a nun and she had run\naway from a convent and that\u2019s why she had to be walled up.",

    "Gone away to\nlive in town or back to some other place.",
    "People used to hear noises and\nsee lights in the house and a lot of people don\u2019t go near it after dark.\u201d\n\u201cBut what happened later\u201d said Tuppence feeling that to go back\nbeyond the reign of Queen Victoria seemed a little too far into the past\nfor what she was looking for.",
    "\u201cWell I don\u2019t rightly know as there was very much.",
    "A farmer called\nBlodgick took it over when it came up for sale I believe.",
    "He weren\u2019t\nthere long either.",
    "What they called a gentleman farmer.",
    "That\u2019s why he\nliked the house I suppose but the farming land wasn\u2019t much use to him\nand he didn\u2019t know how to deal with it.",
    "So he sold it again.",
    "Changed\nhands ever so many times it has\u2014Always builders coming along and\nmaking alterations\u2014new bathrooms\u2014that sort of thing\u2014A couple had it\n\n\fwho were doing chicken farming I believe at one time.",
    "But it got a\nname you know for being unlucky.",

    "I\nbelieve Mr. Boscowan himself thought of buying it at one time.",
    "That was\nwhen he painted the picture of it.\u201d\n\u201cWhat sort of age was Mr. Boscowan when he was down here\u201d\n\u201cForty I would say or maybe a bit more than that.",
    "He was a goodlooking man in his way.",
    "Run into fat a bit though.",
    "Great one for the\ngirls he was.\u201d\n\u201cAh\u201d said Mr. Copleigh.",

    "I\ncan see now\u2014It started when a nice but addleheaded old pussy got a bit\nmixed up in her head and began reminiscing about stories this Mr.\nBoscowan or someone like him who may have given the picture to her\ntold about the house and the legends about it of someone being walled\nup alive in a fireplace and she thought it was a child for some reason.",
    "And here I am going round investigating mares\u2019 nests.",
    "Tommy told me I\nwas a fool and he was quite right\u2014I am a fool.\u201d\nShe waited for a break to occur in Mrs. Copleigh\u2019s even flow of\nconversation so that she could rise say good night politely and go\nupstairs to bed.",
    "Mrs. Copleigh was still in full and happy spate.",
    "\u201cMrs.",

    "My wife says\nnobody ever lived in that house\u2014the one I brought in.",
    "I see now what\nshe meant.",
    "I don\u2019t see that anybody was attending service in that church\nor ever will.\u201d\n\u201cWell perhaps your wife\u2019s got something.",
    "Quiet peaceful dwellings\nwith no human occupancy.",
    "He didn\u2019t often paint people you know.",
    "Sometimes there\u2019s a figure or two in the landscape but more often not.",
    "In a way I think that gives them their special charm.",
    "A sort of isolationist\nfeeling.",
    "It was as though he removed all the human beings and the peace\nof the countryside was all the better without them.",
    "Come to think of it\nthat\u2019s maybe why the general taste has swung round to him.",
    "Too many\npeople nowadays too many cars too many noises on the road too much\nnoise and bustle.",
    "Peace perfect peace.",
    "Leave it all to Nature.\u201d\n\u201cYes I shouldn\u2019t wonder.",
    "What sort of a man was he\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know him personally.",
    "Before my time.",
    "Pleased with himself\nby all accounts.",
    "Thought he was a better painter than he was probably.",
    "Put on a bit of side.",
    "Kindly quite likeable.",
    "Eye for the girls.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you\u2019ve no idea where this particular piece of countryside\nexists It is England I suppose.\u201d\n\u201cI should think so yes.",
    "Do you want me to find out for you\u201d\n\u201cCould you\u201d\n\u201cProbably the best thing to do would be to ask his wife his widow\nrather.",
    "He married Emma Wing the sculptor.",
    "Well known.",
    "Not very\n\n\fproductive.",
    "Does quite powerful work.",
    "You could go and ask her.",

    "Is she an artist or something of\nthe kind\u201d\n\u201cNo I don\u2019t think so.",
    "She\u2019s just an old lady living for the last few\nyears in an old ladies\u2019 home.",
    "She comes into it because this picture\nbelonged to her until she gave it away to an aunt of mine.\u201d\n\u201cWell I can\u2019t say the name means anything to me.",
    "Better go and talk\nto Mrs. Boscowan.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s she like\u201d\n\u201cShe was a good bit younger than he was I should say.",
    "Quite a\npersonality.\u201d He nodded his head once or twice.",
    "\u201cYes quite a personality.",

    "My blood pressure is so good that it\ndisappoints every doctor to whom I submit it.\u201d\n\u201cThen what do you want to see a doctor for\u201d\n\u201cOh\u201d said Tommy cheerfully\u2014\u201cI\u2019ve just got to see a doctor about a\nbody.",
    "Thanks for your help.",
    "Goodbye.\u201d\n\nII\nTommy greeted Dr. Murray with some curiosity\u2014He presumed it was\nsome formal matter to do with Aunt Ada\u2019s decease but why on earth Dr.\nMurray would not at least mention the subject of his visit over the\ntelephone Tommy couldn\u2019t imagine.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019m a little late\u201d said Dr. Murray shaking hands \u201cbut the\ntraffic was pretty bad and I wasn\u2019t exactly sure of the locality.",
    "I don\u2019t\nknow this part of London very well.\u201d\n\u201cWell too bad you had to come all the way here\u201d said Tommy.",
    "\u201cI\ncould have met you somewhere more convenient you know.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve time on your hands then just now\u201d\n\u201cJust at the moment yes.",
    "I\u2019ve been away for the last week.\u201d\n\u201cYes I believe someone told me so when I rang up.\u201d\nTommy indicated a chair suggested refreshment placed cigarettes\nand matches by Dr. Murray\u2019s side.",
    "When the two men had established\nthemselves comfortably Dr. Murray opened the conversation.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019ve aroused your curiosity\u201d he said \u201cbut as a matter of\nfact we\u2019re in a spot of trouble at Sunny Ridge.",
    "It\u2019s a difficult and\nperplexing matter and in one way it\u2019s nothing to do with you.",
    "I\u2019ve no\nearthly right to trouble you with it but there\u2019s just an off chance that you\nmight know something which would help me.\u201d\n\u201cWell of course I\u2019ll do anything I can.",
    "Something to do with my\naunt Miss Fanshawe\u201d\n\u201cNot directly no.",
    "But in a way she does come into it.",
    "I can speak to\nyou in confidence can\u2019t I Mr. Beresford\u201d\n\u201cYes certainly.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cAs a matter of fact I was talking the other day to a mutual friend of\nours.",
    "He was telling me a few things about you.",
    "I gather that in the last\nwar you had rather a delicate assignment.\u201d\n\u201cOh I wouldn\u2019t put it quite as seriously as that\u201d said Tommy in his\nmost noncommittal manner.",
    "\u201cOh no I quite realize that it\u2019s not a thing to be talked about.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t really think that matters nowadays.",
    "It\u2019s a good long time\nsince the war.",
    "My wife and I were younger then.\u201d\n\u201cAnyway it\u2019s nothing to do with that that I want to talk to you\nabout but at least I feel that I can speak frankly to you that I can trust\nyou not to repeat what I am now saying though it\u2019s possible that it all\nmay have to come out later.\u201d\n\u201cA spot of trouble at Sunny Ridge you say\u201d\n\u201cYes.",
    "Not very long ago one of our patients died.",
    "A Mrs. Moody.",
    "I\ndon\u2019t know if you ever met her or if your aunt ever talked about her.\u201d\n\u201cMrs.",
    "Moody\u201d Tommy reflected.",
    "\u201cNo I don\u2019t think so.",
    "Anyway not\nso far as I remember.\u201d\n\u201cShe was not one of our older patients.",
    "She was still on the right side\nof seventy and she was not seriously ill in any way.",
    "It was just a case of a\nwoman with no near relatives and no one to look after her in the\ndomestic line.",
    "She fell into the category of what I often call to myself a\nflutterer.",
    "Women who more and more resemble hens as they grow older.",
    "They cluck.",
    "They forget things.",
    "They run themselves into difficulties and\nthey worry.",
    "They get themselves wrought up about nothing at all.",
    "There\nis very little the matter with them.",
    "They are not strictly speaking\nmentally disturbed.\u201d\n\u201cBut they just cluck\u201d Tommy suggested.",
    "\u201cAs you say.",
    "Mrs. Moody clucked.",
    "She caused the nurses a fair\namount of trouble although they were quite fond of her.",
    "She had a habit\nof forgetting when she\u2019d had her meals making a fuss because no dinner\nhad been served to her when as a matter of fact she had actually just\neaten a very good dinner.\u201d\n\u201cOh\u201d said Tommy enlightened \u201cMrs.",
    "Cocoa.\u201d\n\u201cI beg your pardon\u201d\n\n\f\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d said Tommy \u201cit\u2019s a name my wife and I had for her.",
    "She\nwas yelling for Nurse Jane one day when we passed along the passage\nand saying she hadn\u2019t had her cocoa.",
    "Rather a nicelooking scatty little\nwoman.",
    "But it made us both laugh and we fell into the habit of calling\nher Mrs. Cocoa.",
    "And so she\u2019s died.\u201d\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t particularly surprised when the death happened\u201d said Dr.\nMurray.",
    "\u201cTo be able to prophesy with any exactitude when elderly\nwomen will die is practically impossible.",
    "Women whose health is\nseriously affected who one feels as a result of physical examination\nwill hardly last the year out sometimes are good for another ten years.",
    "They have a tenacious hold on life which mere physical disability will\nnot quench.",
    "There are other people whose health is reasonably good and\nwho may one thinks make old bones.",
    "They on the other hand catch\nbronchitis or \u2019flu seem unable to have the stamina to recuperate from it\nand die with surprising ease.",
    "So as I say as a medical attendant to an\nelderly ladies\u2019 home I am not surprised when what might be called a\nfairly unexpected death occurs.",
    "This case of Mrs. Moody however was\nsomewhat different.",
    "She died in her sleep without having exhibited any\nsign of illness and I could not help feeling that in my opinion her death\nwas unexpected.",
    "I will use the phrase that has always intrigued me in\nShakespeare\u2019s play Macbeth.",
    "I have always wondered what Macbeth\nmeant when he said of his wife \u2018She should have died hereafter.\u2019 \u201d\n\u201cYes I remember wondering once myself what Shakespeare was\ngetting at\u201d said Tommy.",
    "\u201cI forget whose production it was and who was\nplaying Macbeth but there was a strong suggestion in that particular\nproduction and Macbeth certainly played it in a way to suggest that he\nwas hinting to the medical attendant that Lady Macbeth would be better\nout of the way.",
    "Presumably the medical attendant took the hint.",
    "It was\nthen that Macbeth feeling safe after his wife\u2019s death feeling that she\ncould no longer damage him by her indiscretions or her rapidly failing\nmind expresses his genuine affection and grief for her.",
    "\u2018She should have\ndied hereafter.\u2019 \u201d\n\u201cExactly\u201d said Dr. Murray.",
    "\u201cIt is what I felt about Mrs. Moody.",
    "I felt\nthat she should have died hereafter.",
    "Not just three weeks ago of no\napparent cause\u2014\u201d\n\n\fTommy did not reply.",
    "He merely looked at the doctor inquiringly.",
    "\u201cMedical men have certain problems.",
    "If you are puzzled over the\ncause of a patient\u2019s death there is only one sure way to tell.",
    "By a\npostmortem.",
    "Postmortems are not appreciated by relatives of the\ndeceased but if a doctor demands a postmortem and the result is as it\nperfectly well may be a case of natural causes or some disease or\nmalady which does not always give outward signs or symptoms then the\ndoctor\u2019s career can be quite seriously affected by his having made a\nquestionable diagnosis\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI can see that it must have been difficult.\u201d\n\u201cThe relatives in question are distant cousins.",
    "So I took it upon\nmyself to get their consent as it was a matter of medical interest to know\nthe cause of death.",
    "When a patient dies in her sleep it is advisable to add\nto one\u2019s medical knowledge.",
    "I wrapped it up a good bit mind you didn\u2019t\nmake it too formal.",
    "Luckily they couldn\u2019t care less.",
    "I felt very relieved in\nmind.",
    "Once the autopsy had been performed and if all was well I could\ngive a death certificate without a qualm.",
    "Anyone can die of what is\namateurishly called heart failure from one of several different causes.",
    "Actually Mrs. Moody\u2019s heart was in really very good shape for her age.",
    "She suffered from arthritis and rheumatism and occasional trouble with\nher liver but none of these things seemed to accord with her passing\naway in her sleep.\u201d\nDr. Murray came to a stop.",
    "Tommy opened his lips and then shut\nthem again.",
    "The doctor nodded.",
    "\u201cYes Mr. Beresford.",
    "You can see where I am tending.",
    "Death has\nresulted from an overdose of morphine.\u201d\n\u201cGood Lord\u201d Tommy stared and the ejaculation escaped him.",
    "\u201cYes.",
    "It seemed quite incredible but there was no getting away from\nthe analysis.",
    "The question was How was that morphia administered\nShe was not on morphia.",
    "She was not a patient who suffered pain.",
    "There\nwere three possibilities of course.",
    "She might have taken it by accident.",
    "Unlikely.",
    "She might have got hold of some other patient\u2019s medicine by\nmistake but that again is not particularly likely.",
    "Patients are not entrusted\nwith supplies of morphia and we do not accept drug addicts who might\nhave a supply of such things in their possession.",
    "It could have been\n\n\fdeliberate suicide but I should be very slow to accept that.",
    "Mrs. Moody\nthough a worrier was of a perfectly cheerful disposition and I am quite\nsure had never thought of ending her life.",
    "The third possibility is that a\nfatal overdose was deliberately administered to her.",
    "But by whom and\nwhy Naturally there are supplies of morphia and other drugs which\nMiss Packard as a registered hospital nurse and matron is perfectly\nentitled to have in her possession and which she keeps in a locked\ncupboard.",
    "In such cases as sciatica or rheumatoid arthritis there can be\nsuch severe and desperate pain that morphia is occasionally\nadministered.",
    "We have hoped that we may come across some\ncircumstance in which Mrs. Moody had a dangerous amount of morphia\nadministered to her by mistake or which she herself took under the\ndelusion that it was a cure for indigestion or insomnia.",
    "We have not been\nable to find any such circumstances possible.",
    "The next thing we have\ndone at Miss Packard\u2019s suggestion and I agreed with her is to look\ncarefully into the records of such deaths as have taken place at Sunny\nRidge in the last two years.",
    "There have not been many of them I am glad\nto say.",
    "I think seven in all which is a pretty fair average for people of\nthat age group.",
    "Two deaths of bronchitis perfectly straightforward two\nof flu always a possible killer during the winter months owing to the\nslight resistance offered by frail elderly women.",
    "And three others.\u201d\nHe paused and said \u201cMr.",
    "Beresford I am not satisfied about those\nthree others certainly not about two of them.",
    "They were perfectly\nprobable they were not unexpected but I will go as far as saying that\nthey were unlikely.",
    "They are not cases that on reflection and research I\nam entirely satisfied about.",
    "One has to accept the possibility that\nunlikely as it seems there is someone at Sunny Ridge who is possibly\nfor mental reasons a killer.",
    "An entirely unsuspected killer.\u201d\nThere was silence for some moments.",
    "Tommy gave a sigh.",
    "\u201cI don\u2019t doubt what you\u2019ve told me\u201d he said \u201cbut all the same\nfrankly it seems unbelievable.",
    "These things\u2014surely they can\u2019t happen.\u201d\n\u201cOh yes\u201d said Dr. Murray grimly \u201cthey happen all right.",
    "You go\nover some of the pathological cases.",
    "A woman who took on domestic\nservice.",
    "She worked as a cook in various households.",
    "She was a nice\nkind pleasantseeming woman gave her employers faithful service\n\n\fcooked well enjoyed being with them.",
    "Yet sooner or later things\nhappened.",
    "Usually a plate of sandwiches.",
    "Sometimes picnic food.",
    "For no\napparent motive arsenic was added.",
    "Two or three poisoned sandwiches\namong the rest.",
    "Apparently sheer chance dictated who took and ate them.",
    "There seemed no personal venom.",
    "Sometimes no tragedy happened.",
    "The\nsame woman was three or four months in a situation and there was no\ntrace of illness.",
    "Nothing.",
    "Then she left to go to another job and in that\nnext job within three weeks two of the family died after eating bacon\nfor breakfast.",
    "The fact that all these things happened in different parts of\nEngland and at irregular intervals made it some time before the police\ngot on her track.",
    "She used a different name of course each time.",
    "But\nthere are so many pleasant capable middleaged women who can cook\nit was hard to find out which particular woman it was.\u201d\n\u201cWhy did she do it\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anybody has ever really known.",
    "There have been\nseveral different theories especially of course by psychologists.",
    "She was\na somewhat religious woman and it seems possible that some form of\nreligious insanity made her feel that she had a divine command to rid the\nworld of certain people but it does not seem that she herself had borne\nthem any personal animus.",
    "\u201cThen there was the French woman Jeanne Gebron who was called\nThe Angel of Mercy.",
    "She was so upset when her neighbours had ill\nchildren she hurried to nurse those children.",
    "Sat devotedly at their\nbedside.",
    "There again it was some time before people discovered that the\nchildren she nursed never recovered.",
    "Instead they all died.",
    "And why It\nis true that when she was young her own child died.",
    "She appeared to be\nprostrated with grief.",
    "Perhaps that was the cause of her career of crime.",
    "If her child died so should the children of other women.",
    "Or it may be as\nsome thought that her own child was also one of the victims.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re giving me chills down my spine\u201d said Tommy.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m taking the most melodramatic examples\u201d said the doctor.",
    "\u201cIt\nmay be something much simpler than that.",
    "You remember in the case of\nArmstrong anyone who had in any way offended him or insulted him or\nindeed if he even thought anyone had insulted him that person was\nquickly asked to tea and given arsenic sandwiches.",
    "A sort of intensified\n\n\ftouchiness.",
    "His first crimes were obviously mere crimes for personal\nadvantage.",
    "Inheriting of money.",
    "The removal of a wife so that he could\nmarry another woman.",
    "\u201cThen there was Nurse Warriner who kept a Home for elderly\npeople.",
    "They made over what means they had to her and were\nguaranteed a comfortable old age until death came\u2014But death did not\ndelay very long.",
    "There too it was morphia that was administered\u2014a\nvery kindly woman but with no scruples\u2014she regarded herself I\nbelieve as a benefactor.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve no idea if your surmise about these deaths is true who it\ncould be\u201d\n\u201cNo.",
    "There seems no pointer of any kind.",
    "Taking the view that the\nkiller is probably insane insanity is a very difficult thing to recognize in\nsome of its manifestations.",
    "Is it somebody shall we say who dislikes\nelderly people who had been injured or has had her life ruined or so she\nthinks by somebody elderly Or is it possibly someone who has her own\nideas of mercy killing and thinks that everyone over sixty years of age\nshould be kindly exterminated.",
    "It could be anyone of course.",
    "A patient\nOr a member of the staff\u2014a nurse or a domestic worker\n\u201cI have discussed this at great length with Millicent Packard who\nruns the place.",
    "She is a highly competent woman shrewd businesslike\nwith keen supervision both of the guests there and of her own staff.",
    "She\ninsists that she has no suspicion and no clue whatever and I am sure that\nis perfectly true.\u201d\n\u201cBut why come to me What can I do\u201d\n\u201cYour aunt Miss Fanshawe was a resident there for some years\u2014\nshe was a woman of very considerable mental capacity though she often\npretended otherwise.",
    "She had unconventional ways of amusing herself\nby putting on an appearance of senility.",
    "But she was actually very much\nall there\u2014What I want you to try and do Mr. Beresford is to think hard\n\u2014you and your wife too\u2014Is there anything you can remember that\nMiss Fanshawe ever said or hinted that might give us a clue\u2014\nSomething she had seen or noticed something that someone had told her\nsomething that she herself had thought peculiar.",
    "Old ladies see and notice\na lot and a really shrewd one like Miss Fanshawe would know a\n\n\fsurprising amount of what went on in a place like Sunny Ridge.",
    "These\nold ladies are not busy you see they have all the time in the world to\nlook around them and make deductions\u2014and even jump to conclusions\n\u2014that may seem fantastic but are sometimes surprisingly entirely\ncorrect.\u201d\nTommy shook his head.",
    "\u201cI know what you mean\u2014But I can\u2019t remember anything of that\nkind.\u201d\n\u201cYour wife\u2019s away from home I gather.",
    "You don\u2019t think she might\nremember something that hadn\u2019t struck you\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll ask her\u2014but I doubt it.\u201d He hesitated then made up his mind.",
    "\u201cLook here there was something that worried my wife\u2014about one of the\nold ladies a Mrs. Lancaster.\u201d\n\u201cMrs.",
    "Lancaster Yes\u201d\n\u201cMy wife\u2019s got it into her head that Mrs. Lancaster has been taken\naway by some socalled relations very suddenly.",
    "As a matter of fact\nMrs. Lancaster gave a picture to my aunt as a present and my wife felt\nthat she ought to offer to return the picture to Mrs. Lancaster so she tried\nto get in touch with her to know if Mrs. Lancaster would like the picture\nreturned to her.\u201d\n\u201cWell that was very thoughtful of Mrs. Beresford I\u2019m sure.\u201d\n\u201cOnly she found it very hard to get in touch with her.",
    "She got the\naddress of the hotel where they were supposed to be staying\u2014Mrs.",
    "Lancaster and her relations\u2014but nobody of that name had been staying\nthere or had booked rooms there.\u201d\n\u201cOh That was rather odd.\u201d\n\u201cYes.",
    "Tuppence thought it was rather odd too.",
    "They had left no other\nforwarding address at Sunny Ridge.",
    "In fact we have made several\nattempts to get in touch with Mrs. Lancaster or with this Mrs.\u2014Johnson\nI think the name was\u2014but have been quite unable to get in touch with\nthem.",
    "There was a solicitor who I believe paid all the bills\u2014and made all\nthe arrangements with Miss Packard and we got into communication\nwith him.",
    "But he could only give me the address of a bank.",

    "Still people don\u2019t always answer letters.",
    "They may have gone abroad.\u201d\n\u201cQuite so\u2014it didn\u2019t worry me.",
    "But it has worried my wife.",
    "She\nseems convinced that something has happened to Mrs. Lancaster.",
    "In fact\nduring the time I was away from home she said she was going to\ninvestigate further\u2014I don\u2019t know what exactly she meant to do perhaps\nsee the hotel personally or the bank or try the solicitor.",
    "Anyway she\nwas going to try and get a little more information.\u201d\nDr. Murray looked at him politely but with a trace of patient\nboredom in his manner.",
    "\u201cWhat did she think exactly\u2014\u201d\n\u201cShe thinks that Mrs. Lancaster is in danger of some kind\u2014even that\nsomething may have happened to her.\u201d\nThe doctor raised his eyebrows.",
    "\u201cOh really I should hardly think\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThis may seem quite idiotic to you\u201d said Tommy \u201cbut you see my\nwife rang up saying she would be back yesterday evening\u2014and\u2014she\ndidn\u2019t arrive.\u201d\n\u201cShe said definitely that she was coming back\u201d\n\u201cYes.",
    "She knew I was coming home you see from this conference\nbusiness.",
    "So she rang up to let our man Albert know that she\u2019d be back\nto dinner.\u201d\n\u201cAnd that seems to you an unlikely thing for her to do\u201d said Murray.",
    "He was now looking at Tommy with some interest.",
    "\u201cYes\u201d said Tommy.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s very unlike Tuppence.",
    "If she\u2019d been\ndelayed or changed her plans she would have rung up again or sent a\ntelegram.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re worried about her\u201d\n\u201cYes I am\u201d said Tommy.",
    "\u201cH\u2019m Have you consulted the police\u201d\n\u201cNo\u201d said Tommy.",
    "\u201cWhat\u2019d the police think It\u2019s not as though I had\nany reason to believe that she is in trouble or danger or anything of that\nkind.",
    "I mean if she\u2019d had an accident or was in a hospital anything like\n\n\fthat somebody would communicate with me soon enough wouldn\u2019t\nthey\u201d\n\u201cI should say so\u2014yes\u2014if she had some means of identification on\nher.\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019d have her driving licence on her.",
    "Probably letters and various\nother things.\u201d\nDr. Murray frowned.",
    "Tommy went on in a rush\n\u201cAnd now you come along\u2014And bring up all this business of Sunny\nRidge\u2014People who\u2019ve died when they oughtn\u2019t to have died.",
    "Supposing\nthis old bean got on to something\u2014saw something or suspected\nsomething\u2014and began chattering about it\u2014She\u2019d have to be silenced in\nsome way so she was whisked out of it quickly and taken off to some\nplace or other where she wouldn\u2019t be traced.",
    "I can\u2019t help feeling that the\nwhole thing ties up somehow\u2014\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s odd\u2014it\u2019s certainly odd\u2014What do you propose to do next\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m going to do a bit of searching myself\u2014Try these solicitors first\n\u2014They may be quite all right but I\u2019d like to have a look at them and\ndraw my own conclusions.\u201d\n\n\fTwelve\nTOMMY MEETS AN OLD FRIEND\n\nFrom the opposite side of the road Tommy surveyed the premises of\nMessrs. Partingdale Harris Lockeridge and Partingdale.",
    "They looked eminently respectable and oldfashioned.",
    "The brass\nplate was well worn but nicely polished.",
    "He crossed the street and passed\nthrough swing doors to be greeted by the muted note of typewriters at\nfull speed.",
    "He addressed himself to an open mahogany window on his right\nwhich bore the legend INQUIRIES\u2014\nInside was a small room where three women were typing and two\nmale clerks were bending over desks copying documents.",
    "There was a faint musty atmosphere with a decidedly legal flavour.",
    "A woman of thirtyfive odd with a severe air faded blonde hair and\npincenez rose from her typewriter and came to the window.",
    "\u201cCan I help you\u201d\n\u201cI would like to see Mr. Eccles.\u201d\nThe woman\u2019s air of severity redoubled.",
    "\u201cHave you an appointment\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid not.",
    "I\u2019m just passing through London today.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid Mr. Eccles is rather busy this morning.",
    "Perhaps another\nmember of the firm\u2014\u201d\n\u201cIt was Mr. Eccles I particularly wanted to see.",
    "I have already had\nsome correspondence with him.\u201d\n\u201cOh I see.",
    "Perhaps you\u2019ll give me your name.\u201d\nTommy gave his name and address and the blonde woman retired to\nconfer with the telephone on her desk.",
    "After a murmured conversation\n\n\fshe returned.",
    "\u201cThe clerk will show you into the waiting room.",
    "Mr. Eccles will be\nable to see you in about ten minutes\u2019 time.\u201d\nTommy was ushered into a waiting room which had a bookcase of\nrather ancient and ponderouslooking law tomes and a round table\ncovered with various financial papers.",
    "Tommy sat there and went over in\nhis own mind his planned methods of approach.",
    "He wondered what Mr.\nEccles would be like.",
    "When he was shown in at last and Mr. Eccles rose\nfrom a desk to receive him he decided for no particular reason that he\ncould name to himself that he did not like Mr. Eccles.",
    "He also wondered\nwhy he did not like Mr. Eccles.",
    "There seemed no valid reason for dislike.",
    "Mr. Eccles was a man of between forty and fifty with greyish hair\nthinning a little at the temples.",
    "He had a long rather sadlooking face\nwith a particularly wooden expression shrewd eyes and quite a pleasant\nsmile which from time to time rather unexpectedly broke up the natural\nmelancholy of his countenance.",
    "\u201cMr.",
    "Beresford\u201d\n\u201cYes.",
    "It is really rather a trifling matter but my wife has been\nworried about it.",
    "She wrote to you I believe or possibly she may have\nrung you up to know if you could give her the address of a Mrs.\nLancaster.\u201d\n\u201cMrs.",
    "Lancaster\u201d said Mr. Eccles retaining a perfect poker face.",
    "It\nwas not even a question.",
    "He just left the name hanging in the air.",
    "\u201cA cautious man\u201d thought Tommy \u201cbut then it\u2019s second nature for\nlawyers to be cautious.",
    "In fact if they were one\u2019s own lawyers one\nwould prefer them to be cautious.\u201d\nHe went on\n\u201cUntil lately living at a place called Sunny Ridge an establishment\u2014\nand a very good one\u2014for elderly ladies.",
    "In fact an aunt of my own was\nthere and was extremely happy and comfortable.\u201d\n\u201cOh yes of course of course.",
    "I remember now.",
    "Mrs. Lancaster.",
    "She\nis I think no longer living there That is right is it not\u201d\n\u201cYes\u201d said Tommy.",
    "\u201cAt the moment I do not exactly recall\u2014\u201d he stretched out a hand\ntowards the telephone\u2014\u201cI will just refresh my memory\u2014\u201d\n\n\f\u201cI can tell you quite simply\u201d said Tommy.",
    "\u201cMy wife wanted Mrs.\nLancaster\u2019s address because she happens to be in possession of a piece of\nproperty which originally belonged to Mrs. Lancaster.",
    "A picture in fact.",
    "It was given by Mrs. Lancaster as a present to my aunt Miss Fanshawe.",
    "My aunt died recently and her few possessions have come into our\nkeeping.",
    "This included the picture which was given her by Mrs.\nLancaster.",
    "My wife likes it very much but she feels rather guilty about it.",
    "She thinks that it may be a picture Mrs. Lancaster values and in that case\nshe feels she ought to offer to return it to Mrs. Lancaster.\u201d\n\u201cAh I see\u201d said Mr. Eccles.",
    "\u201cIt is very conscientious of your wife I\nam sure.\u201d\n\u201cOne never knows\u201d said Tommy smiling pleasantly \u201cwhat elderly\npeople may feel about their possessions.",
    "She may have been glad for my\naunt to have it since my aunt admired it but as my aunt died very soon\nafter having received this gift it seems perhaps a little unfair that it\nshould pass into the possession of strangers.",
    "There is no particular title\non the picture.",
    "It represents a house somewhere in the country.",
    "For all I\nknow it may be some family house associated with Mrs. Lancaster.\u201d\n\u201cQuite quite\u201d said Mr. Eccles \u201cbut I don\u2019t think\u2014\u201d\nThere was a knock and the door opened and a clerk entered and\nproduced a sheet of paper which he placed before Mr. Eccles.",
    "Mr. Eccles\nlooked down.",
    "\u201cAh yes ah yes I remember now.",
    "Yes I believe Mrs.\u2014\u201d he glanced\ndown at Tommy\u2019s card lying on his desk\u2014\u201cBeresford rang up and had a\nfew words with me.",
    "I advised her to get into touch with the Southern\nCounties Bank Hammersmith branch.",
    "This is the only address I myself\nknow.",
    "Letters addressed to the bank\u2019s address care of Mrs. Richard\nJohnson would be forwarded.",
    "Mrs. Johnson is I believe a niece or\ndistant cousin of Mrs. Lancaster\u2019s and it was Mrs. Johnson who made all\nthe arrangements with me for Mrs. Lancaster\u2019s reception at Sunny Ridge.",
    "She asked me to make full inquiries about the establishment since she\nhad only heard about it casually from a friend.",
    "We did so I can assure\nyou most carefully.",
    "It was said to be an excellent establishment and I\nbelieve Mrs. Johnson\u2019s relative Mrs. Lancaster spent several years there\nquite happily.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cShe left there though rather suddenly\u201d Tommy suggested.",
    "\u201cYes.",
    "Yes I believe she did.",
    "Mrs. Johnson it seems returned rather\nunexpectedly recently from East Africa\u2014so many people have done so\nShe and her husband had I believe resided in Kenya for many years.",
    "They were making various new arrangements and felt able to assume\npersonal care of their elderly relative.",
    "I am afraid I have no knowledge of\nMrs. Johnson\u2019s present whereabouts.",
    "I had a letter from her thanking me\nand settling accounts she owed and directing that if there was any\nnecessity for communicating with her I should address my letters care of\nthe bank as she was undecided as yet where she and her husband would\nactually be residing.",
    "I am afraid Mr. Beresford that that is all I know.\u201d\nHis manner was gentle but firm.",
    "It displayed no embarrassment of\nany kind nor disturbance.",
    "But the finality of his voice was very definite.",
    "Then he unbent and his manner softened a little.",
    "\u201cI shouldn\u2019t really worry you know Mr. Beresford\u201d he said\nreassuringly.",
    "\u201cOr rather I shouldn\u2019t let your wife worry.",
    "Mrs. Lancaster\nI believe is quite an old lady and inclined to be forgetful.",
    "She\u2019s probably\nforgotten all about this picture that she gave away.",
    "She is I believe\nseventyfive or seventysix years of age.",
    "One forgets very easily at that\nage you know.\u201d\n\u201cDid you know her personally\u201d\n\u201cNo I never actually met her.\u201d\n\u201cBut you knew Mrs. Johnson\u201d\n\u201cI met her when she came here occasionally to consult me as to\narrangements.",
    "She seemed a pleasant businesslike woman.",
    "Quite\ncompetent in the arrangements she was making.\u201d He rose and said \u201cI am\nso sorry I can\u2019t help you Mr. Beresford.\u201d\nIt was a gentle but firm dismissal.",
    "Tommy came out on to the Bloomsbury street and looked about him\nfor a taxi.",
    "The parcel he was carrying though not heavy was of a fairly\nawkward size.",
    "He looked up for a moment at the building he had just\nleft.",
    "Eminently respectable long established.",
    "Nothing you could fault\nthere nothing apparently wrong with Messrs. Partingdale Harris\nLockeridge and Partingdale nothing wrong with Mr. Eccles no signs of\nalarm or despondency no shiftiness or uneasiness.",
    "In books Tommy\n\n\fthought gloomily a mention of Mrs. Lancaster or Mrs. Johnson should\nhave brought a guilty start or a shifty glance.",
    "Something to show that the\nnames registered that all was not well.",
    "Things didn\u2019t seem to happen\nlike that in real life.",
    "All Mr. Eccles had looked like was a man who was\ntoo polite to resent having his time wasted by such an inquiry as Tommy\nhad just made.",
    "But all the same thought Tommy to himself I don\u2019t like Mr. Eccles.",
    "He recalled to himself vague memories of the past of other people that\nhe had for some reason not liked.",
    "Very often those hunches\u2014for hunches\nis all they were\u2014had been right.",
    "But perhaps it was simpler than that.",
    "If\nyou had had a good many dealings in your time with personalities you\nhad a sort of feeling about them just as an expert antique dealer knows\ninstinctively the taste and look and feel of a forgery before getting down\nto expert tests and examinations.",
    "The thing just is wrong.",
    "The same with\npictures.",
    "The same presumably with a cashier in a bank who is offered a\nfirstclass spurious banknote.",
    "\u201cHe sounds all right\u201d thought Tommy.",
    "\u201cHe looks all right he speaks\nall right but all the same\u2014\u201d He waved frantically at a taxi which gave\nhim a direct and cold look increased its speed and drove on.",
    "\u201cSwine\u201d\nthought Tommy.",
    "His eyes roved up and down the street seeking for a more obliging\nvehicle.",
    "A fair amount of people were walking on the pavement.",
    "A few\nhurrying some strolling one man gazing at a brass plate just across the\nroad from him.",
    "After a close scrutiny he turned round and Tommy\u2019s eyes\nopened a little wider.",
    "He knew that face.",
    "He watched the man walk to the\nend of the street pause turn and walk back again.",
    "Somebody came out\nof the building behind Tommy and at that moment the man opposite\nincreased his pace a little still walking on the other side of the road but\nkeeping pace with the man who had come out of the door.",
    "The man who\nhad come out of Messrs. Partingdale Harris Lockeridge and\nPartingdale\u2019s doorway was Tommy thought looking after his retreating\nfigure almost certainly Mr. Eccles.",
    "At the same moment a taxi lingering\nin a pleasant tempting manner came along.",
    "Tommy raised his hand the\ntaxi drew up he opened the door and got in.",
    "\u201cWhere to\u201d\n\n\fTommy hesitated for a moment looking at his parcel.",
    "About to give\nan address he changed his mind and said \u201c14 Lyon Street.\u201d\nA quarter of an hour later he had reached his destination.",
    "He rang the\nbell after paying off the taxi and asked for Mr. Ivor Smith.",
    "When he\nentered a secondfloor room a man sitting at a table facing the window\nswung round and said with faint surprise\n\u201cHullo Tommy fancy seeing you.",
    "It\u2019s a long time.",
    "What are you\ndoing here Just tooling round looking up your old friends\u201d\n\u201cNot quite as good as that Ivor.\u201d\n\u201cI suppose you\u2019re on your way home after the Conference\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cAll a lot of the usual talkytalky I suppose No conclusions drawn\nand nothing helpful said.\u201d\n\u201cQuite right.",
    "All a sheer waste of time.\u201d\n\u201cMostly listening to old Bogie Waddock shooting his mouth off I\nexpect.",
    "Crashing bore.",
    "Gets worse every year.\u201d\n\u201cOh well\u2014\u201d\nTommy sat down in the chair that was pushed towards him accepted\na cigarette and said\n\u201cI just wondered\u2014it\u2019s a very long shot\u2014whether you know anything\nof a derogatory nature about one Eccles solicitor of the firm of Messrs.\nPartingdale Harris Lockeridge and Partingdale.\u201d\n\u201cWell well well\u201d said the man called Ivor Smith.",
    "He raised his\neyebrows.",
    "They were very convenient eyebrows for raising.",
    "The end of\nthem near the nose went up and the opposite end of the cheek went down\nfor an almost astonishing extent.",
    "They made him on very little\nprovocation look like a man who had had a severe shock but actually it\nwas quite a common gesture with him.",
    "\u201cRun up against Eccles\nsomewhere have you\u201d\n\u201cThe trouble is\u201d said Tommy \u201cthat I know nothing about him.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you want to know something about him\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cHm.",
    "What made you come to see me\u201d\n\u201cI saw Anderson outside.",
    "It was a long time since I\u2019d seen him but I\nrecognized him.",
    "He was keeping someone or other under observation.",
    "Whoever it was it was someone in the building from which I had just\nemerged.",
    "Two firms of lawyers practise there and one firm of chartered\naccountants.",
    "Of course it may be any one of them or any member of any\none of them.",
    "But a man walking away down the street looked to me like\nEccles.",
    "And I just wondered if by a lucky chance it could have been my\nMr. Eccles that Anderson was giving his attention to\u201d\n\u201cHm\u201d said Ivor Smith.",
    "\u201cWell Tommy you always were a pretty\ngood guesser.\u201d\n\u201cWho is Eccles\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t you know Haven\u2019t you any idea\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve no idea whatever\u201d said Tommy.",
    "\u201cWithout going into a long\nhistory I went to him for some information about an old lady who has\nrecently left an old ladies\u2019 home.",
    "The solicitor employed to make\narrangements for her was Mr. Eccles.",
    "He appears to have done it with\nperfect decorum and efficiency.",
    "I wanted her present address.",
    "He says he\nhasn\u2019t got it.",
    "Quite possibly he hasn\u2019t .",
    ". . but I wondered.",
    "He\u2019s the only\nclue to her whereabouts I\u2019ve got.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you want to find her\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it sounds as though I\u2019m going to be much good to you.",
    "Eccles is a very respectable sound solicitor who makes a large income\nhas a good many highly respectable clients works for the landed gentry\nprofessional classes and retired soldiers and sailors generals and\nadmirals and all that sort of thing.",
    "He\u2019s the acme of respectability.",
    "I\nshould imagine from what you\u2019re talking about that he was strictly\nwithin his lawful activities.\u201d\n\u201cBut you\u2019re\u2014interested in him\u201d suggested Tommy.",
    "\u201cYes we\u2019re very interested in Mr. James Eccles.\u201d He sighed.",
    "\u201cWe\u2019ve\nbeen interested in him for at least six years.",
    "We haven\u2019t progressed very\nfar.\u201d\n\u201cVery interesting\u201d said Tommy.",
    "\u201cI\u2019ll ask you again.",
    "Who exactly is\nMr. Eccles\u201d\n\u201cYou mean what do we suspect Eccles of Well to put it in a\nsentence we suspect him of being one of the best organizing brains in\ncriminal activity in this country.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cCriminal activity\u201d Tommy looked surprised.",
    "\u201cOh yes yes.",
    "No cloak and dagger.",
    "No espionage no\ncounterespionage.",
    "No plain criminal activity.",
    "He is a man who has so far\nas we can discover never performed a criminal act in his life.",
    "He has\nnever stolen anything he\u2019s never forged anything he\u2019s never converted\nfunds we can\u2019t get any kind of evidence against him.",
    "But all the same\nwhenever there\u2019s a big planned organized robbery there we find\nsomewhere in the background Mr. Eccles leading a blameless life.\u201d\n\u201cSix years\u201d said Tommy thoughtfully.",
    "\u201cPossibly even longer than that.",
    "It took a little time to get on to the\npattern of things.",
    "Bank holdups robberies of private jewels all sorts of\nthings where the big money was.",
    "They\u2019re all jobs that followed a certain\npattern.",
    "You couldn\u2019t help feeling that the same mind had planned them.",
    "The people who directed them and who carried them out never had to do\nany planning at all.",
    "They went where they were told they did what they\nwere ordered they never had to think.",
    "Somebody else was doing the\nthinking.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what made you hit on Eccles\u201d\nIvor Smith shook his head thoughtfully.",
    "\u201cIt would take too long to\ntell you.",
    "He\u2019s a man who has a lot of acquaintances a lot of friends.",
    "There are people he plays golf with there are people who service his car\nthere are firms of stockbrokers who act for him.",
    "There are companies\ndoing a blameless business in which he is interested.",
    "The plan is getting\nclearer but his part in it hasn\u2019t got much clearer except that he is very\nconspicuously absent on certain occasions.",
    "A big bank robbery cleverly\nplanned and no expense spared mind you consolidating the getaway\nand all the rest of it and where\u2019s Mr. Eccles when it happens Monte\nCarlo or Zurich or possibly even fishing for salmon in Norway.",
    "You can\nbe quite sure Mr. Eccles is never within a hundred miles of where\ncriminal activities are happening.\u201d\n\u201cYet you suspect him\u201d\n\u201cOh yes.",
    "I\u2019m quite sure in my own mind.",
    "But whether we\u2019ll ever\ncatch him I don\u2019t know.",
    "The man who tunnelled through the floor of a\nbank the man who knocked out the night watchman the cashier who\nwas in it from the beginning the bank manager who supplied the\n\n\finformation none of them know Eccles probably they\u2019ve never even\nseen him.",

    "Some day\nwe\u2019ll get a chance.",
    "Somebody who oughtn\u2019t to know anything will\nknow something.",
    "Something silly and trivial perhaps but something that\nstrangely enough may be evidence at last.\u201d\n\u201cIs he married\u2014got a family\u201d\n\u201cNo he has never taken risks like that.",
    "He lives alone with a\nhousekeeper and a gardener and a butlervalet.",
    "He entertains in a mild\nand pleasant way and I dare swear that every single person who\u2019s\nentered his house as his guest is beyond suspicion.\u201d\n\u201cAnd nobody\u2019s getting rich\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s a good point you\u2019ve put your finger on Thomas.",

    "There\u2019s a lot of money stacked up abroad in different\ncountries and different places.",
    "It\u2019s a great big vast moneymaking\nconcern\u2014and the money\u2019s always on the move\u2014going from place to\nplace.\u201d\n\u201cWell\u201d said Tommy \u201cgood luck to you.",

    "There might be a hope if one\ncould jolt him out of his routine.\u201d\n\u201cJolt him with what\u201d\n\u201cDanger\u201d said Ivor.",
    "\u201cMake him feel he\u2019s in danger.",
    "Make him feel\nsomeone\u2019s on to him.",
    "Get him uneasy.",
    "If you once get a man uneasy he\nmay do something foolish.",
    "He may make a mistake.",
    "That\u2019s the way you\nget chaps you know.",
    "Take the cleverest man there is who can plan\nbrilliantly and never put a foot wrong.",
    "Let some little thing rattle him and\nhe\u2019ll make a mistake.",
    "So I\u2019m hoping.",
    "Now let\u2019s hear your story.",
    "You\nmight know something that would be useful.\u201d\n\u201cNothing to do with crime I\u2019m afraid\u2014very small beer.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cWell let\u2019s hear about it.\u201d\nTommy told his story without undue apologies for the triviality of it.",
    "Ivor he knew was not a man to despise triviality.",
    "Ivor indeed went\nstraight to the point which had brought Tommy on his errand.",
    "\u201cAnd your wife\u2019s disappeared you say\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like her.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s serious.\u201d\n\u201cSerious to me all right.\u201d\n\u201cSo I can imagine.",
    "I only met your missus once.",
    "She\u2019s sharp.\u201d\n\u201cIf she goes after things she\u2019s like a terrier on a trail\u201d said Thomas.",
    "\u201cYou\u2019ve not been to the police\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cWhy not\u201d\n\u201cWell first because I can\u2019t believe that she\u2019s anything but all right.",
    "Tuppence is always all right.",
    "She just goes all out after any hare that\nshows itself.",
    "She mayn\u2019t have had time to communicate.\u201d\n\u201cMmm.",
    "I don\u2019t like it very much.",
    "She\u2019s looking for a house you say\nThat just might be interesting because among various odds and ends that\nwe followed which incidentally have not led to much are a kind of trail\nof house agents.\u201d\n\u201cHouse agents\u201d Tommy looked surprised.",
    "\u201cYes.",
    "Nice ordinary rather mediocre house agents in small\nprovincial towns in different parts of England but none of them so very\nfar from London.",
    "Mr. Eccles\u2019s firm does a lot of business with and for\nhouse agents.",
    "Sometimes he\u2019s the solicitor for the buyers and sometimes\nfor the sellers and he employs various house agencies on behalf of\nclients.",
    "Sometimes we rather wondered why.",
    "None of it seems very\nprofitable you see\u2014\u201d\n\u201cBut you think it might mean something or lead to something\u201d\n\u201cWell if you remember the big London Southern Bank robbery some\nyears ago there was a house in the country\u2014a lonely house.",
    "That was\nthe thieves\u2019 rendezvous.",
    "They weren\u2019t very noticeable there but that\u2019s\nwhere the stuff was brought and cached away.",
    "People in the\nneighbourhood began to have a few stories about them and wonder who\nthese people were who came and went at rather unusual hours.",
    "Different\n\n\fkinds of cars arriving in the middle of the night and going away again.",
    "People are curious about their neighbours in the country.",
    "Sure enough\nthe police raided the place they got some of the loot and they got three\nmen including one who was recognized and identified.\u201d\n\u201cWell didn\u2019t that lead you somewhere\u201d\n\u201cNot really.",
    "The men wouldn\u2019t talk they were well defended and\nrepresented they got long sentences in gaol and within a year and a half\nthey were all out of the jug again.",
    "Very clever rescues.\u201d\n\u201cI seem to remember reading about it.",
    "One man disappeared from a\ncriminal court where he was brought up by two warders.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s right.",
    "All very cleverly arranged and an enormous amount of\nmoney spent on the escape.",
    "\u201cBut we think that whoever was responsible for the staff work\nrealized he made a mistake in having one house for too long a time so\nthat the local people got interested.",
    "Somebody perhaps thought it would\nbe a better idea to get subsidiaries living in say as many as thirty houses\nin different places.",
    "People come and take a house mother and daughter\nsay a widow or a retired army man and his wife.",
    "Nice quiet people.",
    "They have a few repairs done to the house get a local builder in and\nimprove the plumbing and perhaps some other firm down from London\nto decorate and then after a year or a year and a half circumstances arise\nand the occupiers sell the house and go off abroad to live.",
    "Something like\nthat.",
    "All very natural and pleasant.",
    "During their tenancy that house has\nbeen used perhaps for rather unusual purposes But no one suspects such\na thing.",
    "Friends come to see them not very often.",
    "Just occasionally.",
    "One\nnight perhaps a kind of anniversary party for a middleaged or elderly\ncouple or a coming of age party.",
    "A lot of cars coming and going.",
    "Say\nthere are five major robberies done within six months but each time the\nloot passes through or is cached in not just one of these houses but five\ndifferent houses in five different parts of the countryside.",
    "It\u2019s only a\nsupposition as yet my dear Tommy but we\u2019re working on it.",
    "Let\u2019s say\nyour old lady lets a picture of a certain house go out of her possession\nand supposing that\u2019s a significant house.",
    "And supposing that that\u2019s the\nhouse that your missus has recognized somewhere and has gone dashing\n\n\foff to investigate.",
    "And supposing someone doesn\u2019t want that particular\nhouse investigated\u2014It might tie up you know.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s very farfetched.\u201d\n\u201cOh yes\u2014I agree.",
    "But these times we live in are farfetched times\u2014\nIn our particular world incredible things happen.\u201d\n\nII\nSomewhat wearily Tommy alighted from his fourth taxi of the day and\nlooked appraisingly at his surroundings.",
    "The taxi had deposited him in a\nsmall culdesac which tucked itself coyly under one of the\nprotuberances of Hampstead Heath.",
    "The culdesac seemed to have been\nsome artistic \u201cdevelopment.\u201d Each house was wildly different from the\nhouse next to it.",
    "This particular one seemed to consist of a large studio\nwith skylights in it and attached to it rather like a gumboil on one side\nwas what seemed to be a little cluster of three rooms.",
    "A ladder staircase\npainted bright green ran up the outside of the house.",
    "Tommy opened the\nsmall gate went up a path and not seeing a bell applied himself to the\nknocker.",
    "Getting no response he paused for a few moments and then\nstarted again with the knocker a little louder this time.",
    "The door opened so suddenly that he nearly fell backwards.",
    "A\nwoman stood on the doorstep.",
    "At first sight Tommy\u2019s first impression\nwas that this was one of the plainest women he had ever seen.",
    "She had a\nlarge expanse of flat pancakelike face two enormous eyes which\nseemed of impossibly different colours one green and one brown a\nnoble forehead with a quantity of wild hair rising up from it in a kind of\nthicket.",
    "She wore a purple overall with blotches of clay on it and\nTommy noticed that the hand that held the door open was one of\nexceeding beauty of structure.",
    "\u201cOh\u201d she said.",
    "Her voice was deep and rather attractive.",
    "\u201cWhat is it\nI\u2019m busy.\u201d\n\u201cMrs.",
    "Boscowan\u201d\n\u201cYes.",
    "What do you want\u201d\n\u201cMy name\u2019s Beresford.",
    "I wondered if I might speak to you for a few\nmoments.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cI don\u2019t know.",
    "Really must you What is it\u2014something about a\npicture\u201d Her eye had gone to what he held under his arm.",
    "\u201cYes.",
    "It\u2019s something to do with one of your husband\u2019s pictures.\u201d\n\u201cDo you want to sell it I\u2019ve got plenty of his pictures.",
    "I don\u2019t want\nto buy any more of them.",
    "Take it to one of these galleries or something.",
    "They\u2019re beginning to buy him now.",
    "You don\u2019t look as though you needed\nto sell pictures.\u201d\n\u201cOh no I don\u2019t want to sell anything.\u201d\nTommy felt extraordinary difficulty in talking to this particular\nwoman.",
    "Her eyes unmatching though they were were very fine eyes and\nthey were looking now over his shoulder down the street with an air of\nsome peculiar interest at something in the far distance.",
    "\u201cPlease\u201d said Tommy.",
    "\u201cI wish you would let me come in.",
    "It\u2019s so\ndifficult to explain.\u201d\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a painter I don\u2019t want to talk to you\u201d said Mrs. Boscowan.",
    "\u201cI find painters very boring always.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not a painter.\u201d\n\u201cWell you don\u2019t look like one certainly.\u201d Her eyes raked him up and\ndown.",
    "\u201cYou look more like a civil servant\u201d she said disapprovingly.",
    "\u201cCan I come in Mrs. Boscowan\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure.",
    "Wait.\u201d\nShe shut the door rather abruptly.",
    "Tommy waited.",
    "After about four\nminutes had passed the door opened again.",
    "\u201cAll right\u201d she said.",
    "\u201cYou can come in.\u201d\nShe led him through the doorway up a narrow staircase and into the\nlarge studio.",
    "In a corner of it there was a figure and various implements\nstanding by it.",
    "Hammers and chisels.",
    "There was also a clay head.",
    "The\nwhole place looked as though it had recently been savaged by a gang of\nhooligans.",
    "\u201cThere\u2019s never any room to sit up here\u201d said Mrs. Boscowan.",
    "She threw various things off a wooden stool and pushed it towards\nhim.",
    "\u201cThere.",
    "Sit down here and speak to me.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s very kind of you to let me come in.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cIt is rather but you looked so worried.",
    "You are worried aren\u2019t you\nabout something\u201d\n\u201cYes I am.\u201d\n\u201cI thought so.",
    "What are you worried about\u201d\n\u201cMy wife\u201d said Tommy surprising himself by his answer.",
    "\u201cOh worried about your wife Well there\u2019s nothing unusual in that.",
    "Men are always worrying about their wives.",
    "What\u2019s the matter\u2014has she\ngone off with someone or playing up\u201d\n\u201cNo.",
    "Nothing like that.\u201d\n\u201cDying Cancer\u201d\n\u201cNo\u201d said Tommy.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s just that I don\u2019t know where she is.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you think I might Well you\u2019d better tell me her name and\nsomething about her if you think I can find her for you.",
    "I\u2019m not sure\nmind you\u201d said Mrs. Boscowan \u201cthat I shall want to.",
    "I\u2019m warning you.\u201d\n\u201cThank God\u201d said Tommy \u201cyou\u2019re more easy to talk to than I\nthought you were going to be.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the picture got to do with it It is a picture isn\u2019t it\u2014must be\nthat shape.\u201d\nTommy undid the wrappings.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s a picture signed by your husband\u201d said Tommy.",
    "\u201cI want you to\ntell me what you can about it.\u201d\n\u201cI see.",
    "What exactly do you want to know\u201d\n\u201cWhen it was painted and where it is.\u201d\nMrs. Boscowan looked at him and for the first time there was a slight\nlook of interest in her eyes.",
    "\u201cWell that\u2019s not difficult\u201d she said.",
    "\u201cYes I can tell you all about it.",
    "It\nwas painted about fifteen years ago\u2014no a good deal longer than that I\nshould think.",
    "It\u2019s one of his fairly early ones.",
    "Twenty years ago I should\nsay.\u201d\n\u201cYou know where it is\u2014the place I mean\u201d\n\u201cOh yes I can remember quite well.",
    "Nice picture.",
    "I always liked it.",
    "That\u2019s the little humpbacked bridge and the house and the name of the\nplace is Sutton Chancellor.",
    "About seven or eight miles from Market\nBasing.",
    "The house itself is about a couple of miles from Sutton\nChancellor.",
    "Pretty place.",
    "Secluded.\u201d\n\n\fShe came up to the picture bent down and peered at it closely.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s funny\u201d she said.",
    "\u201cYes that\u2019s very odd.",
    "I wonder now.\u201d\nTommy did not pay much attention.",
    "\u201cWhat\u2019s the name of the house\u201d he asked.",
    "\u201cI can\u2019t really remember.",
    "It got renamed you know.",
    "Several times.",
    "I\ndon\u2019t know what there was about it.",
    "A couple of rather tragic things\nhappened there I think then the next people who came along renamed it.",
    "Called the Canal House once or Canal Side.",
    "Once it was called Bridge\nHouse then Meadowside\u2014or Riverside was another name.\u201d\n\u201cWho lived there\u2014or who lives there now Do you know\u201d\n\u201cNobody I know.",
    "Man and a girl lived there when first I saw it.",
    "Used\nto come down for weekends.",
    "Not married I think.",
    "The girl was a dancer.",
    "May have been an actress\u2014no I think she was a dancer.",
    "Ballet dancer.",
    "Rather beautiful but dumb.",
    "Simple almost wanting.",
    "William was quite\nsoft about her I remember.\u201d\n\u201cDid he paint her\u201d\n\u201cNo.",
    "He didn\u2019t often paint people.",
    "He used to say sometimes he\nwanted to do a sketch of them but he never did much about it.",
    "He was\nalways silly over girls.\u201d\n\u201cThey were the people who were there when your husband was\npainting the house\u201d\n\u201cYes I think so.",
    "Part of the time anyway.",
    "They only came down\nweekends.",
    "Then there was some kind of a bustup.",
    "They had a row I\nthink or he went away and left her or she went away and left him.",
    "I\nwasn\u2019t down there myself.",
    "I was working in Coventry then doing a\ngroup.",
    "After that I think there was just a governess in the house and the\nchild.",
    "I don\u2019t know who the child was or where she came from but I\nsuppose the governess was looking after her.",
    "Then I think something\nhappened to the child.",
    "Either the governess took her away somewhere or\nperhaps she died.",
    "What do you want to know about the people who lived\nin the house twenty years ago Seems to me idiotic.\u201d\n\u201cI want to hear anything I can about that house\u201d said Tommy.",
    "\u201cYou\nsee my wife went away to look for that house.",
    "She said she\u2019d seen it out\nof a train somewhere.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cQuite right\u201d said Mrs. Boscowan \u201cthe railway line runs just the\nother side of the bridge.",
    "You can see the house very well from it I\nexpect.\u201d Then she said \u201cWhy did she want to find that house\u201d\nTommy gave a much abridged explanation\u2014she looked at him\ndoubtfully.",
    "\u201cYou haven\u2019t come out of a mental home or anything have you\u201d\nsaid Mrs. Boscowan.",
    "\u201cOn parole or something whatever they call it.\u201d\n\u201cI suppose I must sound a little like that\u201d said Tommy \u201cbut it\u2019s quite\nsimple really.",
    "My wife wanted to find out about this house and so she\ntried to take various train journeys to find out where it was she\u2019d seen it.",
    "Well I think she did find out.",
    "I think she went there to this place\u2014\nsomething Chancellor\u201d\n\u201cSutton Chancellor yes.",
    "Very onehorse place it used to be.",
    "Of\ncourse it may be a big development or even one of these new dormitory\ntowns by now.\u201d\n\u201cIt might be anything I expect\u201d said Tommy.",
    "\u201cShe telephoned she\nwas coming back but she didn\u2019t come back.",
    "And I want to know what\u2019s\nhappened to her.",
    "I think she went and started investigating that house and\nperhaps\u2014perhaps she ran into danger.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s dangerous about it\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d said Tommy.",
    "\u201cNeither of us knew.",
    "I didn\u2019t even think\nthere could be any danger about it but my wife did.\u201d\n\u201cE.S.P.\u201d\n\u201cPossibly.",
    "She\u2019s a little like that.",
    "She has hunches.",
    "You never heard\nof or knew a Mrs. Lancaster twenty years ago or any time up to a month\nago\u201d\n\u201cMrs.",
    "Lancaster No I don\u2019t think so.",
    "Sort of name one might\nremember mightn\u2019t it be.",
    "No.",
    "What about Mrs. Lancaster\u201d\n\u201cShe was the woman who owned this picture.",
    "She gave it as a\nfriendly gesture to an aunt of mine.",
    "Then she left an old people\u2019s home\nrather suddenly.",
    "Her relatives took her away.",
    "I\u2019ve tried to trace her but it\nisn\u2019t easy.\u201d\n\u201cWho\u2019s the one who\u2019s got the imagination you or your wife You\nseem to have thought up a lot of things and to be rather in a state if I\nmay say so.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cOh yes you can say so\u201d said Tommy.",
    "\u201cRather in a state and all\nabout nothing at all.",
    "That\u2019s what you mean isn\u2019t it I suppose you\u2019re\nright too.\u201d\n\u201cNo\u201d said Mrs. Boscowan.",
    "Her voice had altered slightly.",
    "\u201cI\nwouldn\u2019t say about nothing at all.\u201d\nTommy looked at her inquiringly.",
    "\u201cThere\u2019s one thing that\u2019s odd about that picture\u201d said Mrs.\nBoscowan.",
    "\u201cVery odd.",
    "I remember it quite well you know.",
    "I remember\nmost of William\u2019s pictures although he painted such a lot of them.\u201d\n\u201cDo you remember who it was sold to if it was sold\u201d\n\u201cNo I don\u2019t remember that.",
    "Yes I think it was sold.",
    "There was a\nwhole batch of his paintings sold from one of his exhibitions.",
    "They ran\nback for about three or four years before this and a couple of years later\nthan this.",
    "Quite a lot of them were sold.",
    "Nearly all of them.",
    "But I can\u2019t\nremember by now who it was sold to.",
    "That\u2019s asking too much.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m very grateful to you for all you have remembered.\u201d\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t asked me yet why I said there was something odd about\nthe picture.",
    "This picture that you brought here.\u201d\n\u201cYou mean it isn\u2019t your husband\u2019s\u2014somebody else painted it\u201d\n\u201cOh no.",
    "That\u2019s the picture that William painted.",
    "\u2018House by a Canal\u2019\nI think he called it in the catalogue.",
    "But it isn\u2019t as it was.",
    "You see there\u2019s\nsomething wrong with it.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with it\u201d\nMrs. Boscowan stretched out a claysmeared finger and jabbed at a\nspot just below the bridge spanning the canal.",
    "\u201cThere\u201d she said.",
    "\u201cYou see There\u2019s a boat tied up under the bridge\nisn\u2019t there\u201d\n\u201cYes\u201d said Tommy puzzled.",
    "\u201cWell that boat wasn\u2019t there not when I saw it last.",
    "William never\npainted that boat.",
    "When it was exhibited there was no boat of any kind.\u201d\n\u201cYou mean that somebody not your husband painted the boat in here\nafterwards\u201d\n\u201cYes.",
    "Odd isn\u2019t it I wonder why.",
    "First of all I was surprised to see\nthe boat there a place where there wasn\u2019t any boat then I can see quite\n\n\fwell that it wasn\u2019t painted by William.",
    "He didn\u2019t put it in at any time.",
    "Somebody else did.",
    "I wonder who\u201d\nShe looked at Tommy.",
    "\u201cAnd I wonder why\u201d\nTommy had no solution to offer.",
    "He looked at Mrs. Boscowan.",
    "His\nAunt Ada would have called her a scatty woman but Tommy did not\nthink of her in that light.",
    "She was vague with an abrupt way of jumping\nfrom one subject to another.",
    "The things she said seemed to have very\nlittle relation to the last thing she had said a minute before.",
    "She was the\nsort of person Tommy thought who might know a great deal more than\nshe chose to reveal.",
    "Had she loved her husband or been jealous of her\nhusband or despised her husband There was really no clue whatever in\nher manner or indeed her words.",
    "But he had the feeling that that small\npainted boat tied up under the bridge had caused her uneasiness.",
    "She\nhadn\u2019t liked the boat being there.",
    "Suddenly he wondered if the statement\nshe had made was true.",
    "Could she really remember from long years back\nwhether Boscowan had painted a boat at the bridge or had not It seemed\nreally a very small and insignificant item.",
    "If it had been only a year ago\nwhen she had seen the picture last\u2014but apparently it was a much longer\ntime than that.",
    "And it had made Mrs. Boscowan uneasy.",
    "He looked at her\nagain and saw that she was looking at him.",
    "Her curious eyes resting on\nhim not defiantly but only thoughtfully.",
    "Very very thoughtfully.",
    "\u201cWhat are you going to do now\u201d she said.",
    "That at least was easy.",
    "Tommy had no difficulty in knowing what he\nwas going to do now.",
    "\u201cI shall go home tonight\u2014see if there is any news of my wife\u2014any\nword from her.",

    "\u201cOh them sir.",
    "You can push papers in them but there\u2019s nothing\nreally secret about them.",
    "The most usual place is to open the little middle\ncupboard\u2014and then at the bottom of it usually there\u2019s a little depression\nand you slide the bottom out and there\u2019s a space.",

    "You push back the panel there\u2019s the cavity and you can put a good many\nthings in there that you want to keep a bit from being pawed over and all\nthat.",
    "But that\u2019s not all as you might say.",
    "Because you see here there\u2019s a\nlittle piece of wood in front like a little ledge.",

    "Tuppence stooped and picked it up.",

    "At the second mention of Mrs. Johnson Miss Bligh had given\nherself away in an unmistakable fashion.",
    "She was shaking and panic\nstricken.",

    "The difficulty of Canal House was that there never seemed to be\nanyone in sight and hardly any traffic came over the bridge.",
    "There was\nno one to ask where the Perrys might be this morning.",

    "Were you wanting Mrs. Perry\u201d said Mrs. Lancaster.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s market day you know.",
    "So lucky I was able to let you in.",
    "I couldn\u2019t\nfind the key for some time.",
    "I think it must be a duplicate anyway don\u2019t\nyou But do come in.",
    "Perhaps you\u2019d like a cup of tea or something.\u201d\nLike one in a dream Tuppence crossed the threshold.",
    "Mrs. Lancaster\nstill retaining the gracious air of a hostess led Tuppence along into the\nsitting room.",

    "That seems to remind me of\nsomething.",
    "Oh of course dear Miss Packard.",
    "Yes a very nice place.\u201d\n\u201cYou left it in rather a hurry didn\u2019t you\u201d said Tuppence.",
    "\u201cPeople are so very bossy\u201d said Mrs. Lancaster.",
    "\u201cThey hurry you so.",
    "They don\u2019t give you time to arrange things or pack properly or anything.",
    "Kindly meant I\u2019m sure.",
    "Of course I\u2019m very fond of dear Nellie Bligh\nbut she\u2019s a very masterful kind of woman.",
    "I sometimes think\u201d Mrs.\n\n\fLancaster added bending forward to Tuppence \u201cI sometimes think you\nknow that she is not quite\u2014\u201d she tapped her forehead significantly.",
    "\u201cOf\ncourse it does happen.",
    "Especially to spinsters.",
    "Unmarried women you\nknow.",
    "Very given to good works and all that but they take very odd\nfancies sometimes.",
    "Curates suffer a great deal.",
    "They seem to think\nsometimes these women that the curate has made them an offer of\nmarriage but really he never thought of doing anything of the kind.",
    "Oh\nyes poor Nellie.",
    "So sensible in some ways.",
    "She\u2019s been wonderful in the\nparish here.",
    "And she was always a firstclass secretary I believe.",
    "But all\nthe same she has some very curious ideas at times.",
    "Like taking me away\nat a moment\u2019s notice from dear Sunny Ridge and then up to Cumberland\n\u2014a very bleak house and again quite suddenly bringing me here\u2014\u201d\n\u201cAre you living here\u201d said Tuppence.",
    "\u201cWell if you can call it that.",
    "It\u2019s a very peculiar arrangement\naltogether.",
    "I\u2019ve only been here two days.\u201d\n\u201cBefore that you were at Rosetrellis Court in Cumberland\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYes I believe that was the name of it.",
    "Not such a pretty name as\nSunny Ridge do you think In fact I never really settled down if you\nknow what I mean.",
    "And it wasn\u2019t nearly as well run.",
    "The service wasn\u2019t\nas good and they had a very inferior brand of coffee.",
    "Still I was getting\nused to things and I had found one or two interesting acquaintances\nthere.",
    "One of them who knew an aunt of mine quite well years ago in\nIndia.",
    "It\u2019s so nice you know when you find connections.\u201d\n\u201cIt must be\u201d said Tuppence.",
    "Mrs. Lancaster continued cheerfully.",
    "\u201cNow let me see you came to Sunny Ridge but not to stay I think.",
    "I\nthink you came to see one of the guests there.\u201d\n\u201cMy husband\u2019s aunt\u201d said Tuppence \u201cMiss Fanshawe.\u201d\n\u201cOh yes.",
    "Yes of course.",
    "I remember now.",
    "And wasn\u2019t there\nsomething about a child of yours behind the chimney piece\u201d\n\u201cNo\u201d said Tuppence \u201cno it wasn\u2019t my child.\u201d\n\u201cBut that\u2019s why you\u2019ve come here isn\u2019t it They\u2019ve had trouble with\na chimney here.",
    "A bird got into it I understand.",
    "This place wants\nrepairing.",
    "I don\u2019t like being here at all.",
    "No not at all and I shall tell\nNellie so as soon as I see her.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cYou\u2019re lodging with Mrs. Perry\u201d\n\u201cWell in a way I am and in a way I\u2019m not.",
    "I think I could trust you\nwith a secret couldn\u2019t I\u201d\n\u201cOh yes\u201d said Tuppence \u201cyou can trust me.\u201d\n\u201cWell I\u2019m not really here at all.",
    "I mean not in this part of the house.",
    "This is the Perrys\u2019 part of the house.\u201d She leaned forward.",
    "\u201cThere\u2019s\nanother one you know if you go upstairs.",
    "Come with me.",
    "I\u2019ll take you.\u201d\nTuppence rose.",
    "She felt that she was in rather a crazy kind of dream.",
    "\u201cI\u2019ll just lock the door first it\u2019s safer\u201d said Mrs. Lancaster.",
    "She led Tuppence up a rather narrow staircase to the first floor.",
    "She\ntook her through a double bedroom with signs of occupation\u2014\npresumably the Perrys\u2019 room\u2014and through a door leading out of that\ninto another room next door.",
    "It contained a washstand and a tall\nwardrobe of maple wood.",
    "Nothing else.",
    "Mrs. Lancaster went to the\nmaple wardrobe fumbled at the back of it then with sudden ease pushed\nit aside.",
    "There seemed to be castors on the wardrobe and it rolled out\nfrom the wall easily enough.",
    "Behind the wardrobe there was rather\nstrangely Tuppence thought a grate.",
    "Over the mantelpiece there was a\nmirror with a small shelf under the mirror on which were china figures of\nbirds.",
    "To Tuppence\u2019s astonishment Mrs. Lancaster seized the bird in the\nmiddle of the mantelshelf and gave it a sharp pull.",
    "Apparently the bird\nwas stuck to the mantelpiece.",
    "In fact by a swift touch Tuppence\nperceived that all the birds were firmly fastened down.",
    "But as a result of\nMrs. Lancaster\u2019s action there was a click and the whole mantelpiece\ncame away from the wall and swung forward.",
    "\u201cClever isn\u2019t it\u201d said Mrs. Lancaster.",
    "\u201cIt was done a long time ago\nyou know when they altered the house.",
    "The priest\u2019s hole you know they\nused to call this room but I don\u2019t think it was really a priest\u2019s hole.",
    "No\nnothing to do with priests.",
    "I\u2019ve never thought so.",
    "Come through.",
    "This is\nwhere I live now.\u201d\nShe gave another push.",
    "The wall in front of her also swung back and\na minute or two later they were in a large attractivelooking room with\nwindows that gave out on the canal and the hill opposite.",
    "\u201cA lovely room isn\u2019t it\u201d said Mrs. Lancaster.",
    "\u201cSuch a lovely view.",
    "I\nalways liked it.",
    "I lived here for a time as a girl you know.\u201d\n\u201cOh I see.\u201d\n\u201cNot a lucky house\u201d said Mrs. Lancaster.",
    "\u201cNo they always said it\nwasn\u2019t a lucky house.",
    "I think you know\u201d she added \u201cI think I\u2019ll shut up\nthis again.",
    "One can\u2019t be too careful can one\u201d\nShe stretched out a hand and pushed the door they had come through\nback again.",
    "There was a sharp click as the mechanism swung into place.",
    "\u201cI suppose\u201d said Tuppence \u201cthat this was one of the alterations they\nmade to the house when they wanted to use it as a hiding place.\u201d\n\u201cThey did a lot of alterations\u201d said Mrs. Lancaster.",
    "\u201cSit down do.",
    "Do you like a high chair or a low one I like a high one myself.",
    "I\u2019m\nrather rheumatic you know.",
    "I suppose you thought there might have\nbeen a child\u2019s body there\u201d added Mrs. Lancaster.",
    "\u201cAn absurd idea really\ndon\u2019t you think so\u201d\n\u201cYes perhaps.\u201d\n\u201cCops and robbers\u201d said Mrs. Lancaster with an indulgent air.",
    "\u201cOne\nis so foolish when one is young you know.",
    "All that sort of thing.",
    "Gangs\n\u2014big robberies\u2014it has such an appeal for one when one is young.",
    "One\nthinks being a gunman\u2019s moll would be the most wonderful thing in the\nworld.",
    "I thought so once.",
    "Believe me\u2014\u201d she leaned forward and tapped\nTuppence on the knee \u201c\u2014believe me it\u2019s not true.",
    "It isn\u2019t really.",
    "I\nthought so once but one wants more than that you know.",
    "There\u2019s no\nthrill really in just stealing things and getting away with it.",
    "It needs good\norganization of course.\u201d\n\u201cYou mean Mrs. Johnson or Miss Bligh\u2014whichever you call her\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWell of course she\u2019s always Nellie Bligh to me.",
    "But for some\nreason or other\u2014to facilitate things she says\u2014she calls herself Mrs.\nJohnson now and then.",
    "But she\u2019s never been married you know.",
    "Oh no.",
    "She\u2019s a regular spinster.\u201d\nA sound of knocking came to them from below.",
    "\u201cDear me\u201d said Mrs. Lancaster \u201cthat must be the Perrys back again.",
    "I\u2019d no idea they were going to be back so soon.\u201d\nThe knocking went on.",
    "\u201cPerhaps we ought to let them in\u201d suggested Tuppence.",
    "\u201cNo dear we won\u2019t do that\u201d said Mrs. Lancaster.",
    "\u201cI can\u2019t stand\npeople always interfering.",
    "We\u2019re having such a nice little talk up here\naren\u2019t we I think we\u2019ll just stay up here\u2014oh dear now they\u2019re calling\nunder the window.",
    "Just look out and see who it is.\u201d\nTuppence went to the window.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s Mr. Perry\u201d she said.",
    "From below Mr. Perry shouted\n\u201cJulia Julia\u201d\n\u201cImpertinence\u201d said Mrs. Lancaster.",
    "\u201cI don\u2019t allow people like Amos\nPerry to call me by my Christian name.",
    "No indeed.",
    "Don\u2019t worry dear\u201d\nshe added \u201cwe\u2019re quite safe here.",
    "And we can have a nice little talk.",
    "I\u2019ll\ntell you all about myself\u2014I\u2019ve really had a very interesting life\u2014\nEventful\u2014Sometimes I think I ought to write it down.",
    "I was mixed up\nyou see.",
    "I was a wild girl and I was mixed up with\u2014well really just a\ncommon gang of criminals.",
    "No other word for it.",
    "Some of them very\nundesirable people.",
    "Mind you there were nice people among them.",
    "Quite\ngood class.\u201d\n\u201cMiss Bligh\u201d\n\u201cNo no Miss Bligh never had anything to do with crime.",
    "Not Nellie\nBligh.",
    "Oh no she\u2019s very churchy you know.",
    "Religious.",
    "All that.",
    "But\nthere are different ways of religion.",
    "Perhaps you know that do you\u201d\n\u201cI suppose there are a lot of different sects\u201d Tuppence suggested.",
    "\u201cYes there have to be for ordinary people.",
    "But there are others\nbesides ordinary people.",
    "There are some special ones under special\ncommands.",
    "There are special legions.",
    "Do you understand what I mean\nmy dear\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I do\u201d said Tuppence.",
    "\u201cDon\u2019t you think we ought to let\nthe Perrys into their own house They\u2019re getting rather upset\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNo we\u2019re not going to let the Perrys in.",
    "Not till\u2014well not till I\u2019ve\ntold you all about it.",
    "You mustn\u2019t be frightened my dear.",
    "It\u2019s all quite\u2014\nquite natural quite harmless.",
    "There\u2019s no pain of any kind.",
    "It\u2019ll be just\nlike going to sleep.",
    "Nothing worse.\u201d\nTuppence stared at her then she jumped up and went towards the\ndoor in the wall.",
    "\u201cYou can\u2019t get out that way\u201d said Mrs. Lancaster.",
    "\u201cYou don\u2019t know\nwhere the catch is.",
    "It\u2019s not where you think it is at all.",
    "Only I know that.",
    "I\nknow all the secrets of this place.",
    "I lived here with the criminals when I\nwas a girl until I went away from them all and got salvation.",
    "Special\nsalvation.",
    "That\u2019s what was given to me\u2014to expiate my sin\u2014The child\nyou know\u2014I killed it.",
    "I was a dancer\u2014I didn\u2019t want a child\u2014Over\nthere on the wall\u2014that\u2019s my picture\u2014as a dancer\u2014\u201d\nTuppence followed the pointing finger.",
    "On the wall hung an oil\npainting full length of a girl in a costume of white satin leaves with the\nlegend \u201cWaterlily.\u201d\n\u201cWaterlily was one of my best roles.",
    "Everyone said so.\u201d\nTuppence came back slowly and sat down.",
    "She stared at Mrs.\nLancaster.",
    "As she did so words repeated in her head.",
    "Words heard at\nSunny Ridge.",
    "\u201cWas it your poor child\u201d She had been frightened then\nfrightened.",
    "She was frightened now.",
    "She was as yet not quite sure what\nshe was frightened of but the same fear was there.",
    "Looking at that\nbenignant face that kindly smile.",
    "\u201cI had to obey the commands given me\u2014There have to be agents of\ndestruction.",
    "I was appointed to that.",
    "I accepted my appointment.",
    "They go\nfree of sin you see.",
    "I mean the children went free of sin.",
    "They were not\nold enough to sin.",
    "So I sent them to Glory as I was appointed to do.",
    "Still\ninnocent.",
    "Still not knowing evil.",
    "You can see what a great honour it was\nto be chosen.",
    "To be one of the specially chosen.",
    "I always loved children.",
    "I had none of my own.",
    "That was very cruel wasn\u2019t it or it seemed cruel.",
    "But it was retribution really for what I\u2019d done.",
    "You know perhaps what\nI\u2019d done.\u201d\n\u201cNo\u201d said Tuppence.",
    "\u201cOh you seem to know so much.",
    "I thought perhaps you\u2019d know that\ntoo.",
    "There was a doctor.",
    "I went to him.",
    "I was only seventeen then and I\nwas frightened.",
    "He said it would be all right to have the child taken away\nso that nobody would ever know.",
    "But it wasn\u2019t all right you see.",
    "I began\nto have dreams.",
    "I had dreams that the child was always there asking me\nwhy it had never had life.",
    "The child told me it wanted companions.",
    "It\nwas a girl you know.",
    "Yes I\u2019m sure it was a girl.",
    "She came and she\nwanted other children.",
    "Then I got the command.",
    "I couldn\u2019t have any\n\n\fchildren.",
    "I\u2019d married and I thought I\u2019d have children then my husband\nwanted children passionately but the children never came because I was\ncursed you see.",
    "You understand that don\u2019t you But there was a way a\nway to atone.",
    "To atone for what I\u2019d done.",
    "What I\u2019d done was murder\nwasn\u2019t it and you could only atone for murder with other murders\nbecause the other murders wouldn\u2019t be really murders they would be\nsacrifices.",
    "They would be offered up.",
    "You do see the difference don\u2019t\nyou The children went to keep my child company.",
    "Children of different\nages but young.",
    "The command would come and then\u2014\u201d she leaned\nforward and touched Tuppence \u201c\u2014it was such a happy thing to do.",
    "You\nunderstand that don\u2019t you It was so happy to release them so that\nthey\u2019d never know sin like I knew sin.",
    "I couldn\u2019t tell anyone of course\nnobody was ever to know.",
    "That was the thing I had to be sure about.",
    "But\nthere were people sometimes who got to know or to suspect.",
    "Then of\ncourse\u2014well I mean it had to be death for them too so that I should be\nsafe.",
    "So I\u2019ve always been quite safe.",
    "You understand don\u2019t you\u201d\n\u201cNot\u2014not quite.\u201d\n\u201cBut you do know.",
    "That\u2019s why you came here isn\u2019t it You knew.",
    "You knew the day I asked you at Sunny Ridge.",
    "I saw by your face.",

    "One of those whose children I\u2019d killed.",
    "I hoped you\u2019d\ncome back another time and then we\u2019d have a glass of milk together.",
    "It\nwas usually milk.",
    "Sometimes cocoa.",
    "Anyone who knew about me.\u201d\nShe moved slowly across the room and opened a cupboard in a\ncorner of the room.",
    "\u201cMrs.",
    "Moody\u2014\u201d said Tuppence \u201cwas she one\u201d\n\u201cOh you know about her\u2014she wasn\u2019t a mother\u2014she\u2019d been a\ndresser at the theatre.",
