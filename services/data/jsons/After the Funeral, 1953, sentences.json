    "AFTER THE FUNERAL\n\nAgatha Christie\n\n\fChapter 1\n\nOld Lanscombe moved totteringly from room to room pulling up the\nblinds.",
    "Now and then he peered with screwed up rheumy eyes through\nthe windows.",
    "Soon they would be coming back from the funeral.",
    "He shuffled along a\nlittle faster.",
    "There were so many windows.",
    "Enderby Hall was a vast Victorian house built in the Gothic style.",
    "In\nevery room the curtains were of rich faded brocade or velvet.",
    "Some of\nthe walls were still hung with faded silk.",
    "In the green drawingroom\nthe old butler glanced up at the portrait above the mantelpiece of old\nCornelius Abernethie for whom Enderby Hall had been built.",
    "Cornelius\nAbernethies brown beard stuck forward aggressively his hand rested\non a terrestrial globe whether by desire of the sitter or as a symbolic\nconceit on the part of the artist no one could tell.",
    "A very forceful looking gentleman so old Lanscombe had always\nthought and was glad that he himself had never known him personally.",
    "Mr Richard had been his gentleman.",
    "A good master Mr Richard.",
    "And\ntaken very sudden hed been though of course the doctor had been\nattending him for some little time.",
    "Ah but the master had never\nrecovered from the shock of young Mr Mortimers death.",
    "The old man\nshook his head as he hurried through a connecting door into the White\nBoudoir.",
    "Terrible that had been a real catastrophe.",
    "Such a fine\nupstanding young gentleman so strong and healthy.",
    "Youd never have\nthought such a thing likely to happen to him.",
    "Pitiful it had been quite\n\n\fpitiful.",
    "And Mr Gordon killed in the war.",
    "One thing on top of another.",
    "That was the way things went nowadays.",
    "Too much for the master it\nhad been.",
    "And yet hed seemed almost himself a week ago.",
    "The third blind in the White Boudoir refused to go up as it should.",
    "It\nwent up a little way and stuck.",
    "The springs were weak  thats what it\nwas  very old these blinds were like everything else in the house.",
    "And you couldnt get these old things mended nowadays.",
    "Too oldfashioned thats what theyd say shaking their heads in that silly\nsuperior way  as if the old things werent a great deal better than the\nnew ones He could tell them that Gimcrack half the new stuff was came to pieces in your hand.",
    "The material wasnt good or the\ncraftsmanship either.",
    "Oh yes could tell them.",
    "Couldnt do anything about this blind unless he got the steps.",
    "He didnt\nlike climbing up the steps much these days made him come over\ngiddy.",
    "Anyway hed leave the blind for now.",
    "It didnt matter since the\nWhite Boudoir didnt face the front of the house where it would be seen\nas the cars came back from the funeral  and it wasnt as though the\nroom was ever used nowadays.",
    "It was a ladys room this and there\nhadnt been a lady at Enderby for a long while now.",
    "A pity Mr Mortimer\nhadnt married.",
    "Always going off to Norway for fishing and to Scotland\nfor shooting and to Switzerland for those winter sports instead of\nmarrying some nice young lady and settling down at home with\nchildren running about the house.",
    "It was a long time since there had\nbeen any children in the house.",
    "And Lanscombes mind went ranging back to a time that stood out\nclearly and distinctly  much more distinctly than the last twenty years\nor so which were all blurred and confused and he couldnt really\n\n\fremember who had come and gone or indeed what they looked like.",
    "But he could remember the old days well enough.",
    "More like a father to those young brothers and sisters of his Mr\nRichard had been.",
    "Twentyfour when his father had died and hed\npitched in right away to the business going off every day as punctual\nas clockwork and keeping the house running and everything as lavish\nas it could be.",
    "A very happy household with all those young ladies and\ngentlemen growing up.",
    "Fights and quarrels now and again of course\nand those governesses had had a bad time of it Poorspirited\ncreatures governesses Lanscombe had always despised them.",
    "Very\nspirited the young ladies had been.",
    "Miss Geraldine in particular.",
    "Miss\nCora too although she was so much younger.",
    "And now Mr Leo was\ndead and Miss Laura gone too.",
    "And Mr Timothy such a sad invalid.",
    "And Miss Geraldine dying somewhere abroad.",
    "And Mr Gordon killed in\nthe war.",
    "Although he was the eldest Mr Richard himself turned out the\nstrongest of the lot.",
    "Outlived them all he had  at least not quite\nbecause Mr Timothy was still alive and little Miss Cora whod married\nthat unpleasant artist chap.",
    "Twentyfive years since hed seen her and\nshed been a pretty young girl when she went off with that chap and\nnow hed hardly have known her grown so stout  and so artycrafty in\nher dress A Frenchman her husband had been or nearly a Frenchman\n and no good ever came of marrying one of them But Miss Cora had\nalways been a bit  well simple like youd call it if shed lived in a\nvillage.",
    "Always one of them in a family.",
    "Shed remembered him all right.",
    "Why its Lanscombe shed said and\nseemed ever so pleased to see him.",
    "Ah theyd all been fond of him in\nthe old days and when there was a dinner party theyd crept down to\nthe pantry and hed gave them jelly and Charlotte Russe when it came\n\n\fout of the diningroom.",
    "Theyd all known old Lanscombe and now\nthere was hardly anyone who remembered.",
    "Just the younger lot whom\nhe could never keep clear in his mind and who just thought of him as a\nbutler whod been there a long time.",
    "A lot of strangers he had thought\nwhen they all arrived for the funeral  and a seedy lot of strangers at\nthat Not Mrs Leo  she was different.",
    "She and Mr Leo had come here\noff and on ever since Mr Leo married.",
    "She was a nice lady Mrs Leo  a\nreal lady.",
    "Wore proper clothes and did her hair well and looked what\nshe was.",
    "And the master had always ben fond of her.",
    "A pity that she\nand Mr Leo had never had any children...\n\nLanscombe roused himself what was he doing standing here and\ndreaming about old days with so much to be done The blinds were all\nattended to on the ground floor now and hed told Janet to go upstairs\nand do the bedrooms.",
    "He and Janet and the cook had gone to the\nfuneral service in the church but instead of going on to the\nCrematorium theyd driven back to the house to get the blinds up and\nthe lunch ready.",
    "Cold lunch of course it had to be.",
    "Ham and chicken\nand tongue and salad.",
    "With cold lemon souffl\u00e9 and apple tart to follow.",
    "Hot soup first  and hed better go along and see that Marjorie had got\nit on ready to serve for theyd be back in a minute or two now for\ncertain.",
    "Lanscombe broke into a shuffling trot across the room.",
    "His gaze\nabstracted and uncurious just swept up to the picture over this\nmantelpiece  the companion portrait to the one in the green drawingroom.",
    "It was a nice painting of white satin and pearls.",
    "The human being\nround whom they were draped and clasped was not nearly so\nimpressive.",
    "Meek features a rosebud mouth hair parted in the middle.",
    "A woman both modest and unassuming.",
    "The only thing really worthy of\nnote about Mrs Cornelius Abernethie had been her name  Coralie.",
    "For\n\nover\n\nsixty\n\nyears\n\nafter\n\ntheir\n\noriginal\n\nappearance\n\nCoral\n\nCornplasters and the allied Coral foot preparations still held their\nown.",
    "Whther there had ever been anything outstanding about Coral\nCornplasters nobody could say  but they had appealed to the public\nfancy.",
    "On a foundation of Coral Cornplasters ther had arisen this neoGothic palace its acres of gardens and the money that had paid out\nan income to seven sons and daughters and had allowed Richard\nAbernethie to die three days ago a very rich man.",
    "II\n\nLooking into the kitchen with a word of admonition Lanscombe was\nsnapped at by Marjorie the cook.",
    "Marjorie was young only twentyseven and was a constant irritation to Lanscombe as being so far\nremoved from what his conception of a proper cook should be.",
    "She\nhad no dignity and no proper appreciation of his Lanscombes\nposition.",
    "She frequently called the house a proper old mausoleum\nand complained of the immense area of the kitchen scullery and\nlarder saying that it was a days walk to get round them all.",
    "She had\nbeen at Enderby two years and only stayed because in the first place\nthe money was good and in the second because Mr Abernethie had\nreally appreciated her cooking.",
    "She cooked very well.",
    "Janet who\nstood by the kitchen table refreshing herself with a cup of tea was an\nelderly housemaid who although enjoying frequent acid disputes with\nLanscombe was nevertheless usually in alliance with him against the\nyounger generation as represented by Marjorie.",
    "The fourth person in\n\n\fthe kitchen was Mrs Jacks who came in to lend assistance where it\nwas wanted and who had much enjoyed the funeral.",
    "Beautiful it was she said with a decorous sniff as she replenished\nher cup.",
    "Nineteen cars and the church quite full and the Canon read\nthe service beautiful I thought.",
    "A nice fine day for it too.",
    "Ah poor dear\nMr Aberenthie theres not many like him left in the world.",
    "Respected\nby all he was.",
    "There was the note of a horn and the sound of a car coming up the\ndrive and Mrs Jacks put down her cup and exclaimed Here they\nare.",
    "Marjorie turned up the gas under her large saucepan of creamy\nchicken soup.",
    "The large kitchen range of the days of Victorian\ngrandeur stood cold and unused like an altar of the past.",
    "The cars drove up one after the other and the people issuing from\nthem in their black clothes moved rather uncertainly across the hall\nand into the big green drawingroom.",
    "In the bigg steel grate a fire was\nburning tribute to the first chill of the autumn days and calculated to\ncounteract the further chill of standing about at a funeral.",
    "Lanscombe entered the room offering glasses of sherry on a silver\ntray.",
    "Mr Entwhistle senior partner of the old and respected firm of Bollard\nEntwhistle Entwhistle and Bollard stood with his back to the fireplace\nwarming himself.",
    "He accepted a glass of sherry and surveyed the\ncompany with his shrewd lawyers gaze.",
    "Not all of them were\n\n\fpersonally known to him and he was under the necessity of sorting\nthem out so to speak.",
    "Introductions before the departure for the\nfuneral had been hushed and perfunctory.",
    "Appraising old Lanscombe first Mr Entwhistle thought to himself\nGetting very shaky poor old chap  going on for ninety I shouldnt\nwonder.",
    "Well hell have that nice little annuity.",
    "Nothing for him to\nworry about.",
    "Faithful soul.",
    "No such thing as oldfashioned service\nnowadays.",
    "Household helps and babysitters God help us all A sad\nworld.",
    "Just as well perhaps poor Richard didnt last his full time.",
    "He\nhadnt much to livefor.",
    "To Mr Entwhistle who was seventytwo Richard Abernethies death at\nsixtyeight was definitively that of a man dead before his time.",
    "Mr\nEntwhistle had retired from active business two years ago but as\nexecutor of Richard Abernethies will and in respect for one of his\noldest clients who was also a personal friend he had made the journey\nto the North.",
    "Reflecting in his own mind on the provisions of the will he mentally\nappraised the family.",
    "Mrs Leo Helen he knew well of course.",
    "A very charming woman for\nwhom he had both liking and respect.",
    "His eyes dwelt approvingly on\nher now as she stoodnear one of the windows.",
    "Black suited her.",
    "She\nhad kept her figure well.",
    "He liked the clear cut features the springing\nline of grey hair back from her temples and the eyes that had once\nbeen likened to cornflowers and which were still quite vividly blue.",
    "How old was Helen now About fiftyone or two he supposed.",
    "Strange\nthat she had never married again after Leos death.",
    "An attractive\nwoman.",
    "Ah but they had been devoted those two.",
    "His eyes went on to Mrs Timothy.",
    "He had never known her very well.",
    "Black didnt suit her  country tweeds were her wear.",
    "Shed always\nbeen a good devoted wife to Timothy.",
    "Looking after his health fussing\nover him  fussing over him a bit too much probably.",
    "Was there really\nanything the matter with Timothy Just a hypochondriac Mr\nEntwhistle suspected.",
    "Richard Abernethie had suspected so too.",
    "Weak chest of course when he was a boy he had said.",
    "But blest if\nI think theres much wrong with him now.",
    "Oh well everybody had to\nhave some hobby.",
    "Timothys hobby was the all absorbing one of his\nown health.",
    "Was Mrs Tim taken in Probably not  but women never\nadmitted that sort of thing.",
    "Timothy must be quite comfortably off.",
    "Hed\nnever been a spendthrift.",
    "However the extra would not come amiss not in these days of taxation.",
    "Hed probably had to retrench his scale\nof living a good deal since the war.",
    "Mr Entwhistle transferred his attention to George Crossfield Lauras\nson.",
    "Dubious sort of fellow Laura had married.",
    "Nobody had ever\nknown much about him.",
    "A stockbroker he had called himself.",
    "Young\nGeorge was in a solicitors office  not a very reputable firm.",
    "Goodlooking young fellow  but something a little shifty about him.",
    "He\ncouldnt have too much to live on.",
    "Laura had been a complete fool over\nher investments.",
    "Shed left next to nothing when she died five years\nago.",
    "A handsome romantic girl shed been but no money sense.",
    "Mr Entwhistles eyes went on from George Crossfield.",
    "Which of the two\ngirls was which Ah yes that was Rosamund Geraldines daughter\n\n\flooking at the wax flowers on the malachite table.",
    "Pretty girl beautiful\nin fact  rather a silly face.",
    "On the stage.",
    "Repertory companies or some\nnonsense like that.",
    "Had married an actor too.",
    "Goodlooking fellow.",
    "And knows he is thought Mr Entwhistle who was prejudiced against\nthe stage as a profession.",
    "Wonder what sort of a background he has\nand where he comes from.",
    "He looked disapprovingly at Michael Shane with his fair hair and his\nhaggard charm.",
    "Now Susan Gordons daughter would do much better on the stage\nthan Rosamund.",
    "More personality.",
    "A little too much personality for\neveryday life perhaps.",
    "She was quite near him and Mr Entwhistle\nstudied her covertly.",
    "Dark hair hazel  almost goldeneyes a sulky\nattractive mouth.",
    "Beside her was the husband she had just married  a\nchemists assistant he understood.",
    "Really a chemists assistant In Mr\nEntwhistles creed girls did not marry young men who served behind a\ncounter.",
    "But now of course they married anybody The young man\nwho had a pale nondescript face seemed very ill at ease.",
    "Mr\nEntwhistle wondered why but decided charitably that it was the strain\nof meeting so many of his wifes relations.",
    "Last in his survey Mr Entwhistle came to Cora Lansquenet.",
    "There was\na certain justice in that for Cora had decidedly been an afterthought in\nthe family.",
    "Richards youngest sister she had been born when her\nmother was just on fifty and that meek woman had not survived her\ntenth pregnancy three children had died in infancy.",
    "Poor little Cora\nAll her life Cora had been rather an embarassment growing up tall\nand gawky and given to blurting out remarks that had always better\nhave remained unsaid.",
    "All her elder brothers and sisters had been\n\n\fvery kind to Cora atoning for her deficiencies and covering her social\nmistakes.",
    "It had never really occurred to anyonethat Cora would\nmarry.",
    "She had not been a very attractive girl and her rather obvious\nadvances to visiting young men had usually caused the latter to retreat\nin some alarm.",
    "And then Mr Entwhistle mused there had come the\nLansquenet business  Pierre Lansquenet half French whom she had\ncome across in an Art school where she had been having very correct\nlessons in painting flowers in water colours.",
    "But somehow she had got\ninto the Life class and there she had met Pierre Lansquenet and had\ncome home and announced her intention of marrying him.",
    "Richard\nAbernethie had put his foot down  he hadnt liked what he saw of\nPierre Lansquenet and suspected that the young man was really in\nsearch of a rich wife.",
    "But whilst he was making a few researches into\nLansquenets antecedents Cora had bolted with the fellow and\nmarried him out of hand.",
    "They had spent most of their married lifein\nBrittany and Cornwall and other painters conventional haunts.",
    "Lansquenet had been a very bad painter and not by all accounts a\nvery nice man but Cora had remained devoted to him and had never\nforgiven her family for their attitude to him.",
    "Richard had generously\nmade his young sister an allowance and on that they had so Mr\nEntwhistle believed lived.",
    "He doubted if Lansquenet had ever earned\nany money at all.",
    "He must have been dead now twelve years or more\nthought Mr Entwhistle.",
    "And now here was his widow rather cushionlike in shape and dressed in wispy artistic black with festoons of jet\nbeads back in the home of her girlhood moving about and touching\nthings and exclaiming with pleasure when she recalled some childish\nmemory.",
    "She made very little pretence of grief at her brothers death.",
    "But then Mr Entwhistle reflected Cora had never pretended.",
    "Reentering the room Lanscombe murmured in muted tones suitable to\nthe occasion\n\nLuncheon is served.",
    "Chapter 2\n\nAfter the delicious chicken soup and plenty of cold viands\naccompanied by an excellent chablis the funeral atmosphere\nlightened.",
    "Nobody had really felt any deep grief for Richard\nAbernethies death since none of them had had any close ties with him.",
    "Their behaviour had been suitably decorous and subdued with the\nexception of the uninhibited Cora who was clearly enjoying herself but\nit was now felt that the decencies had been observed and that normal\nconversation could be resumed.",
    "Mr Entwhistle encouraged this\nattitude.",
    "He was experienced in funerals and knew exactly how to set\ncorrect funeral timing.",
    "After the meal was over Lanscombe indicated the library for coffee.",
    "This was his feeling for niceties.",
    "The time had come when business in\nother words The Will  would be discussed.",
    "The library had the proper\natmosphere for that with its bookshelves and its heavy red velvet\ncurtains.",
    "He served coffee to them there and then withdrew closing\nthe door.",
    "After a few desultory remarks everyone began to look tentatively at\nMr Entwhistle.",
    "He responded promptly after glancing at his watch.",
    "I have to catch the 3.30 train he began.",
    "Others it seemed also had to catch that train.",
    "As you know said Mr Entwhistle I am the executor of Richard\nAbernethies will \n\nHe was interrupted.",
    "I didnt know said Cora Lansquenet brightly.",
    "Are you Did he leave\nme anything\n\nNot for the first time Mr Entwhistle felt that Cora was too apt to speak\nout of turn.",
    "Bending a repressive glance at her he continued\n\nUp to a year ago Richard Abernethies will was very simple.",
    "Subject\nto certain legacies he left everything to his son Mortimer.",
    "Poor Mortimer said Cora.",
    "I do think all this infantile paralysis is\ndreadful.",
    "Mortimers death coming so suddenly and tragically was a great\nblow to Richard.",
    "It took him some months to rally from it.",
    "I pointed out\nto him that it might be advisable for him to make new testamentary\ndispositions.",
    "Maude Abernethie asked in her deep voice\n\nWhat would have happened if he hadnt made a new will Would it would it all have gone to Timothy  as the next of kin I mean\n\n\fMr Entwhistle opened his month to give a disquisition on the subject of\nnext of kin thought better of it and said crisply\n\nOn my advice Richard decided to make a new will.",
    "First of all\nhowever he decided to get better acquainted with the younger\ngeneration.",
    "He had us upon appro said Susan with a sudden rich laugh.",
    "First\nGeorge and then Greg and then Rosamund and Michael.",
    "Gregory Banks said sharply his thin face flushing\n\nI don t think you ought to put it like that Susan.",
    "On appro indeed\n\nBut that was what it was wasnt it Mr Entwhistle\n\nDid he leave me anything repeated Cora.",
    "Mr Entwhistle coughed and spoke rather coldly\n\nI propose to send you all copies of the will.",
    "I can read it to you in full\nnow if you like but its legal phraseology may seem to you rather\nobscure.",
    "Briefly it amounts to this After certain small bequests and a\nsubstantial legacy to Lanscombe to purchase an annuity the bulk of\nthe estate  a very considerable one  is to be divided into six equal\nportions.",
    "Four of these after all duties are paid are to go to Richards\nbrother Timothy his nephew George Crossfield his niece Susan\nBanks and his niece Rosamund Shane.",
    "The other two portions are to\nbe held upon trust and the income from them paid to Mrs Helen\n\n\fAbernethie the widow of his brother Leo and to his sister Mrs Cora\nLansquenet during their lifetime.",
    "The capital after their death to be\ndivided between the other four beneficiaries or their issue.",
    "Thats very nice said Cora Lansquenet with real appreciation.",
    "An\nincome How much\n\nI  er  cant say exactly at present.",
    "Death duties of course will be\nheavy and \n\nCant you give me any idea\n\nMr Entwhistle realised that Cora must be appeased.",
    "Possibly somewhere in the neighbourhood of three to four thousand a\nyear.",
    "Goody said Cora.",
    "I shall go to Capri.",
    "Helen Abernethie said softly\n\nHow very kind and generous of Richard.",
    "I do appreciate his affection\ntowards me.",
    "He was very fond of you said Mr Entwhistle.",
    "Leo was his favourite\nbrother and your visits to him were always much appreciated after Leo\ndied.",
    "Helen said regretfully\n\n\fI wish I had realised how ill he was  I came up to see him not long\nbefore he died but although I knew he had been ill I did not think it\nwas serious.",
    "It was always serious said Mr Entwhistle.",
    "But he did not want it\ntalked about and I do not believe that anybody expected the end to\ncome as soon as it did.",
    "The doctor was quite surprised I know.",
    "Suddenly at his residence thats what it said in the paper said\nCora nodding her head.",
    "I wondered then.",
    "It was a shock to all of us said Maude Abernethie.",
    "It upset poor\nTimothy dreadfully.",
    "So sudden he kept saying.",
    "So sudden.",
    "Still its been hushed up very nicely hasnt it said Cora.",
    "Everybody stared at her and she seemed a little flustered.",
    "I think youre all quite right she said hurriedly.",
    "Quite right.",
    "I mean it cant do any good  making it public.",
    "Very unpleasant for everybody.",
    "It should be kept strictly in the family.",
    "The faces turned towards her looked even more blank.",
    "Mr Entwhistle leaned forward\n\nReally Cora Im afraid I dont quite understand what you mean.",
    "Cora Lansquenet looked round at the family in wideeyed surprise.",
    "She\ntilted her head on one side with a birdlike movement.",
    "But he was murdered wasnt he she said.",
    "Chapter 3\n\nTravelling to London in the corner of a firstclass carriage Mr\nEntwhistle gave himself up to somewhat uneasy thought over that\nextraordinary remark made by Cora Lansquenet.",
    "Of course Cora was\na rather unbalanced and excessively stupid woman and she had been\nnoted even as a girl for the embarrassing manner in which she had\nblurted out unwelcome truths.",
    "At least he didnt mean truths  that was\nquite the wrong word to use.",
    "Awkward statements  that was a much\nbetter term.",
    "In his mind he went back over the immediate sequence to that\nunfortunate remark.",
    "The combined stare of many startled and\ndisapproving eyes had roused Cora to a sense of the enormity of what\nshe had said.",
    "Maude had exclaimed Really Cora George had said My dear Aunt\nCora.",
    "Somebody else had said What do you mean\n\nAnd at once Cora Lansquenet abashed and convicted of enormity\nhad burst into fluttering phrases.",
    "Oh Im sorry  I didnt mean  oh of course it was very stupid of me\nbut I did think from what he said  Oh of course I know its quite all\nright but his death was so sudden  please forget that I said anything\nat all  I didnt mean to be so stupid  I know Im always saying the\nwrong thing.",
    "And then the momentary upset had died down and there had been a\npractical discussion about the disposition of the late Richard\nAbernethies personal effects.",
    "The house and its contents Mr\nEntwhistle supplemented would be put up for sale.",
    "Coras unfortunate gaffe had been forgotten.",
    "After all Cora had\nalways been if not subnormal at any rate embarrassingly na\u00efve.",
    "She\nhad never had any idea of what should or should not be said.",
    "At\nnineteen it had not mattered so much.",
    "The mannerisms of an enfant\nterrible can persist to then but an enfant terrible of nearly fifty is\ndecidedly disconcerting.",
    "To blurt out unwelcome truths \n\nMr Entwhistles train of thought came to an abrupt check.",
    "It was the\nsecond time that that disturbing word had occurred.",
    "Truths.",
    "And why\nwas it so disturbing Because of course that had always been at the\nbottom of the embarrassment that Coras outspoken comments had\ncaused.",
    "It was because her na\u00efve statements had been either true or\nhad contained some\n\ngrain of\n\ntruth that they had\n\nbeen\n\nso\n\nembarrassing\n\nAlthough in the plump woman of fortynine Mr Entwhistle had been\nable to see little resemblance to the gawky girl of earlier days certain\nof Coras mannerisms had persisted  the slight birdlike twist of the\nhead as she brought out a particularly outrageous remark  a kind of\nair of pleased expectancy.",
    "In just such a way had Cora once\ncommented on the figure of the kitchenmaid.",
    "Mollie can hardly get\nnear the kitchen table her stomach sticks out so.",
    "Its only been like\nthat the last month or two.",
    "I wonder why shes getting so fat\n\n\fCora had been quickly hushed.",
    "The Abernethie household was\nVictorian in tone.",
    "The kitchenmaid had disappeared from the\npremises the next day and after due inquiry the second gardener had\nbeen ordered to make an honest woman of her and had been\npresented with a cottage in which to do so.",
    "Faroff memories  but they had their point...\n\nMr Entwhistle examined his uneasiness more closely.",
    "What was there\nin Coras ridiculous remarks that had remained to tease his\nsubconscious in this manner Presently he isolated two phrases.",
    "I\ndid think from what he said  and his death was so sudden...\n\nMr Entwhistle examined that last remark first.",
    "Yes Richards death\ncould in a fashion be considered sudden.",
    "Mr Entwhistle had\ndiscussed Richards health both with Richard himself and with his\ndoctor.",
    "The latter had indicated plainly that a long life could not be\nexpected.",
    "If Mr Abernethie took reasonable care of himself he might\nlive two or even three years.",
    "Perhaps longer  but that was unlikely.",
    "In\nany case the doctor had anticipated no collapse in the near future.",
    "Well the doctor had been wrong  but doctors as they were the first to\nadmit themselves could never be sure about the individual reaction of\na patient to disease.",
    "Cases given up unexpectedly recovered.",
    "Patients on the way to recovery relapsed and died.",
    "So much\ndepended on the vitality of the patient.",
    "On his own inner urge to live.",
    "And Richard Abernethie though a strong and vigorous man had had\nno great incentive to live.",
    "For six months previously his only surviving son Mortimer had\ncontracted infantile paralysis and had died within a week.",
    "His death\nhad been a shock greatly augmented by the fact that he had been such\na particularly strong and vital young man.",
    "A keen sportsman he was\nalso a good athlete and was one of those people of whom it was said\nthat he had never had a days illness in his life.",
    "He was on the point of\nbecoming engaged to a very charming girl and his fathers hopes for\nthe future were centred in this dearly loved and thoroughly\nsatisfactory son of his.",
    "Instead had come tragedy.",
    "And besides the sense of personal loss the\nfuture had held little to stir Richard Abernethies interest.",
    "One son had\ndied in infancy the second without issue.",
    "He had no grandchildren.",
    "There was in fact no one of the Abernethie name to come after him\nand he was the holder of a vast fortune with wide business interests\nwhich he himself still controlled to a certain extent.",
    "Who was to\nsucceed to that fortune and to the control of those interests\n\nThat this had worried Richard deeply Entwhistle knew.",
    "His only\nsurviving brother was very much of an invalid.",
    "There remained the\nyounger generation.",
    "It had been in Richards mind the lawyer thought\nthough his friend had not actually said so to choose one definite\nsuccessor though minor legacies would probably have been made.",
    "Anyway as Entwhistle knew within the last six months Richard\nAbernethie had invited to stay with him in succession his nephew\nGeorge his niece Susan and her husband his niece Rosamund and\nher husband and his sisterinlaw Mrs Leo Abernethie.",
    "It was amongst the first three so the lawyer thought that Abernethie\nhad looked for his successor.",
    "Helen Abernethie he thought had been\n\n\fasked out of personal affection and even possibly as someone to\nconsult for Richard had always held a high opinion of her good sense\nand practical judgment.",
    "Mr Entwhistle also remembered that sometime during that six months\nperiod Richard had paid a short visit to his brother Timothy.",
    "The net result had been the will which the lawyer now carried in his\nbriefcase.",
    "An equable distribution of property.",
    "The only conclusion\nthat could be drawn therefore was that he had been disappointed\nboth in his nephew and in his nieces  or perhaps in his nieces\nhusbands.",
    "As far as Mr Entwhistle knew he had not invited his sister Cora\nLansquenet to visit him  and that brought the lawyer back to that first\ndisturbing phrase that Cora had let slip so incoherently  but I did\nthink from what he said \n\nWhat had Richard Abernethie said And when had he said it If Cora\nhad not been to Enderby then Richard Abernethie must have visited\nher at the artistic village in Berkshire where she had a cottage.",
    "Or was\nit something that Richard had said in a letter\n\nMr Entwhistle frowned.",
    "Cora of course was a very stupid woman.",
    "She\ncould easily have misinterpreted a phrase and twisted its meaning.",
    "But he did wonder what the phrase could have been...",
    "There was enough uneasiness in him to make him consider the\npossibility of approaching Mrs Lansquenet on the subject.",
    "Not too\nsoon.",
    "Better not make it seem of importance.",
    "But he would like to know\n\n\fjust what it was that Richard Abernethie had said to her which had led\nher to pipe up so briskly with that outrageous question\n\nBut he was murdered wasnt he\n\nII\n\nIn a thirdclass carriage farther along the train Gregory Banks said to\nhis wife\n\nThat aunt of yours must be completely bats\n\nAunt Cora Susan was vague.",
    "Oh yes I believe she was always a\nbit simple or something.",
    "George Crossfield sitting opposite said sharply\n\nShe really ought to be stopped from going about saying things like\nthat.",
    "It might put ideas into peoples heads.",
    "Rosamund Shane intent on outlining the cupids bow of her mouth with\nlipstick murmured vaguely\n\nI dont suppose anyone would pay any attention to what a frump like\nthat says.",
    "The most peculiar clothes and lashings and lashings of jet \n\nWell I think it ought to be stopped said George.",
    "All right darling laughed Rosamund putting away her lipstick and\ncontemplating her image with satisfaction in the mirror.",
    "You stop it.",
    "Her husband said unexpectedly\n\nI think George is right.",
    "Its so easy to set people talking.",
    "Well would it matter Rosamund contemplated the question.",
    "The\ncupids bow lifted at the corners in a smile.",
    "It might really be rather\nfun.",
    "Fun Four voices spoke.",
    "Having a murder in the family said Rosamund.",
    "Thrilling you know\n\nIt occurred to that nervous and unhappy young man Gregory Banks\nthat Susans cousin setting aside her attractive exterior might have\nsome faint points of resemblance to her Aunt Cora.",
    "Her next words\nrather confirmed his impression.",
    "If he was murdered said Rosamund who do you think did it\n\nHer gaze travelled thoughtfully round the carriage.",
    "His death has been awfully convenient for all of us she said\nthoughtfully.",
    "Michael and I are absolutely on our beam ends.",
    "Micks\nhad a really good part offered to him in the Sandborne show if he can\nafford to wait for it.",
    "Now well be in clover.",
    "Well be able to back our\nown show if we want to.",
    "As a matter of fact theres a play with a simply\nwonderful part.",
    "Nobody listened to Rosamunds ecstatic disquisition.",
    "Their attention\nhad shifted to their own immediate future.",
    "Touch and go thought George to himself.",
    "Now I can put that money\nback and nobody will ever know...",
    "But its been a near shave.",
    "Gregory closed his eyes as he lay back against the seat.",
    "Escape from\nbondage.",
    "Susan said in her clear rather hard voice Im very sorry of course\nfor poor old Uncle Richard.",
    "But then he was very old and Mortimer\nhad died and hed nothing to live for and it would have been awful for\nhim to go on as an invalid year after year.",
    "Much better for him to pop\noff suddenly like this with no fuss.",
    "Her hard confident young eyes softened as they watched her\nhusbands absorbed face.",
    "She adored Greg.",
    "She sensed vaguely that\nGreg cared for her less than she cared for him  but that only\nstrengthened her passion.",
    "Greg was hers shed do anything for him.",
    "Anything at all...\n\nIII\n\nMaude Abernethie changing her dress for dinner at Enderby for she\nwas staying the night wondered if she ought to have offered to stay\nlonger to help Helen out with the sorting and clearing of the house.",
    "There would be all Richards personal things...",
    "There might be\nletters... All important papers she supposed had already been taken\npossession of by Mr Entwhistle.",
    "And it really was necessary for her to\nget back to Timothy as soon as possible.",
    "He fretted so when she was\n\n\fnot there to look after him.",
    "She hoped he would be pleased about the\nwill and not annoyed.",
    "He had expected she knew that most of\nRichards fortune would come to him.",
    "After all he was the only\nsurviving Abernethie.",
    "Richard could surely have trusted him to look\nafter the younger generation.",
    "Yes she was afraid Timothy would be\nannoyed... And that was so bad for his digestion.",
    "And really when he\nwas annoyed Timothy could become quite unreasonable.",
    "There were\ntimes when he seemed to lose his sense of proportion... She wondered\nif she ought to speak to Dr Barton about it... Those sleeping pills Timothy had been taking far too many of them lately  he got so angry\nwhen she wanted to keep the bottle for him.",
    "But they could be\ndangerous  Dr Barton had said so  you could get drowsy and forget\nyoud taken them  and then take more.",
    "And then anything might\nhappen There certainly werent as many left in the bottle as there\nought to be... Timothy was really very naughty about medicines.",
    "He\nwouldnt listen to her...",
    "He was very difficult sometimes.",
    "She sighed  then brightened.",
    "Things were going to be much easier\nnow.",
    "The garden for instance \n\nIV\n\nHelen Abernethie sat by the fire in the green drawingroom waiting for\nMaude to come down to dinner.",
    "She looked round her remembering old days here with Leo and the\nothers.",
    "It had been a happy house.",
    "But a house like this needed\npeople.",
    "It needed children and servants and big meals and plenty of\nroaring fires in winter.",
    "It had been a sad house when it had been lived\nin by one old man who had lost his son...\n\n\fWho would buy it she wondered Would it be turned into an hotel or\nan institute or perhaps one of those hostels for young people That\nwas what happened to these vast houses nowadays.",
    "No one would buy\nthem to live in.",
    "It would be pulled down perhaps and the whole estate\nbuilt over.",
    "It made her sad to think of that but she pushed the sadness\naside resolutely.",
    "It did one no good to dwell on the past.",
    "This house\nand happy days here and Richard and Leo all that was good but it\nwas over.",
    "She had her own activities and friends and interests.",
    "Yes\nher interests... And now with the income Richard had left her she\nwould be able to keep on the villa in Cyprus and do all the things she\nhad planned to do.",
    "How worried she had been lately over money  taxation  all those\ninvestments going wrong... Now thanks to Richards money all that\nwas over...\n\nPoor Richard.",
    "To die in his sleep like that had been really a great\nmercy...",
    "Suddenly on the 22nd  she supposed that that was what had\nput the idea into Coras head.",
    "Really Cora was outrageous She always\nhad been.",
    "Helen remembered meeting her once abroad soon after her\nmarriage to Pierre Lansquenet.",
    "She had been particularly foolish and\nfatuous that day twisting her head sideways and making dogmatic\nstatements about painting and particularly about her husbands\npainting which must have been most uncomfortable for him.",
    "No man\ncould like his wife appearing such a fool.",
    "And Cora was a fool Oh\nwell poor thing she couldnt help it and that husband of hers hadnt\ntreated her too well.",
    "Helens gaze rested absently on a bouquet of wax flowers that stood\non a round malachite table.",
    "Cora had been sitting beside it when they\nhad all been sitting round waiting to start for the church.",
    "She had been\nfull of reminiscences and delighted recognitions of various things and\nwas clearly so pleased at being back in her old home that she had\ncompletely lost sight of the reason for which they were assembled.",
    "But perhaps thought Helen she was just less of a hypocrite than\nthe rest of us...\n\nCora had never been one for observing the conventions.",
    "Look at the\nway she had plumped out that question But he was murdered wasnt\nhe\n\nThe faces all round startled shocked staring at her Such a variety of\nexpressions there must have been on those faces...\n\nAnd suddenly seeing the picture clearly in her mind Helen frowned...",
    "There was something wrong with that picture...\n\nSomething...\n\nSomebody...\n\nWas it an expression on someones face Was that it Something that how could she put it  ought not to have been there...\n\nShe didnt know... she couldnt place it... but there had been something\n somewhere  wrong.",
    "V\n\nMeanwhile in the buffet at Swindon a lady in wispy mourning and\nfestoons of jet was eating bath buns and drinking tea and looking\nforward to the future.",
    "She had no premonitions of disaster.",
    "She was\nhappy.",
    "These crosscountry journeys were certainly tiring.",
    "It would have been\neasier to get back to Lytchett St Mary via London  and not so very\nmuch more expensive.",
    "Ah but expense didnt matter now.",
    "Still she\nwould have had to travel with the family  probably having to talk all the\nway.",
    "Too much of an effort.",
    "No better go home crosscountry.",
    "These bath buns were really\nexcellent.",
    "Extraordinary how hungry a funeral made you feel.The soup\nat Enderby had been delicious  and so was the cold souffl\u00e9.",
    "How smug people were  and what hypocrites All those faces  when\nshed said that about murder The way theyd all looked at her\n\nWell it had been the right thing to say.",
    "She nodded her head in\nsatisfied approval of herself.",
    "Yes it had been the right thing to do.",
    "She glanced up at the clock.",
    "Five minutes before her train went.",
    "She\ndrank up her tea.",
    "Not very good tea.",
    "She made a grimace.",
    "For a moment or two she sat dreaming.",
    "Dreaming of the future\nunfolding before her... She smiled like a happy child.",
    "She was really going to enjoy herself at last... She went out to the small\nbranch line train busily making plans...\n\nChapter 4\n\nMr Entwhistle passed a very restless night.",
    "He felt so tired and so\nunwell in the morning that he did not get up.",
    "His sister who kept house for him brought up his breakfast on a tray\nand explained to him severely how wrong he had been to go gadding\noff to the North of England at his age and in his frail state of health.",
    "Mr Entwhistle contented himself with saying that Richard Abernethie\nhad been a very old friend.",
    "Funerals said his sister with deep disapproval.",
    "Funerals are\nabsolutely fatal for a man of your age Youll be taken off as suddenly\nas your precious Mr Abernethie was if you dont take more care of\nyourself.",
    "The word suddenly made Mr Entwhistle wince.",
    "It also silenced him.",
    "He did not argue.",
    "He was well aware of what had made him flinch at the word suddenly.",
    "Cora Lansquenet What she had suggested was definitely quite\nimpossible but all the same he would like to find out exactly why she\nhad suggested it.",
    "Yes he would go down to Lytchett St Mary and see\nher.",
    "He could pretend that it was business connected with probate\nthat he needed her signature.",
    "No need to let her guess that he had\n\n\fpaid any attention to her silly remark.",
    "But he would go down and see\nher  and he would do it soon.",
    "He finished his breakfast and lay back on his pillows and read The\nTimes.",
    "He found The Times very soothing.",
    "It was about a quarter to six that evening when his telephone rang.",
    "He picked it up.",
    "The voice at the other end of the wire was that of Mr\nJames Parrott the present second partner of Bollard Entwhistle\nEntwhistle and Bollard.",
    "Look here Entwhistle said Mr Parrott Ive just been rung up by the\npolice from a place called Lytchett St Mary.",
    "Lytchett St Mary\n\nYes.",
    "It seems  Mr Parrott paused a moment.",
    "He seemed\nembarrassed.",
    "Its about a Mrs Cora Lansquenet.",
    "Wasnt she one of\nthe heirs of the Abernethie estate\n\nYes of course.",
    "I saw her at the funeral yesterday.",
    "Oh She was at the funeral was she\n\nYes.",
    "What about her\n\nWell Mr Parrott sounded apologetic.",
    "Shes  its really most\nextraordinary  shes been well  murdered.",
    "Mr Parrott said the last word with the uttermost deprecation.",
    "It was not\nthe sort of word he suggested that ought to mean anything to the firm\nof Bollard Entwhistle Entwhistle and Bollard.",
    "Murdered\n\nYes  yes  Im afraid so.",
    "Well I mean theres no doubt about it.",
    "How did the police get on to us\n\nHer companion or housekeeper or whatever she is  a Miss Gilchrist.",
    "The police asked for the name of her nearest relative or of her\nsolicitors.",
    "And this Miss Gilchrist seemed rather doubtful about\nrelatives and their addresses but she knew about us.",
    "So they got\nthrough at once.",
    "What makes them think she was murdered demanded Mr\nEntwhistle.",
    "Mr Parrott sounded apologetic again.",
    "Oh well it seems there cant be any doubt about that  I mean it was a\nhatchet or something of that kind  a very violent sort of crime.",
    "Robbery\n\nThats the idea.",
    "A window was smashed and there are some trinkets\nmissing and drawers pulled out and all that but the police seem to\nthink there might be something  well  phony about it.",
    "What time did it happen\n\nSometime between two and fourthirty this afternoon.",
    "Where was the housekeeper\n\nChanging library books in Reading.",
    "She got back about five oclock\nand found Mrs Lansquenet dead.",
    "The police want to know if weve any\nidea of who could have been likely to attack her.",
    "I said Mr Parrotts\nvoice sounded outraged that I thought it was a most unlikely thing to\nhappen.",
    "Yes of course.",
    "It must be some halfwitted local oaf  who thought there might be\nsomething to steal and then lost his head and attacked her.",
    "That must\nbe it  eh dont you think so Entwhistle\n\nYes yes... Mr Entwhistle spoke absentmindedly.",
    "Parrott was right he told himself.",
    "That was what must have\nhappened...",
    "But uncomfortably he heard Coras voice saying brightly\n\nHe was murderd wasnt he\n\nSuch a fool Cora.",
    "Always had been.",
    "Rushing in where angels fear to\ntread... Blurting out unpleasnt truths...\n\n\fTruths\n\nThat blasted word again...\n\nII\n\nMr Entwhistle and Inspector Morton looked at each other appraisingly.",
    "In his neat precise manner Mr Entwhistle had placed at the Inspectors\ndisposal all the relevant facts about Cora Lansquenet.",
    "Her upbringing\nher marriage her widowhood her financial position her relatives.",
    "Mr Timothy Abernethie is her only surviving brother and her next of\nkin but he is a recluse and an invalid and is quite unable to leave\nhome.",
    "He has empowered me to act for him and to make all such\narrangements as may be ncecessary.",
    "The Inspector nodded.",
    "It was a relief for him to have this shrewd\nelderly solicitor to deal with.",
    "Moreover he hoped that the lawyer might\nbe able to give him some assistance in solving what was beginning to\nlook like a rather puzzling problem.",
    "He said\n\nI understand from Miss Gilchrist that Mrs Lansquenet had been North\nto the funeral of an elder brother on the day before her death\n\nThat is so Inspector.",
    "I myself was there.",
    "There was nothing unusual in her manner  nothing strange  or\napprehensive\n\nMr Entwhistle raised his eyebrows in wellsimulated surprise.",
    "Is it customary for there to be something strange in the manner of a\nperson who is shortly to be murdered he asked.",
    "The Inspector smiled rather ruefully.",
    "Im not thinking of her being fey or having a premonition.",
    "No Im just\nhunting around for  something well something out of the ordinary.",
    "I dont think I quite understand you Inspector said Mr Entwhistle.",
    "Its not a very easy case to understand Mr Entwhistle.",
    "Say someone\nwatched the Gilchrist woman come out of the house at about two\noclock and go along to the village and the bus stop.",
    "This someone\nthen deliberately takes the hatchet that was lying by the woodshed\nsmashes the kitchen window with it gets into the house goes\nupstairs attacks Mrs Lansquenet with the hatchet  and attacks her\nsavagely.",
    "Six or eight blows were struck.",
    "Mr Entwhistle flinched  Oh\nyes quite a brutal crime.",
    "Then the intruder pulls out a few drawers\nscoops up a few trinkets  worth perhaps a tenner in all and clears\noff.",
    "She was in bed\n\n\fYes.",
    "It seems she returned late from the North the night before\nexhausted and very excited.",
    "Shed come into some legacy as I\nunderstand\n\nYes.",
    "She slept very badly and woke with a terrible headache.",
    "She had\nseveral cups of tea and took some dope for her head and then told\nMiss Gilchrist not to disturb her till lunchtime.",
    "She felt no better and\ndecided to take two sleeping pills.",
    "She then sent Miss Gilchrist into\nReading by the bus to change some library books.",
    "Shed have been\ndrowsy if not already asleep when this man broke in.",
    "He could have\ntaken what he wanted by means of threats or he could easily have\ngagged her.",
    "A hatchet deliberatly taken up with him from outside\nseems excessive.",
    "He may just have meant to threatne her with it Mr Entwhistle\nsuggested.",
    "If she showed fight then \n\nAccording to the medical evidence there is no sign that she did.",
    "Everything seems to show that she was lying on her side sleeping\npeacefully when she was attacked.",
    "Mr Entwhistle shifted uneasily in his chair.",
    "One does hear of these brutal and rather senseless murders he\npointed out.",
    "Oh yes yes thats probably what it will turn out to be.",
    "Theres an\nalert out of course for any suspicious character.",
    "Nobody local is\n\n\fconcerned were pretty sure of that.",
    "The locals are all accounted for\nsatisfactorily.",
    "Most people are at work at that time of day.",
    "Of course\nher cottage is up a lane outside the village proper.",
    "Anyone could get\nthere easily without being seen.",
    "Theres a maze of lanes all round the\nvillage.",
    "It was a fine morning and there has been no rain for some\ndays so there arent any distinctive car tracks to go by  in case\nanyone came by car.",
    "You think someone came by car Mr Entwhistle asked sharply.",
    "The Inspector shrugged his shoulders.",
    "I dont know.",
    "All Im saying is\nthere are curious features about the case.",
    "These for instance  He\nshoved across his desk a handful of things  a trefoilshaped brooch\nwith small pearls a brooch set with amethysts a small string of seed\npearls and a garnet bracelet.",
    "Those are the things that were taken from her jewel box.",
    "They were\nfound just outside the house shoved into a bush.",
    "Yes  yes that is rather curious.",
    "Perhaps if her assailant was\nfrightened at what he had done \n\nQuite.",
    "But he would probably then have left them upstairs in her\nroom.",
    "Of course a panic may have come over him between the\nbedroom and the front gate.",
    "Mr Entwhistle said quietly\n\nOr they may as you are suggesting have only been taken as a blind.",
    "Yes several possibilities... Of course this Gilchrist woman may have\ndone it.",
    "Two women living alone together  you never know what\nquarrels or resentments or passions may have been aroused.",
    "Oh yes\nwere taking that possibility into consideration as well.",
    "But it doesnt\nseem very likely.",
    "From all accounts they were on quite amicable\nterms.",
    "He paused before going on.",
    "According to you nobody stands\nto gain by Mrs Lansquenets death\n\nThe lawyer shifted uneasily.",
    "I didnt quite say that.",
    "Inspector Morton looked up sharply.",
    "I thought you said that Mrs Lansquenets source of income was an\nallowance made to her by her brother and that as far as you knew she\nhad no property or means of her own.",
    "That is so.",
    "Her husband died a bankrupt and from what I knew of her\nas a girl and since I should be surprised if she had ever saved or\naccumulated any money.",
    "The cottage itself is rented not her own and the few sticks of\nfurniture arent anything to write home about even in these days.",
    "Some spurious cottage oak and some arty painted stuff.",
    "Whoever\nshes left them to wont gain much  if shes made a will that is to say.",
    "Mr Entwhistle shook his head.",
    "I know nothing about her will.",
    "I had not seen her for many years you\nmust understand.",
    "Then what exactly did you mean just now You had something in\nmind I think\n\nYes.",
    "Yes I did.",
    "I wished to be strictly accurate.",
    "Were you referring to the legacy you mentioned The one that her\nbrother left her Had she the power to dispose of that by will\n\nNo not in the sense you mean.",
    "She had no power to dispose of the\ncapital.",
    "Now that she is dead it will be divided amongst the five other\nbeneficiaries of Richard Abernethies will.",
    "That is what I meant.",
    "All five\nof them will benefit automatically by her death.",
    "The Inspector looked disappointed.",
    "Oh I thought we were on to something.",
    "Well there certainly seems no\nmotive there for anyone to come and swipe her with a hatchet.",
    "Looks\nas though its some chap with a screw loose  one of these adolescent\ncriminals perhaps  a lot of them about.",
    "And then he lost his nerve and\nbushed the trinkets and ran...",
    "Yes it must be that.",
    "Unless its the highly\nrespectable Miss Gilchrist and I must say that seems unlikely.",
    "When did she find the body\n\nNot until just about five oclock.",
    "She came back from Reading by the\n4.50 bus.",
    "She arrived back at the cottage let herself in by the front\ndoor and went into the kitchen and put the kettle on for tea.",
    "There was\n\n\fno sound from Mrs Lansquenets room but Miss Gilchrist assumed\nthat she was still sleeping.",
    "Then Miss Gilchrist noticed the kitchen\nwindow the glass was all over the floor.",
    "Even then she thought at first\nit might have been done by a boy with a ball or a catapult.",
    "She went\nupstairs and peeped very gently into Mrs Lansquenets room to see if\nshe were asleep or if she was ready for some tea.",
    "Then of course she\nlet loose shrieked and rushed down the lane to the nearest\nneighbour.",
    "Her story seems perfectly consistent and there was no\ntrace of blood in her room or in the bathroom or on her clothes.",
    "No I\ndont think Miss Gilchrist had anything to do with it.",
    "The doctor got\nthere at halfpast five.",
    "He puts the time of death not later than fourthirty  and probably much nearer two oclock so it looks as though\nwhoever it was was hanging round waiting for Miss Gilchrist to leave\nthe cottage.",
    "The lawyers face twitched slightly.",
    "Inspector Morton went on Youll\nbe going to see Miss Gilchrist I suppose\n\nI thought of doing so.",
    "I should be glad if you would.",
    "Shes told us I think everything that she\ncan but you never know.",
    "Sometimes in conversation some point or\nother may crop up.",
    "Shes a trifle oldmaidish  but quite a sensible\npractical woman  and shes really been most helpful and efficient.",
    "He paused and then said\n\nThe bodys at the mortuary.",
    "If you would like to see it.",
    "Mr Entwhistle assented though with no enthusiasm.",
    "Some few minutes later he stood looking down at the mortal remains of\nCora Lansquenet.",
    "She had been savagely attacked and the henna\ndyed fringe was clotted and stiffened with blood.",
    "Mr Entwhistles lips\ntightened and he looked away queasily.",
    "Poor little Cora.",
    "How eager she had been the day before yesterday to\nknow whether her brother had left her anything.",
    "What rosy\nanticipations she must have had of the future.",
    "What a lot of silly things\nshe could have done  and enjoyed doing  with the money.",
    "Poor Cora... How short a time those anticipations had lasted.",
    "No one had gained by her death  not even the brutal assailant who had\nthrust away those trinkets as he fled.",
    "Five people had a few thousands\nmore of capital  but the capital they had already received was\nprobably more than sufficient for them.",
    "No there could be no motive\nthere.",
    "Funny that murder should have been running in Coras mind the very\nday before she herself was murdered.",
    "He was murdered wasnt he\n\nSuch a ridiculous thing to say.",
    "Ridiculous Quite ridiculous Much too\nridiculous to mention to Inspector Morton.",
    "Of course after he had\nseen Miss Gilchrist...\n\nSupposing that Miss Gilchrist although it was unlikely could throw\nany light on what Richard had said to Cora.",
    "I thought from what he said  What had Richard said\n\nI must see Miss Gilchrist at once said Mr Entwhistle to himself.",
    "III\n\nMiss Gilchrist was a spare fadedlooking woman with short irongrey\nhair.",
    "She had one of those indeterminate faces that women around fifty\nso often acquire.",
    "She greeted Mr Entwhistle warmly.",
    "Im so glad you have come Mr Entwhistle.",
    "I really know so little about\nMrs Lansquenets family and of course Ive never never had anything\nto do with a murder before.",
    "Its too dreadful\n\nMr Entwhistle felt quite sure that Miss Gilchrist had never before had\nanything to do with murder.",
    "Indeed her reaction to it was very much\nthat of his partner.",
    "One reads about them of course said Miss Gilchrist relegating\ncrimes to their proper sphere.",
    "And even that Im not very fond of\ndoing.",
    "So sordid most of them.",
    "Following her into the sittingroom Mr Entwhistle was looking sharply\nabout him.",
    "There was a strong smell of oil paint.",
    "The cottage was\novercrowded less by furniture which was much as Inspector Morton\nhad described it than by pictures.",
    "The walls were covered with\npictures mostly very dark and dirty oil paintings.",
    "But there were\n\n\fwatercolour sketches as well and one or two still lifes.",
    "Smaller\npictures were stacked on the windowseat.",
    "Mrs Lansquenet used to buy them at sales Miss Gilchrist explained.",
    "It was a great interest to her poor dear.",
    "She went to all the sales\nround about.",
    "Pictures go so cheap nowadays a mere song.",
    "She never\npaid more than a pound for any of them sometimes only a few\nshillings and there was a wonderful chance she always said of\npicking up something worth while.",
    "She used to say that this was an\nItalian Primitive that might be worth a lot of money.",
    "Mr Entwhistle looked at the Italian Primitive pointed out to him\ndubiously.",
    "Cora he reflected had never really known anything about\npictures.",
    "Hed eat his hat if any of these daubs were worth a five pound\nnote\n\nOf course said Miss Gilchrist noticing his expression and quick to\nsense his reaction.",
    "I dont know much myself though my father was a\npainter  not a very successful one Im afraid.",
    "But I used to do watercolours myself as a girl and I heard a lot of talk about painting and that\nmade it nice for Mrs Lansquenet to have someone she could talk to\nabout painting and whod understand.",
    "Poor dear soul she cared so\nmuch about artistic things.",
    "You were fond of her\n\nA foolish question he told himself.",
    "Could she possibly answer no\nCora he thought must have been a tiresome woman to live with.",
    "Oh yes said Miss Gilchrist.",
    "We got on very well together.",
    "In some\nways you know Mrs Lansquenet was just like a child.",
    "She said\nanything that came into her head.",
    "I dont know that her judgment was\nalways very good \n\nOne does not say of the dead  She was a thoroughly silly woman  Mr\nEntwhistle said She was not in any sense an intellectual woman.",
    "No  no  perhaps not.",
    "But she was very shrewd Mr Entwhistle.",
    "Really\nvery shrewd.",
    "It quite surprised me sometimes  how she managed to\nhit the nail on the head.",
    "Mr Entwhistle looked at Miss Gilchrist with more interest.",
    "He thought\nthat she was no fool herself.",
    "You were with Mrs Lansquenet for some years I think\n\nThree and a half.",
    "You  er  acted as companion and also did the  er  well  looked after\nthe house\n\nIt was evident that he had touched on a delicate subject.",
    "Miss Gilchrist\nflushed a little.",
    "Oh yes indeed.",
    "I did most of the cooking  I quite enjoy cooking  and\ndid some dusting and light housework.",
    "None of the rough of course.",
    "Miss Gilchrists tone expressed a firm principle.",
    "Mr Entwhistle who had\nno idea what the rough was made a soothing murmur.",
    "Mrs Panter from the village came in for that.",
    "Twice a week regularly.",
    "You see Mr Entwhistle I could not have contemplated being in any\nway a servant.",
    "When my little teashop failed  such a disaster  it was\nthe war you know.",
    "A delightful place.",
    "I called it the Willow Tree and all\nthe china was blue willow pattern  sweetly pretty  and the cakes\nreally good  Ive always had a hand with cakes and scones.",
    "Yes I was\ndoing really well and then the war came and supplies were cut down\nand the whole thing went bankrupt  a war casualty that is what I\nalways say and I try to think of it like that.",
    "I lost the little money my\nfather left me that I had invested in it and of course I had to look round\nfor something to do.",
    "Id never been trained for anything.",
    "So I went to\none lady but it didnt answer at all  she was so rude and overbearing and then I did some office work  but I didnt like that at all and then I\ncame to Mrs Lansquenet and we suited each other from the start  her\nhusband being an artist and everything.",
    "Miss Gilchrist came to a\nbreathless stop and added mournfully But how I loved my dear dear\nlittle teashop.",
    "Such nice people used to come to it\n\nLooking at Miss Gilchrist Mr Entwhistle felt a sudden stab of\nrecognition  a composite picture of hundreds of ladylike figures\napproaching him in numerous Bay Trees Ginger Cats Blue Parrots\nWillow Trees and Cosy Corners all chastely encased in blue or pink or\norange overalls and taking orders for pots of china tea and cakes.",
    "Miss\nGilchrist had a Spiritual Home  a ladylike teashop of Ye Olde Worlde\nvariety with a suitable genteel clientele.",
    "There must he thought be\nlarge numbers of Miss Gilchrists all over the country all looking much\nalike with mild patient faces and obstinate upper lips and slightly wispy\ngrey hair.",
    "Miss Gilchrist went on\n\n\fBut really I must not talk about myself.",
    "The police have been very kind\nand considerate.",
    "Very kind indeed.",
    "An Inspector Morton came over\nfrom headquarters and he was most understanding.",
    "He even arranged\nfor me to go and spend the night at Mrs Lakes down the lane but I said\nNo.",
    "I felt it my duty to stay here with all Mrs Lansquenets nice things\nin the house.",
    "They took the  the  Miss Gilchrist gulped a little  the\nbody away of course and locked up the room and the Inspector told\nme there would be a constable on duty in the kitchen all night because of the broken window  it has been reglazed this morning I\nam glad to say  where was I Oh yes so I said I should be quite all\nright in my own room though I must confess I did pull the chest of\ndrawers across the door and put a big jug of water on the windowsill.",
    "One never knows  and if by any chance it was a maniac  one does\nhear of such things...",
    "Here Miss Gilchrist ran down.",
    "Mr Entwhistle said quickly\n\nI am in possession of all the main facts.",
    "Inspector Morton gave them\nto me.",
    "But if it would not distress you too much to give me your own\naccount\n\nOf course Mr Entwhistle.",
    "I know just what you feel.",
    "The police are so\nimpersonal are they not Rightly so of course.",
    "Mrs Lansquenet got back from the funeral the night before last Mr\nEntwhistle prompted.",
    "Yes her train didnt get in until quite late.",
    "I had ordered a taxi to meet\nit as she told me to.",
    "She was very tired poor dear  as was only natural\n but on the whole she was in quite good spirits.",
    "Yes yes.",
    "Did she talk about the funeral at all\n\nJust a little.",
    "I gave her a cup of hot milk  she didnt want anything else\n and she told me that the church had been quite full and lots and lots\nof flowers  oh and she said that she was sorry not to have seen her\nother brother  Timothy  was it\n\nYes Timothy.",
    "She said it was over twenty years since she had seen him and that\nshe hoped he would have been there but she quite realised he would\nhave thought it better not to come under the circumstances but that\nhis wife was there and that shed never been able to stand Maude  oh\ndear I do beg your pardon Mr Entwhistle  it just slipped out  I never\nmeant \n\nNot at all.",
    "Not at all said Mr Entwhistle encouragingly.",
    "I am no\nrelation you know.",
    "And I believe that Cora and her sisterinlaw never\nhit it off very well.",
    "Well she almost said as much.",
    "I always knew Maude would grow into\none of those bossy interfering women is what she said.",
    "And then she\nwas very tired and said shed go to bed at once  Id got her hotwater\nbottle in all ready  and she went up.",
    "She said nothing else that you can remember specially\n\n\fShe had no premonition Mr Entwhistle if that is what you mean.",
    "Im\nsure of that.",
    "She was really you know in remarkably good spirits apart from tiredness and the  the sad occasion.",
    "She asked me how Id\nlike to go to Capri.",
    "To Capri Of course I said it would be too wonderful\n its a thing Id never dreamed Id ever do  and she said Well go\nJust like that.",
    "I gathered  of course it wasnt actually mentioned that\nher brother had left her an annuity or something of the kind.",
    "Mr Entwhistle nodded.",
    "Poor dear.",
    "Well Im glad she had the pleasure of planning  at all\nevents.",
    "Miss Gilchrist sighed and murmured wistfully I dont\nsuppose I shall ever go to Capri now...\n\nAnd the next morning Mr Entwhistle prompted oblivious of Miss\nGilchrists disappointments.",
    "The next morning Mrs Lansquenet wasnt at all well.",
    "Really she\nlooked dreadful.",
    "Shed hardly slept at all she told me.",
    "Nightmares.",
    "Its\nbecause you were overtired yesterday I told her and she said maybe\nit was.",
    "She had her breakfast in bed and she didnt get up all the\nmorning but at lunchtime she told me that she still hadnt been able to\nsleep.",
    "I feel so restless she said.",
    "I keep thinking of things and\nwondering.",
    "And then she said shed take some sleeping tablets and\ntry and get a good sleep in the afternoon.",
    "And she wanted me to go\nover by bus to Reading and change her two library books because\nshed finished them both on the train journey and she hadnt got\nanything to read.",
    "Usually two books lasted her nearly a week.",
    "So I\nwent off just after two and that  and that  was the last time  Miss\n\n\fGilchrist began to sniff.",
    "She must have been asleep you know.",
    "she\nwouldnt have heard anything and the Inspector assures me that she\ndidnt suffer...",
    "He thinks the first blow killed her.",
    "Oh dear it makes me\nquite sick even to think of it\n\nPlease please.",
    "Ive no wish to take you any further over what\nhappened.",
    "All I wanted was to hear what you could tell me about Mrs\nLansquenet before the tragedy.",
    "Very natural Im sure.",
    "Do tell her relations that apart from having\nsuch a bad night she was really very happy and looking forward to the\nfuture.",
    "Mr Entwhistle paused before asking his next question.",
    "He wanted to be\ncareful not to lead the witness.",
    "She did not mention any of her relations in particular\n\nNo no I dont think so.",
    "Miss Gilchrist considered.",
    "Except what she\nsaid about being sorry not to see her brother Timothy.",
    "She did no speak at all about her brothers decease The  er  cause\nof it Anything like that\n\nNo.",
    "There was no sign of alertness in Miss Gilchrists face.",
    "Mr Entwhistle\nfelt certain there would have been if Cora had plumped out her verdict\nof murder.",
    "Hed been ill for some time I think said Miss Gilchrist vaguely\nthough I must say I was surprised to hear it.",
    "He looked so very\nvigorous.",
    "Mr Entwhistle said quickly\n\nYou saw him  when\n\nWhen he came down here to see Mrs Lansquenet.",
    "Let me see  that\nwas about three weeks ago.",
    "Did he stay here\n\nOh  no  just came for luncheon.",
    "It was quite a surprise.",
    "Mrs\nLansquenet hadnt expected him.",
    "I gather there had been some family\ndisagreement.",
    "She hadnt seen him for years she told me.",
    "Yes that is so.",
    "It quite upset her seeing him again and probably realising how ill he\nwas \n\nShe knew that he was ill\n\nOh yes I remember quite well.",
    "Because I wondered only in my own\nmind you understand  if perhaps Mr Abernethie might be suffering\nfrom softening of the brain.",
    "An aunt of mine \n\nMr Entwhistle deftly sidetracked the aunt.",
    "Something Mrs Lansquenet said caused you to think of softening of\nthe brain\n\nYes.",
    "Mrs Lansquenet said something like Poor Richard.",
    "Mortimers\ndeath must have aged him a lot.",
    "He sounds quite senile.",
    "All these\nfancies about persecution and that someone is poisoning him.",
    "Old\npeople get like that.",
    "And of course as I knew that is only too true.",
    "This aunt that I was telling you about  was convinced the servants\nwere trying to poison her in her food and at last would eat only boiled\neggs  because she said you couldnt get inside a boiled egg to poison\nit.",
    "We humoured her but if it had been nowadays I dont know what we\nshould have done.",
    "With eggs so scarce and mostly foreign at that so\nthat boiling is always risky.",
    "Mr Entwhistle listened to the saga of Miss Gilchrists aunt with deaf\nears.",
    "He was very much disturbed.",
    "He said at last when Miss Gilchrist had twittered into silence\n\nI suppose Mrs Lansquenet didnt take all this too seriously\n\nOh no Mr Entwhistle she quite understood.",
    "Mr Entwhistle found that remark disturbing too though not quite in the\nsense in which Miss Gilchrist had used it.",
    "Had Cora Lansquenet understood Not then perhaps but later.",
    "Had\nshe understood only too well\n\n\fMr Entwhistle knew that there had been no senility about Richard\nAbernethie.",
    "Richard had been in full possession of his faculties.",
    "He\nwas not the man to have persecution mania in any form.",
    "He was as he\nalways had been a hardheaded business man  and his illness made\nno difference in that respect.",
    "It seemed extraordinary that he should have spoken to his sister in the\nterms that he had.",
    "But perhaps Cora with her odd childlike\nshrewdness had read between the lines and had crossed the ts and\ndotted the is of what Richard Abernethie had actually said.",
    "In most ways thought Mr Entwhistle Cora had been a complete fool.",
    "She had no judgment no balance and a crude childish point of view\nbut she had also the childs uncanny knack of sometimes hitting the\nnail on the head in a way that seemed quite startling.",
    "Mr Entwhistle left it at that.",
    "Miss Gilchrist he thought knew no more\nthan she had told him.",
    "He asked whether she knew if Cora Lansquenet\nhad left a will.",
    "Miss Gilchrist replied promptly that Mrs Lansquenets\nwill was at the Bank.",
    "With that and after making certain further arrangements he took his\nleave.",
    "He insisted on Miss Gilchrists accepting a small sum in cash to\ndefray present expenses and told her he would communicate with her\nagain and in the meantime he would be grateful if she would stay on at\nthe cottage while she was looking about for a new post.",
    "That would be\nMiss Gilchrist said a great convenience and really she was not at all\nnervous.",
    "He was unable to escape without being shown round the cottage by\nMiss Gilchrist and introduced to various pictures by the late Pierre\nLansquenet which were crowded into the small diningroom and which\nmade Mr Entwhistle flinch  they were mostly nudes executed with a\nsingular lack of draughtsmanship but with much fidelity to detail.",
    "He\nwas also made to admire various small oil sketches of picturesque\nfishing ports done by Cora herself.",
    "Polperro said Miss Gilchrist proudly.",
    "We were there last year and\nMrs Lansquenet was delighted with its picturesqueness.",
    "Mr Entwhistle viewing Polperro from the southwest from the northwest and presumably from the several other points of the compass\nagreed that Mrs Lansquenet had certainly been enthusiastic.",
    "Mrs Lansquenet promised to leave me her sketches said Miss\nGilchrist wistfully.",
    "I admired them so much.",
    "One can really see the\nwaves breaking in this one cant one Even if she forgot I might\nperhaps have just one as a souvenir do you think\n\nIm sure that could be arranged said Mr Entwhistle graciously.",
    "He made a few further arrangements and then left to interview the\nBank Manager and to have a further consultation with Inspector\nMorton.",
    "Chapter 5\n\nWorn out thats what you are said Miss Entwhistle in the indignant\nand bullying tones adopted by devoted sisters towards brothers for\n\n\fwhom they keep house.",
    "You shouldnt do it at your age.",
    "Whats it all\ngot to do with you Id like to know Youve retired havent you\n\nMr Entwhistle said mildly that Richard Abernethie had been one of his\noldest friends.",
    "I dare say.",
    "But Richard Abernethies dead isnt he So I see no\nreason for you to go mixing yourself up in things that are no concern of\nyours and catching your death of cold in these nasty draughty railway\ntrains.",
    "And murder too I cant see why they sent for you at all.",
    "They communicated with me because there was a letter in the\ncottage signed by me telling Cora the arrangements for the funeral.",
    "Funerals One funeral after another and that reminds me.",
    "Another of\nthese precious Abernethies has been ringing you up  Timothy I think\nhe said.",
    "From somewhere in Yorkshire  and thats about a funeral too\nSaid hed ring again later.",
    "A personal call for Mr Entwhistle came through that evening.",
    "Taking it\nhe heard Maude Abernethies voice at the other end.",
    "Thank goodness Ive got hold of you at last Timothy has been in the\nmost terrible state.",
    "This news about Cora has upset him dreadfully.",
    "Quite understandable said Mr Entwhistle.",
    "What did you say\n\nI said it was quite understandable.",
    "I suppose so.",
    "Maude sounded more than doubtful.",
    "Do you mean to\nsay it was really murder\n\nIt was murder wasnt it Cora had said.",
    "But this time there was no\nhesitation about the answer.",
    "Yes it was murder said Mr Entwhistle.",
    "And with a hatchet so the papers say\n\nYes.",
    "It seems quite incredible to me said Maude that Timothys sister his own sister  can have been murdered with a hatchet\n\nIt seemed no less incredible to Mr Entwhistle.",
    "Timothys life was so\nremote from violence that even his relations one felt ought to be\nequally exempt.",
    "Im afraid one has to face the fact said Mr Entwhistle mildly.",
    "I am really very worried about Timothy.",
    "Its so bad for him all this Ive\ngot him to bed now but he insists on my persuading you to come up\nand see him.",
    "He wants to know a hundred things  whether there will\nbe an inquest and who ought to attend and how soon after that the\nfuneral can take place and where and what funds there are and if\nCora expressed any wish about being cremated or what and if she left\na will \n\n\fMr Entwhistle interrupted before the catalogue got too long.",
    "There is a will yes.",
    "She left Timothy her executor.",
    "Oh dear Im afraid Timothy cant undertake anything \n\nThe firm will attend to all the necessary business.",
    "The wills very\nsimple.",
    "She left her own sketches and an amethyst brooch to her\ncompanion Miss Gilchrist and everything else to Susan.",
    "To Susan Now I wonder why Susan I dont believe she ever saw\nSusan  not since she was a baby anyway.",
    "I imagine that it was because Susan was reported to have made a\nmarriage not wholly pleasing to the family.",
    "Maude snorted.",
    "Even Gregory is a great deal better than Pierre Lansquenet ever was\nOf course marrying a man who serves in a shop would have been\nunheard of in my day  but a chemists shop is much better than a\nhaberdashers  and at least Gregory seems quite respectable.",
    "She\npaused and added Does this mean that Susan gets the income\nRichard left to Cora\n\nOh no.",
    "The capital of that will be divided according to the instructions\nof Richards will.",
    "No poor Cora had only a few hundred pounds and\nthe furniture of her cottage to leave.",
    "When outstanding debts are paid\nand the furniture sold I doubt if the whole thing will amount to more\nthan at most five hundred pounds.",
    "He went on There will have to be\n\n\fan inquest of course.",
    "That is fixed for next Thursday.",
    "If Timothy is\nagreeable well send down young Lloyd to watch the proceedings on\nbehalf of the family.",
    "He added apologetically Im afraid it may attract\nsome notoriety owing to the  er  circumstances.",
    "How very unpleasant Have they caught the wretch who did it\n\nNot yet.",
    "One of these dreadful halfbaked young men who go about the\ncountry roving and murdering I suppose.",
    "The police are so\nincompetent.",
    "No no said Mr Entwhistle.",
    "The police are by no means\nincompetent.",
    "Dont imagine that for a moment.",
    "Well it all seems to me quite extraordinary.",
    "And so bad for Timothy.",
    "I\nsuppose you couldnt possibly come down here Mr Entwhistle I\nshould be most grateful if you could.",
    "I think Timothys mind might be\nset at rest if you were here to reassure him.",
    "Mr Entwhistle was silent for a moment.",
    "The invitation was not\nunwelcome.",
    "There is something in what you say he admitted.",
    "And I shall need\nTimothys signature as executor to certain documents.",
    "Yes I think it\nmight be quite a good thing.",
    "That is splendid.",
    "I am so relieved.",
    "Tomorrow And youll stay the\nnight The best train is the 11.20 from St Pancras.",
    "It will have to be an afternoon train Im afraid.",
    "I have said Mr\nEntwhistle other business in the morning...\n\nII\n\nGeorge Crossfield greeted Mr Entwhistle heartily but with perhaps\njust a shade of surprise.",
    "Mr Entwhistle said in an explanatory way although it really explained\nnothing\n\nIve just come up from Lytchett St Mary.",
    "Then it really was Aunt Cora I read about it in the papers and I just\ncouldnt believe it.",
    "I thought it must be someone of the same name.",
    "Lansquenet is not a common name.",
    "No of course it isnt.",
    "I suppose there is a natural aversion to believing\nthat anyone of ones own family can be murdered.",
    "Sounds to me rather\nlike that case last month on Dartmoor.",
    "Does it\n\nYes.",
    "Same circumstances.",
    "Cottage in a lonely position.",
    "Two elderly\nwomen living together.",
    "Amount of cash taken really quite pitifully\ninadequate one would think.",
    "The value of money is always relative said Mr Entwhistle.",
    "It is the\nneed that counts.",
    "Yes  yes I suppose you re right.",
    "If you need ten pounds desperately  then fifteen is more than\nadequate.",
    "And inversely also.",
    "If your need is for a hundred pounds\nfortyfive would be worse than useless.",
    "And if its thousands you need\nthen hundreds are not enough.",
    "George said with a sudden flicker of the eyes Id say any money came\nin useful these days.",
    "Everyones hard up.",
    "But not desperate Mr Entwhistle pointed out.",
    "Its the desperation\nthat counts.",
    "Are you thinking of something in particular\n\nOh no not at all.",
    "He paused then went on It will be a little time\nbefore the estate is settled would it be convenient for you to have an\nadvance\n\nAs a matter of fact I was going to raise the subject.",
    "However I saw\nthe Bank this morning and referred them to you and they were quite\nobliging about an overdraft.",
    "Again there came that flicker in Georges eyes and Mr Entwhistle\nfrom the depths of his experience recognised it.",
    "George he felt\ncertain had been if not desperate then in very sore straits for money.",
    "He knew at that moment what he had felt subconsciously all along\n\n\fthat in money matters he would not trust George.",
    "He wondered if old\nRichard Abernethie who also had had great experience in judging\nmen had felt that.",
    "Mr Entwhistle was almost sure that after Mortimers\ndeath Richard Abernethie had formed the intention of making George\nhis heir.",
    "George was not an Abernethie but he was the only male of\nthe younger generation.",
    "He was the natural successor to Mortimer.",
    "Richard Abernethie had sent for George had had him staying in the\nhouse for some days.",
    "It seemed probable that at the end of the visit the\nolder man had not found George satisfactory.",
    "Had he felt instinctively\nas Mr Entwhistle felt that George was not straight Georges father\nso the family had thought had been a poor choice on Lauras part.",
    "A\nstockbroker who had had other rather mysterious activities.",
    "George\ntook after his father rather than after the Abernethies.",
    "Perhaps misinterpreting the old lawyers silence George said with an\nuneasy laugh\n\nTruth is Ive not been very lucky with my investments lately.",
    "I took a\nbit of a risk and it didnt come off.",
    "More or less cleaned me out.",
    "But Ill\nbe able to recoup myself now.",
    "All one needs is a bit of capital.",
    "Ardens\nConsolidated are pretty good dont you think\n\nMr Entwhistle neither agreed nor dissented.",
    "He was wondering if by\nany chance George had been speculating with money that belonged to\nclients and not with his own If George had been in danger of criminal\nprosecution \n\nMr Entwhistle said precisely\n\n\fI tried to reach you the day after the funeral but I suppose you\nwerent in the office.",
    "Did you They never told me.",
    "As a matter of fact I thought I was\nentitled to a day off after the good news\n\nThe good news\n\nGeorge reddened.",
    "Oh look here I didnt mean Uncle Richards death.",
    "But knowing\nyouve come into money does give one a bit of a kick.",
    "One feels one\nmust celebrate.",
    "As a matter of fact I went to Hurst Park.",
    "Backed two\nwinners.",
    "It never rains but it pours If your lucks in its in Only a\nmatter of fifty quid but it all helps.",
    "Oh yes said Mr Entwhistle.",
    "It all helps.",
    "And there will now be an\nadditional sum coming to you as a result of your Aunt Coras death.",
    "George looked concerned.",
    "Poor old girl he said.",
    "It does seem rotten luck doesnt it Probably\njust when she was all set to enjoy herself.",
    "Let us hope the police will find the person responsible for her death\nsaid Mr Entwhistle.",
    "I expect theyll get him all right.",
    "Theyre good our police.",
    "They round\nup all the undesirables in the neighbourhood and go through em with\n\n\fa tooth comb  make them account for their actions at the time it\nhappened.",
    "Not so easy if a little time has elapsed said Mr Entwhistle.",
    "He gave a\nwintry little smile that indicated he was about to make a joke.",
    "I myself\nwas in Hatchards bookshop at 3.30 on the day in question.",
    "Should I\nremember that if I were questioned by the police in ten days time I\nvery much doubt it.",
    "And you George you were at Hurst Park.",
    "Would\nyou remember which day you went to the races in  say  a months\ntime\n\nOh I could fix it by the funeral  the day after.",
    "True  true.",
    "And then you backed a couple of winners.",
    "Another aid to\nmemory.",
    "One seldom forgets the name of a horse on which one has\nwon money.",
    "Which were they by the way\n\nLet me see.",
    "Gaymarck and Frogg II.",
    "Yes I shant forget them in a\nhurry.",
    "Mr Entwhistle gave his dry little cackle of laughter and took his leave.",
    "III\n\nIts lovely to see you of course said Rosamund without any marked\nenthusiasm.",
    "But its frightfully early in the morning.",
    "She yawned heavily.",
    "Its eleven oclock said Mr Entwhistle.",
    "Rosamund yawned again.",
    "She said apologetically\n\nWe had the hell of a party last night.",
    "Far too much to drink.",
    "Michaels\ngot a terrible hangover still.",
    "Michael appeared at this moment also yawning.",
    "He had a cup of black\ncoffee in his hand and was wearing a very smart dressinggown.",
    "He\nlooked haggard and attractive  and his smile had the usual charm.",
    "Rosamund was wearing a black skirt a rather dirty yellow pullover\nand nothing else as far as Mr Entwhistle could judge.",
    "The precise and fastidious lawyer did not approve at all of the young\nShanes way of living.",
    "The rather ramshackle flat on the first floor of a\nChelsea house  the bottles and glasses and cigarette ends that lay\nabout in profusion  the stale air and the general air of dust and\ndishevelment.",
    "In the midst of this discouraging setting Rosamund and Michael\nbloomed with their wonderful good looks.",
    "They were certainly a very\nhandsome couple and they seemed Mr Entwhistle thought very fond\nof each other.",
    "Rosamund was certainly adoringly fond of Michael.",
    "Darling she said.",
    "Do you think just a teeny sip of champagne Just\nto pull us together and toast the future.",
    "Oh Mr Entwhistle it really is\nthe most marvellous luck Uncle Richard leaving us all that lovely\nmoney just now \n\nMr Entwhistle noted the quick almost scowling frown that Michael\ngave but Rosamund went on serenely\n\n\fBecause theres the most wonderful chance of a play.",
    "Michaels got\nan option on it.",
    "Its a most wonderful part for him and even a small part\nfor me too.",
    "Its about one of these young criminals you know that are\nreally saints  its absolutely full of the latest modern ideas.",
    "So it would seem said Mr Entwhistle stiffly.",
    "He robs you know and he kills and hes hounded by the police and\nby society  and then in the end he does a miracle.",
    "Mr Entwhistle sat in outraged silence.",
    "Pernicious nonsense these\nyoung fools talked And wrote.",
    "Not that Michael Shane was talking much.",
    "There was still a faint scowl\non his face.",
    "Mr Entwhistle doesnt want to hear all our rhapsodies Rosamund he\nsaid.",
    "Shut up for a bit and let him tell us why hes come to see us.",
    "There are just one or two little matters to straighten out said Mr\nEntwhistle.",
    "I have just come back from Lytchett St Mary.",
    "Then it was Aunt Cora who was murdered We saw it in the paper.",
    "And I said it must be because its a very uncommon name.",
    "Poor old\nAunt Cora.",
    "I was looking at her at the funeral that day and thinking\nwhat a frump she was and that really one might as well be dead if one\nlooked like that  and now she is dead.",
    "They absolutely wouldnt\nbelieve it last night when I told them that that murder with the hatchet\n\n\fin the paper was actually my aunt They just laughed didnt they\nMichael\n\nMichael Shane did not reply and Rosamund with every appearance of\nenjoyment said\n\nTwo murders one after another.",
    "Its almost too much isnt it\n\nDont be a fool Rosamund your Uncle Richard wasnt murdered.",
    "Well Cora thought he was.",
    "Mr Entwhistle intervened to ask\n\nYou came back to London after the funeral didnt you\n\nYes we came by the same train as you did.",
    "Of course... of course.",
    "I ask because I tried to get hold of you he\nshot a quick glance at the telephone  on the following day  several\ntimes in fact and couldnt get an answer.",
    "Oh dear  Im so sorry.",
    "What were we doing that day The day before\nyesterday.",
    "We were here until about twelve werent we And then you\nwent round to try and get hold of Rosenheim and you went on to lunch\nwith Oscar and I went out to see if I could get some nylons and round\nthe shops.",
    "I was to meet Janet but we missed each other.",
    "Yes I had a\nlovely afternoon shopping  and then we dined at the Castile.",
    "We got\nback here about ten oclock I suppose.",
    "About that said Michael.",
    "He was looking thoughtfully at Mr\nEntwhistle.",
    "What did you want to get hold of us for sir\n\nOh Just some points that had arisen about Richard Abernethies\nestate  papers to sign  all that.",
    "Rosamund asked Do we get the money now or not for ages\n\nIm afraid said Mr Entwhistle that the law is prone to delays.",
    "But we can get an advance cant we Rosamund looked alarmed.",
    "Michael said we could.",
    "Actually its terribly important.",
    "Because of the\nplay.",
    "Michael said pleasantly\n\nOh theres no real hurry.",
    "Its just a question of deciding whether or\nnot to take up the option.",
    "It will be quite easy to advance you some money said Mr Entwhistle.",
    "As much as you need.",
    "Then thats all right.",
    "Rosamund gave a sigh of relief.",
    "She added as an\nafterthought Did Aunt Cora leave any money\n\nA little.",
    "She left it to your Cousin Susan.",
    "Why Susan I should like to know Is it much\n\nA few hundred pounds and some furniture.",
    "Nice furniture\n\nNo said Mr Entwhistle.",
    "Rosamund lost interest.",
    "Its all very odd isnt it she said.",
    "There\nwas Cora after the funeral suddenly coming out with He was\nmurdered and then the very next day she goes and gets herself\nmurdered I mean it is odd isnt it\n\nThere was a moments rather uncomfortable silence before Mr\nEntwhistle said quietly\n\nYes it is indeed very odd...\n\nIV\n\nMr Entwhistle studied Susan Banks as she leant forward across the\ntable talking in her animated manner.",
    "None of the loveliness of Rosamund here.",
    "But it was an attractive face\nand its attraction lay Mr Entwhistle decided in its vitality.",
    "The curves\nof the mouth were rich and full.",
    "It was a womans mouth and her body\nwas very decidedly a womans  emphatically so.",
    "Yet in many ways\nSusan reminded him of her uncle Richard Abernethie.",
    "The shape of\nher head the line of her jaw the deepset reflective eyes.",
    "She had the\nsame kind of dominant personality that Richard had had the same\ndriving energy the same foresightedness and forthright judgment.",
    "Of\nthe three members of the younger generation she alone seemed to be\nmade of the metal that had raised up the vast Abernethie fortunes.",
    "Had\n\n\fRichard recognised in this niece a kindred spirit to his own Mr\nEntwhistle thought he must have done.",
    "Richard had always had a keen\nappreciation of character.",
    "Here surely were exactly the qualities of\nwhich he was in search.",
    "And yet in his will Richard Abernethie had\nmade no distinction in her favour.",
    "Distrustful as Mr Entwhistle\nbelieved of George passing over that lovely dimwit Rosamund  could\nhe not have found in Susan what he was seeking  an heir of his own\nmettle\n\nIf not the cause must be  yes it followed logically  the husband...\n\nMr Entwhistles eyes slid gently over Susans shoulder to where\nGregory Banks stood absently whittling at a pencil.",
    "A thin pale nondescript young man with reddish sandy hair.",
    "So\novershadowed by Susans colourful personality that it was difficult to\nrealise what he himself was really like.",
    "Nothing to take hold of in the\nfellow  quite pleasant ready to be agreeable  a yes man as the\nmodern term went.",
    "And yet that did not seem to describe him\nsatisfactorily.",
    "There was something vaguely disquieting about the\nunobtrusiveness of Gregory Banks.",
    "He had been an unsuitable match yet Susan had insisted on marrying him  had overborne all opposition why What had she seen in him\n\nAnd now six months after the marriage  Shes crazy about the\nfellow Mr Entwhistle said to himself.",
    "He knew the signs.",
    "A large\nnumber of wives with matrimonial troubles had passed through the\noffice of Bollard Entwhistle Entwhistle and Bollard.",
    "Wives madly\ndevoted\n\nto\n\nunsatisfactory\n\nand\n\noften\n\nwhat\n\nappeared\n\nquite\n\nunprepossessing husbands wives contemptuous of and bored by\n\n\fapparently attractive and impeccable husbands.",
    "What any woman saw\nin some particular man was beyond the comprehension of the average\nintelligent male.",
    "It just was so.",
    "A woman who could be intelligent about\neverything else in the world could be a complete fool when it came to\nsome particular man.",
    "Susan thought Mr Entwhistle was one of those\nwomen.",
    "For her the world revolved around Greg.",
    "And that had its\ndangers in more ways than one.",
    "Susan was talking with emphasis and indignation.",
    "because it is disgraceful.",
    "You remember that woman who was\nmurdered in Yorkshire last year Nobody was ever arrested.",
    "And the\nold woman in the sweet shop who was killed with a crowbar.",
    "They\ndetained some man and then they let him go\n\nThere has to be evidence my dear said Mr Entwhistle.",
    "Susan paid no attention.",
    "And that other case  a retired nurse  that was a hatchet or an axe just like Aunt Cora.",
    "Dear me you appear to have made quite a study of these crimes\nSusan said Mr Entwhistle mildly.",
    "Naturally one remembers these things  and when someone in ones\nown family is killed  and in very much the same way  well it shows\nthat there must be a lot of these sort of people going round the\ncountryside breaking into places and attacking lonely women  and\nthat the police just dont bother\n\n\fMr Entwhistle shook his head.",
    "Dont belittle the police Susan.",
    "They are a very shrewd and patient\nbody of men  persistent too.",
    "Just because it isnt still mentioned in the\nnewspapers doesnt mean that a case is closed.",
    "Far from it.",
    "And yet there are hundreds of unsolved crimes every year.",
    "Hundreds Mr Entwhistle looked dubious.",
    "A certain number yes.",
    "But there are many occasions when the police know who has\ncommitted a crime but where the evidence is insufficient for a\nprosecution.",
    "I dont believe it said Susan.",
    "I believe if you knew definitely who\ncommitted a crime you could always get the evidence.",
    "I wonder now.",
    "Mr Entwhistle sounded thoughtful.",
    "I very much\nwonder...\n\nHave they any idea at all  in Aunt Coras case  of who it might be\n\nThat I couldnt say.",
    "Not as far as I know.",
    "But they would hardly\nconfide in me  and its early days yet  the murder took place only the\nday before yesterday remember.",
    "Its definitely got to be a certain kind of person Susan mused.",
    "A\nbrutal perhaps slightly halfwitted type  a discharged soldier or a gaol\nbird.",
    "I mean using a hatchet like that.",
    "Looking slightly quizzical Mr Entwhistle raised his eyebrows and\nmurmured\n\nLizzie Borden with an axe\n\nGave her father fifty whacks\n\nWhen she saw what she had done\n\nShe gave her mother fiftyone.",
    "Oh Susan flushed angrily Cora hadnt got any relations living with\nher  unless you mean the companion.",
    "And anyway Lizzie Borden was\nacquitted.",
    "Nobody knows for certain she killed her father and\nstepmother.",
    "The rhyme is quite definitely libellous Mr Entwhistle agreed.",
    "You mean the companion did do it Did Cora leave her anything\n\nAn amethyst brooch of no great value and some sketches of fishing\nvillages of sentimental value only.",
    "One has to have a motive for murder  unless one is halfwitted.",
    "Mr Entwhistle gave a little chuckle.",
    "As far as one can see the only person who had a motive is you my\ndear Susan.",
    "Whats that Greg moved forward suddenly.",
    "He was like a sleeper\ncoming awake.",
    "An ugly light showed in his eyes.",
    "He was suddenly no\nlonger a negligible feature in the background.",
    "Whats Sue got to do\nwith it What do you mean  saying things like that\n\nSusan said sharply\n\nShut up Greg.",
    "Mr Entwhistle doesnt mean anything \n\nJust my little joke said Mr Entwhistle apologetically.",
    "Not in the best\ntaste Im afraid.",
    "Cora left her estate such as it was to you Susan.",
    "But\nto a young lady who has just inherited several hundred thousand\npounds an estate amounting at the most to a few hundreds can\nhardly be said to represent a motive for murder.",
    "She left her money to me Susan sounded surprised.",
    "How\nextraordinary.",
    "She didnt even know me Why did she do it do you\nthink\n\nI think she had heard rumours that there had been a little difficulty  er\n over your marriage.",
    "Greg back again at sharpening his pencil\nscowled.",
    "There had been a certain amount of trouble over her own\nmarriage  and I think she experienced a fellow feeling.",
    "Susan asked with a certain amount of interest\n\nShe married an artist didnt she whom none of the family liked Was\nhe a good artist\n\nMr Entwhistle shook his head very decidedly.",
    "Are there any of his paintings in the cottage\n\nYes.",
    "Then I shall judge for myself said Susan.",
    "Mr Entwhistle smiled at the resolute tilt of Susans chin.",
    "So be it.",
    "Doubtless I am an old fogey and hopelessly oldfashioned in\nmatters of art but I really dont think you will dispute my verdict.",
    "I suppose I ought to go down there anyway And look over what\nthere is.",
    "Is there anybody there now\n\nI have arranged with Miss Gilchrist to remain there until further\nnotice.",
    "Greg said She must have a pretty good nerve  to stay in a cottage\nwhere a murders been committed.",
    "Miss Gilchrist is quite a sensible woman I should say.",
    "Besides\nadded the lawyer dryly I dont think she has anywhere else to go until\nshe gets another situation.",
    "So Aunt Coras death left her high and dry Did she  were she and\nAunt Cora  on intimate terms\n\nMr Entwhistle looked at her rather curiously wondering just exactly\nwhat was in her mind.",
    "Moderately so I imagine he said.",
    "She never treated Miss Gilchrist\nas a servant.",
    "Treated her a damned sight worse I dare say said Susan.",
    "These\nwretched so called ladies are the ones who get it taken out of them\nnowadays.",
    "Ill try and find her a decent post somewhere.",
    "It wont be\ndifficult.",
    "Anyone whos willing to do a bit of housework and cook is\nworth their weight in gold  she does cook doesnt she\n\nOh yes.",
    "I gather it is something she called er the rough that she\nobjected to.",
    "Im afraid I dont quite know what the rough is.",
    "Susan appeared to be a good deal amused.",
    "Mr Entwhistle glancing at his watch said Your aunt left Timothy her\nexecutor.",
    "Timothy said Susan with scorn.",
    "Uncle Timothy is practically a myth.",
    "Nobody ever sees him.",
    "Quite.",
    "Mr Entwhistle glanced at his watch.",
    "I am travelling up to see\nhim this afternoon.",
    "I will acquaint him with your decision to go down to\nthe cottage.",
    "It will only take me a day or two I imagine.",
    "I dont want to be long\naway from London.",
    "Ive got various schemes in hand.",
    "Im going into\nbusiness.",
    "Mr Entwhistle looked round him at the cramped sittingroom of the tiny\nflat.",
    "Greg and Susan were evidently hard up.",
    "Her father he knew had\nrun through most of his money.",
    "He had left his daughter badly off.",
    "What are your plans for the future if I may ask\n\nIve got my eye on some premises in Cardigan Street.",
    "I suppose if\nnecessary you can advance me some money I may have to pay a\ndeposit.",
    "That can be managed said Mr Entwhistle.",
    "I rang you up the day\nafter the funeral several times but could get no answer.",
    "I thought\nperhaps you might care for an advance.",
    "I wondered whether you might\nperhaps have gone out of Town.",
    "Oh no said Susan quickly.",
    "We were in all day.",
    "Both of us.",
    "We didnt\ngo out at all.",
    "Greg said gently You know Susan I think our telephone must have\nbeen out of order that day.",
    "You remember how I couldnt get through\nto Hard and Co. in the afternoon.",
    "I meant to report it but it was all right\nthe next morning.",
    "Telephones said Mr Entwhistle can be very unreliable sometimes.",
    "Susan said suddenly\n\nHow did Aunt Cora know about our marriage It was at a Registry\nOffice and we didnt tell anyone until afterwards\n\n\fI fancy Richard may have told her about it.",
    "She remade her will about\nthree weeks ago it was formerly in favour of the Theosophical\nSociety  just about the time he had been down to see her.",
    "Susan looked startled.",
    "Did Uncle Richard go down to see her Id no idea of that\n\nI hadnt any idea of it myself said Mr Entwhistle.",
    "So that was when \n\nWhen what\n\nNothing said Susan.",
    "Chapter 6\n\nVery good of you to come along said Maude gruffly as she greeted\nMr Entwhistle on the platform of Bayham Compton station.",
    "I can\nassure you that both Timothy and I much appreciate it.",
    "Of course the\ntruth is that Richards death was the worst thing possible for Timothy.",
    "Mr Entwhistle had not yet considered his friends death from this\nparticular angle.",
    "But it was he saw the only angle from which Mrs\nTimothy Abernethie was likely to regard it.",
    "As they proceeded towards the exit Maude developed the theme.",
    "To begin with it was a shock  Timothy was really very attached to\nRichard.",
    "And then unfortunately it put the idea of death into Timothys\nhead.",
    "Being such an invalid has made him rather nervous about\nhimself.",
    "He realised that he was the only one of the brothers left alive and he started saying that hed be the next to go  and that it wouldnt\nbe long now  all very morbid talk as I told him.",
    "They emerged from the station and Maude led the way to a dilapidated\ncar of almost fabulous antiquity.",
    "Sorry about our old rattletrap she said.",
    "Weve wanted a new car for\nyears but really we couldnt afford it.",
    "This has had a new engine twice\n and these old cars really stand up to a lot of hard work.",
    "I hope it will start she added.",
    "Sometimes one has to wind it.",
    "She pressed the starter several times but only a meaningless whirr\nresulted.",
    "Mr Entwhistle who had never wound a car in his life felt\nrather apprehensive but Maude herself descended inserted the\nstarting handle and with a vigorous couple of turns woke the motor to\nlife.",
    "It was fortunate Mr Entwhistle reflected that Maude was such a\npowerfully built woman.",
    "Thats that she said.",
    "The old brutes been playing me up lately.",
    "Did\nit when I was coming back after the funeral.",
    "Had to walk a couple of\nmiles to the nearest garage and they werent good for much  just a\nvillage affair.",
    "I had to put up at the local inn while they tinkered at it.",
    "Of\ncourse that upset Timothy too.",
    "I had to phone through to him and tell\nhim I couldnt be back till the next day.",
    "Fussed him terribly.",
    "One tries to\nkeep things from him as much as possible  but some things one cant\n\n\fdo anything about  Coras murder for instance.",
    "I had to send for Dr\nBarton to give him a sedative.",
    "Things like murder are too much for a\nman in Timothys state of health.",
    "I gather Cora was always a fool.",
    "Mr Entwhistle digested this remark in silence.",
    "The inference was not\nquite clear to him.",
    "I dont think Id seen Cora since our marriage said Maude.",
    "I didnt\nlike to say to Timothy at the time Your youngest sisters batty not just\nlike that.",
    "But its what I thought.",
    "There she was saying the most\nextraordinary things One didnt know whether to resent them or\nwhether to laugh.",
    "I suppose the truth is she lived in a kind of imaginary\nworld of her own  full of melodrama and fantastic ideas about other\npeople.",
    "Well poor soul shes paid for it now.",
    "She didnt have any\nprot\u00e9g\u00e9s did she\n\nProt\u00e9g\u00e9s What do you mean\n\nI just wondered.",
    "Some young cadging artist or musician  or\nsomething of that kind.",
    "Someone she might have let in that day and\nwho killed her for her loose cash.",
    "Perhaps an adolescent  theyre so\nqueer at that age sometimes  especially if theyre the neurotic arty\ntype.",
    "I mean it seems so odd to break in and murder her in the middle\nof the afternoon.",
    "If you break into a house surely youd do it at night.",
    "There would have been two women there then.",
    "Oh yes the companion.",
    "But really I cant believe that anyone would\ndeliberately wait until she was out of the way and then break in and\nattack Cora.",
    "What for He cant have expected shed have any cash or\n\n\fstuff to speak of and there must have been times when both the\nwomen were out and the house was empty.",
    "That would have been\nmuch safer.",
    "It seems so stupid to go and commit a murder unless its\nabsolutely necessary.",
    "And Coras murder you feel was unnecessary\n\nIt all seems so stupid.",
    "Should murder make sense Mr Entwhistle wondered.",
    "Academically\nthe answer was yes.",
    "But many pointless crimes were on record.",
    "It\ndepended Mr Entwhistle reflected on the mentality of the murderer.",
    "What did he really know about murderers and their mental processes\nVery little.",
    "His firm had never had a criminal practice.",
    "He was no\nstudent of criminology himself.",
    "Murderers as far as he could judge\nseemed to be of all sorts and kinds.",
    "Some had had overweening\nvanity some had had a lust for power some like Seddon had been\nmean and avaricious others like Smith and Rowse had had an\nincredible fascination for women some like Armstrong had been\npleasant fellows to meet.",
    "Edith Thompson had lived in a world of\nviolent unreality Nurse Waddington had put her elderly patients out of\nthe way with businesslike cheerfulness.",
    "Maudes voice broke into his meditations.",
    "If I could only keep the newspapers from Timothy But he will insist on\nreading them  and then of course it upsets him.",
    "You do understand\ndont you Mr Entwhistle that there can be no question of Timothys\n\n\fattending the inquest If necessary Dr Barton can write out a\ncertificate or whatever it is.",
    "You can set your mind at rest about that.",
    "Thank goodness\n\nThey turned in through the gates of Stansfield Grange and up a\nneglected drive.",
    "It had been an attractive small property once  but\nhad now a doleful and neglected appearance.",
    "Maude sighed as she\nsaid\n\nWe had to let this go to seed during the war.",
    "Both gardeners called\nup.",
    "And now weve only got one old man  and hes not much good.",
    "Wages have gone up so terribly.",
    "I must say its a blessing to realise\nthat well be able to spend a little money on the place now.",
    "Were both\nso fond of it.",
    "I was really afraid that we might have to sell it.",
    "Not that I\nsuggested anything of the kind to Timothy.",
    "It would have upset him dreadfully.",
    "They drew up before the portico of a very lovely old Georgian house\nwhich badly needed a coat of paint.",
    "No servants said Maude bitterly as she led the way in.",
    "Just a\ncouple of women who come in.",
    "We had a resident maid until a month\nago  slightly hunchbacked and terribly adenoidal and in many ways\nnot too bright but she was there which was such a comfort  and quite\ngood at plain cooking.",
    "And would you believe it she gave notice and\nwent to a fool of a woman who keeps six Pekinese dogs its a larger\nhouse than this and more work because she was so fond of little\n\n\fdoggies she said.",
    "Dogs indeed Being sick and making messes all\nthe time Ive no doubt Really these girls are mental So there we are\nand if I have to go out any afternoon Timothy is left quite alone in the\nhouse and if anything should happen how could he get help Though I\ndo leave the telephone close by his chair so that if he felt faint he could\ndial Dr Barton immediately.",
    "Maude led the way into the drawingroom where tea was laid ready by\nthe fireplace and establishing Mr Entwhistle there disappeared\npresumably to the back regions.",
    "She returned in a few minutes time\nwith a teapot and silver kettle and proceeded to minister to Mr\nEntwhistles needs.",
    "It was a good tea with homemade cake and fresh\nbuns.",
    "Mr Entwhistle murmured\n\nWhat about Timothy and Maude explained briskly that she had\ntaken Timothy his tray before she set out for the station.",
    "And now said Maude he will have had his little nap and it will be the\nbest time for him to see you.",
    "Do try and not let him excite himself too\nmuch.",
    "Mr Entwhistle assured her that he would exercise every precaution.",
    "Studying her in the flickering firelight he was seized by a feeling of\ncompassion.",
    "This big stalwart matteroffact woman so healthy so\nvigorous so full of common sense and yet so strangely almost\npitifully vulnerable in one spot.",
    "Her love for her husband was maternal\nlove Mr Entwhistle decided.",
    "Maude Abernethie had borne no child and\nshe was a woman built for motherhood.",
    "Her invalid husband had\nbecome her child to be shielded guarded watched over.",
    "And\n\n\fperhaps being the stronger character of the two she had\nunconsciously imposed on him a state of invalidism greater than might\notherwise have been the case.",
    "Poor Mrs Tim thought Mr Entwhistle to himself.",
    "II\n\nGood of you to come Entwhistle.",
    "Timothy raised himself up in his chair as he held out a hand.",
    "He was a\nbig man with a marked resemblance to his brother Richard.",
    "But what\nwas strength in Richard in Timothy was weakness.",
    "The mouth was\nirresolute the chin very slightly receding the eyes less deepset.",
    "Lines of peevish irritability showed on his forehead.",
    "His invalid status was emphasised by the rug across his knees and a\npositive pharmacopoeia of little bottles and boxes on a table at his\nright hand.",
    "I mustnt exert myself he said warningly.",
    "Doctors forbidden it.",
    "Keeps telling me not to worry Worry If hed had a murder in his family\nhed do a bit of worrying I bet Its too much for a man  first Richards\ndeath  then hearing all about his funeral and his will  what a will  and\non top of that poor little Cora killed with a hatchet.",
    "Hatchet Ugh This\ncountrys full of gangsters nowadays  thugs  left over from the war\nGoing about killing defenceless women.",
    "Nobodys got the guts to put\nthese things down  to take a strong hand.",
    "Whats the country coming\nto Id like to know Whats the damned country coming to\n\n\fMr Entwhistle was familiar with this gambit.",
    "It was a question almost\ninvariably asked sooner or later by his clients for the last twenty years\nand he had his routine for answering it.",
    "The noncommittal words he\nuttered could have been classified under the heading of soothing\nnoises.",
    "It all began with that damned Labour Government said Timothy.",
    "Sending the whole country to blazes.",

    "But look here Timothys cheeks assumed a purplish hue of\nindignation.",
    "Surely Im her next of kin Only surviving brother.",
    "Mr Entwhistle explained with some care the exact provisions of\nRichard Abernethies will reminding Timothy gently that he had had a\ncopy sent him.",
    "Dont expect me to understand all that legal jargon do you said\nTimothy ungratefully.",
    "You lawyers Matter of fact I couldnt believe it\nwhen Maude came home and told me the gist of it.",
    "Thought shed got it\nwrong.",
    "Women are never clear headed.",
    "Best woman in the world\nMaude  but women dont understand finance.",
    "I dont believe Maude\neven realises that if Richard hadnt died when he did we might have\nhad to clear out of here.",
    "Fact\n\nSurely if you had applied to Richard \n\nTimothy gave a short bark of harsh laughter.",
    "Thats not my style.",
    "Our father left us all a perfectly reasonable share\nof his money  that is if we didnt want to go into the family concern.",
    "I\ndidnt.",

    "Yes yes  but I mustnt bother you with all that.",
    "What did hurt me  and\nhurt me cruelly  were the terms of Richards will.",
    "Indeed Mr Entwhistle looked inquiring.",
    "They were not  as you\nexpected\n\nI should say they werent Naturally after Mortimers death I\nassumed that Richard would leave everything to me.",
    "Ah  did he  ever  indicate that to you\n\nHe never said so  not in so many words.",
    "Reticent sort of chap\nRichard.",
    "But he asked himself here  not long after Mortimers death.",

    "Rotten silly marriages both of those\ngirls made if you ask me.",
    "Well I ask you Entwhistle naturally I\n\n\fthought he was consulting me as the head of the family after he was\ngone and naturally I thought the control of the money would be mine.",

    "Moreover the old lawyer realised very clearly\nthat Timothy Abernethie had probably always been secretly jealous of\nhis brother Richard.",
    "They had been sufficiently alike for Timothy to\nresent his brothers strength of character and firm grasp of affairs.",
    "When Richard had died Timothy had exulted in the prospect of\nsucceeding at this late date to the power to control the destinies of\nothers.",
    "Richard Abernethie had not given him that power.",

    "Capable woman Maude.",
    "But she does too much.",

    "I hear she had a breakdown coming back from the funeral\n\nYes.",
    "Car conked out.",
    "She had the sense to telephone through about it\nin case I should be anxious but that ass of a daily woman of ours wrote\ndown the message in a way that didnt make sense.",
    "I was out getting a\nbit of fresh air  Im advised by the doctor to take what exercise I can if\nI feel like it  I got back from my walk to find scrawled on a bit of paper\nMadams sorry car gone wrong got to stay night.",
    "Naturally I thought\nshe was still at Enderby.",
    "Put a call through and found Maude had left\nthat morning.",
    "Might have had the breakdown anywhere Pretty kettle\nof fish Fool of a daily woman only left me a lumpy macaroni cheese for\nsupper.",
    "I had to go down to the kitchen and warm it up myself  and\nmake myself a cup of tea  to say nothing of stoking the boiler.",
    "I might\nhave had a heart attack  but does that class of woman care Not she\nWith any decent feelings shed have come back that evening and\nlooked after me properly.",
    "No loyalty any more in the lower classes \n\nHe brooded sadly.",
    "I dont know how much Maude told you about the funeral and the\nrelatives said Mr Entwhistle.",
    "Cora produced rather an awkward\nmoment.",
    "Said brightly that Richard had been murdered hadnt he\nPerhaps Maude told you.",
    "Timothy chuckled easily.",
    "Oh yes I heard about that.",
    "Everybody looked down their noses and\npretended to be shocked.",
    "Just the sort of thing Cora would say You\nknow how she always managed to put her foot in it when she was a\ngirl Entwhistle Said something at our wedding that upset Maude I\nremember.",
    "Maude never cared for her very much.",
    "Yes Maude rang me\nup that evening after the funeral to know if I was all right and if Mrs\nJones had come in to give me my evening meal and then she told me it\nhad all gone off very well and I said What about the will and she\ntried to hedge a bit but of course I had the truth out of her.",
    "I couldnt\nbelieve it and I said she must have made a mistake but she stuck to it.",
    "It hurt me Entwhistle  it really wounded me if you know what I mean.",
    "If you ask me it was just spite on Richards part.",
    "I know one shouldnt\nspeak ill of the dead but upon my word \n\nTimothy continued on this theme for some time.",
    "Then Maude came back into the room and said firmly\n\nI think dear Mr Entwhistle has been with you quite long enough.",
    "You\nreally must rest.",
    "If you have settled everything \n\nOh weve settled things.",
    "I leave it all to you Entwhistle.",
    "Let me know\nwhen they catch the fellow  if they ever do.",
    "Ive no faith in the police\n\n\fnowadays  the Chief Constables arent the right type.",
    "Youll see to the\n er  interment  wont you We shant be able to come Im afraid.",
    "But\norder an expensive wreath  and there must be a proper stone put up\nin due course  shell be buried locally I suppose No point in bringing\nher North and Ive no idea where Lansquenet is buried somewhere in\nFrance I believe.",
    "I dont know what one puts on a stone when its\nmurder... Cant very well say entered into rest or anything like that.",
    "One will have to choose a text  something appropriate.",
    "R.I.P.",
    "No\nthats only for Catholics.",
    "O Lord thou hast seen my wrong.",
    "Judge thou my case murmured\nMr Entwhistle.",
    "The startled glance Timothy bent on him made Mr Entwhistle smile\nfaintly.",
    "From Lamentations he said.",
    "It seems appropriate if somewhat\nmelodramatic.",
    "However it will be some time before the question of the\nMemorial stone comes up.",
    "The  er  ground has to settle you know.",
    "Now dont worry about anything.",
    "We will deal with things and keep you\nfully informed.",
    "Mr Entwhistle left for London by the breakfast train on the following\nmorning.",
    "When he got home after a little hesitation he rang up a friend of his.",
    "Chapter 7\n\nI cant tell you how much I appreciate your invitation.",
    "Mr Entwhistle pressed his hosts hand warmly.",
    "Hercule Poirot gestured hospitably to a chair by the fire.",
    "Mr Entwhistle sighed as he sat down.",
    "On one side of the room a table was laid for two.",
    "I returned from the country this morning he said.",
    "And you have a matter on which you wish to consult me\n\nYes.",
    "Its a long rambling story Im afraid.",
    "Then we will not have it until after we have dined.",
    "Georges\n\nThe efficient George materialised with some P\u00e2t\u00e9 de Foie Gras\naccompanied by hot toast in a napkin.",
    "We will have our P\u00e2t\u00e9 by the fire said Poirot.",
    "Afterwards we will\nmove to the table.",
    "It was an hour and a half later that Mr Entwhistle stretched himself\ncomfortably out in his chair and sighed a contented sigh.",
    "You certainly know how to do yourself well Poirot.",
    "Trust a\nFrenchman.",
    "I am a Belgian.",
    "But the rest of your remark applies.",
    "At my age the\nchief pleasure almost the only pleasure that still remains is the\npleasure of the table.",
    "Mercifully I have an excellent stomach.",
    "Ah murmured Mr Entwhistle.",
    "They had dined off Sole Veronique followed by Escalope de Veau\nMilanaise proceeding to Poire Flamb\u00e9e with icecream.",
    "They had drunk a Pouilly Fuisse followed by a Corton and a very good\nport now reposed at Mr Entwhistles elbow.",
    "Poirot who did not care\nfor port was sipping Cr\u00e8me de Cacao.",
    "I dont know murmured Mr Entwhistle reminiscently how you\nmanage to get hold of an escalope like that It melted in the mouth\n\nI have a friend who is a Continental butcher.",
    "For him I solve a small\ndomestic problem.",
    "He is appreciative  and ever since then he is most\nsympathetic to me in the matter of the stomach.",
    "A domestic problem.",
    "Mr Entwhistle sighed.",
    "I wish you had not\nreminded me...",
    "This is such a perfect moment...",
    "Prolong it my friend.",
    "We will have presently the demi tasse and the\nfine brandy and then when digestion is peacefully under way then\nyou shall tell why you need my advice.",
    "The clock struck the half hour after nine before Mr Entwhistle stirred in\nhis chair.",
    "The psychological moment had come.",
    "He no longer felt\nreluctant to bring forth his perplexities  he was eager to do so.",
    "I dont know he said whether Im making the most colossal fool of\nmyself.",
    "In any case I dont see that theres anything that can possibly\nbe done.",
    "But Id like to put the facts before you and Id like to know\nwhat you think.",
    "He paused for a moment or two then in his dry meticulous way he told\nhis story.",
    "His trained legal brain enabled him to put the facts clearly to\nleave nothing out and to add nothing extraneous.",
    "It was a clear\nsuccinct account and as such appreciated by the little elderly man\nwith the eggshaped head who sat listening to him.",
    "When he had finished there was a pause.",
    "Mr Entwhistle was prepared\nto answer questions but for some few moments no question came.",
    "Hercule Poirot was reviewing the evidence.",
    "He said at last\n\nIt seems very clear.",
    "You have in your mind the suspicion that your\nfriend Richard Abernethie may have been murdered That suspicion\nor assumption rests on the basis of one thing only  the words spoken\nby Cora Lansquenet at Richard Abernethies funeral.",
    "Take those away\n and there is nothing left.",
    "The fact that she herself was murdered the\nday afterwards may be the purest coincidence.",
    "It is true that Richard\nAbernethie died suddenly but he was attended by a reputable doctor\nwho knew him well and that doctor had no suspicions and gave a\ndeath certificate.",
    "Was Richard buried or cremated\n\nCremated  according to his own request.",
    "Yes that is the law.",
    "And it means that a second doctor signed the\ncertificate  but there would be no difficulty about that.",
    "So we come\nback to the essential point what Cora Lansquenet said.",
    "You were\nthere and you heard her.",
    "She said But he was murdered wasnt he\n\nYes.",
    "And the real point is  that you believe she was speaking the truth.",
    "The lawyer hesitated for a moment then he said Yes I do.",
    "Why\n\nWhy Entwhistle repeated the word slightly puzzled.",
    "But yes why Is it because already deep down you had an\nuneasiness about the manner of Richards death\n\nThe lawyer shook his head.",
    "No no not in the least.",
    "Then it is because of her  of Cora herself.",
    "You knew her well\n\nI had not seen her for  oh  over twenty years.",
    "Would you have known her if you had met her in the street\n\nMr Entwhistle reflected.",
    "I might have passed her by in the street without recognising her.",
    "She\nwas a thin slip of a girl when I saw her last and she had turned into a\n\n\fstout shabby middleaged woman.",
    "But I think that the moment I spoke\nto her face to face I should have recognised her.",
    "She wore her hair in\nthe same way a bang cut straight across the forehead and she had a\ntrick of peering up at you through her fringe like a rather shy animal\nand she had a very characteristic abrupt way of talking and a way of\nputting her head on one side and then coming out with something quite\noutrageous.",
    "She had character you see and character is always\nhighly individual.",
    "She was in fact the same Cora you had known years ago.",
    "And she\nstill said outrageous things The things the outrageous things she had\nsaid in the past  were they usually  justified\n\nThat was always the awkward thing about Cora.",
    "When truth would\nhave been better left unspoken she spoke it.",
    "And that characteristic remained unchanged.",
    "Richard Abernethie\nwas murdered  so Cora at once mentioned the fact.",
    "Mr Entwhistle stirred.",
    "You think he was murdered\n\nOh no no my friend we cannot go so fast.",
    "We agree on this  Cora\nthought he had been murdered.",
    "She was quite sure he had been\nmurdered.",
    "It was to her more a certainty than a surmise.",
    "And so we\ncome to this she must have had some reason for the belief.",
    "We agree\nby your knowledge of her that it was not just a bit of mischief making.",
    "Now tell me  when she said what she did there was at once a kind of\nchorus of protest  that is right\n\n\fQuite right.",
    "And she then became confused abashed and retreated from the\nposition  saying  as far as you can remember something like But I\nthought from what he told me \n\nThe lawyer nodded.",
    "I wish I could remember more clearly.",
    "But I am fairly sure of that.",
    "She\nused the words he told me or he said \n\nAnd the matter was then smoothed over and everyone spoke of\nsomething else.",
    "You can remember looking back no special\nexpression on anyones face Anything that remains in your memory\nas shall we say  unusual\n\nNo.",
    "And the very next day Cora is killed  and you ask yourself Can it be\ncause and effect\n\nThe lawyer stirred.",
    "I suppose that seems to you quite fantastic\n\nNot at all said Poirot.",
    "Given that the original assumption is correct\nit is logical.",
    "The perfect murder the murder of Richard Abernethie\nhas been committed all has gone off smoothly  and suddenly it\n\n\fappears that there is one person who has a knowledge of the truth\nClearly that person must be silenced as quickly as possible.",
    "Then you do think that it was murder\n\nPoirot said gravely\n\nI think mon cher exactly as you thought  that there is a case for\ninvestigation.",
    "Have you taken any steps You have spoken of these\nmatters to the police\n\nNo.",
    "Mr Entwhistle shook his head.",
    "It did not seem to me that any\ngood purpose could be achieved.",
    "My position is that I represent the\nfamily.",
    "If Richard Abernethie was murdered there seems only one\nmethod by which it could be done.",
    "By poison\n\nExactly.",
    "And the body has been cremated.",
    "There is now no evidence\navailable.",
    "But I decided that I myself must be satisfied on the point.",
    "That is why Poirot I have come to you.",
    "Who was in the house at the time of his death\n\nAn old butler who has been with him for years a cook and a\nhousemaid.",
    "It would seem perhaps as though it must necessarily be\none of them \n\nAh do not try to pull the wool upon my eyes.",
    "This Cora she knows\nRichard Abernethie was killed yet she acquiesces in the hushing up.",
    "She says I think you are all quite right.",
    "Therefore it must be one of the\nfamily who is concerned someone whom the victim himself might\nprefer not to have openly accused.",
    "Otherwise since Cora was fond of\nher brother she would not agree to let the sleeping murderer lie.",
    "You\nagree to that yes\n\nIt was the way I reasoned  yes confessed Mr Entwhistle.",
    "Though\nhow any of the family could possibly \n\nPoirot cut him short.",
    "Where poison is concerned there are all sorts of possibilities.",
    "It must\npresumably have been a narcotic of some sort if he died in his sleep\nand if there were no suspicious appearances.",
    "Possibly he was already\nhaving some narcotic administered to him.",
    "In any case said Mr Entwhistle the how hardly matters.",
    "We shall\nnever be able to prove anything.",
    "In the case of Richard Abernethie no.",
    "But the murder of Cora\nLansquenet is different.",
    "Once we know who then evidence ought to\nbe possible to get.",
    "He added with a sharp glance You have\nperhaps already done something.",
    "Very little.",
    "My purpose was mainly I think elimination.",
    "It is distasteful\nto me to think that one of the Abernethie family is a murderer.",
    "I still\ncant quite believe it.",
    "I hoped that by a few apparently idle questions I\ncould exonerate certain members of the family beyond question.",
    "Perhaps who knows all of them In which case Cora would have\nbeen wrong in her assumption and her own death could be ascribed to\n\n\fsome casual prowler who broke in.",
    "After all the issue is very simple.",
    "What were the members of the Abernethie family doing on the\nafternoon that Cora Lansquenet was killed\n\nEh bien said Poirot what were they doing\n\nGeorge Crossfield was at Hurst Park races.",
    "Rosamund Shane was out\nshopping in London.",
    "Her husband  for one must include husbands \n\nAssuredly.",
    "Her husband was fixing up a deal about an option on a play Susan\nand Gregory Banks were at home all day.",
    "Timothy Abernethie who is\nan invalid was at his home in Yorkshire and his wife was driving\nherself home from Enderby.",
    "He stopped.",
    "Hercule Poirot looked at him and nodded comprehendingly.",
    "Yes that is what they say.",
    "And is it all true\n\nI simply dont know Poirot.",
    "Some of the statements are capable of\nproof or disproof  but it would be difficult to do so without showing\nones hand pretty plainly.",
    "In fact to do so would be tantamount to an\naccusation.",
    "I will simply tell you certain conclusions of my own.",
    "George may have been at Hurst Park races but I do not think he was.",
    "He was rash enough to boast that he had backed a couple of winners.",
    "It is my experience that so many offenders against the law ruin their\nown case by saying too much.",
    "I asked him the name of the winners\n\n\fand he gave the names of two horses without any apparent hesitation.",
    "Both of them I found had been heavily tipped on the day in question\nand one had duly won.",
    "The other though an odds on favourite had\nunaccountably failed even to get a place.",
    "Interesting.",
    "Had this George any urgent need for money at the time of\nhis uncles death\n\nIt is my impression that his need was very urgent.",
    "I have no evidence\nfor saying so but I strongly suspect that he has been speculating with\nhis clients funds and that he was in danger of prosecution.",
    "It is only\nmy impression but I have some experience in these matters.",
    "Defaulting\nsolicitors I regret to say are not entirely uncommon.",
    "I can only tell you\nthat I would not have cared to entrust my own funds to George and I\nsuspect that Richard Abernethie a very shrewd judge of men was\ndissatisfied with his nephew and placed no reliance on him.",
    "His mother the lawyer continued was a goodlooking rather\nfoolish girl and she married a man of what I should call dubious\ncharacter.",
    "He sighed.",
    "The Abernethie girls were not good\nchoosers.",
    "He paused and then went on\n\nAs for Rosamund she is a lovely nitwit.",
    "I really cannot see her\nsmashing Coras head in with a hatchet Her husband Michael Shane\nis something of a dark horse  hes a man with ambition and also a man\nof overweening vanity I should say.",
    "But really I know very little about\nhim.",
    "I have no reason to suspect him of a brutal crime or of a carefully\n\n\fplanned poisoning but until I know that he really was doing what he\nsays he was doing I cannot rule him out.",
    "But you have no doubts about the wife\n\nNo  no  there is a certain rather startling callousness... ut no I really\ncannot envisage the hatchet.",
    "She is a fragile looking creature.",
    "And beautiful said Poirot with a faint cynical smile.",
    "And the other\nniece\n\nSusan She is a very different type from Rosamund  a girl of\nremarkable ability I should say.",
    "She and her husband were at home\ntogether that day.",
    "I said falsely that I had tried to get them on the\ntelephone on the afternoon in question.",
    "Greg said very quickly that the\ntelephone had been out of order all day.",
    "He had tried to get someone\nand failed.",
    "So again it is not conclusive... You cannot eliminate as you hoped to\ndo... What is the husband like\n\nI find him hard to make out.",
    "He has a somewhat unpleasing\npersonality though one cannot say exactly why he makes this\nimpression.",
    "As for Susan \n\nYes\n\nSusan reminds me of her uncle.",
    "She has the vigour the drive the\nmental capacity of Richard Abernethie.",
    "It may be my fancy that she\nlacks some of the kindliness and the warmth of my old friend.",
    "Women are never kind remarked Poirot.",
    "Though they can\nsometimes be tender.",
    "She loves her husband\n\nDevotedly I should say.",
    "But really Poirot I cant believe  I wont\nbelieve for one moment that Susan \n\nYou prefer George said Poirot.",
    "It is natural As for me I am not so\nsentimental about beautiful young ladies.",
    "Now tell me about your visit\nto the older generation\n\nMr Entwhistle described his visit to Timothy and Maude at some length.",
    "Poirot summarised the result.",
    "So Mrs Abernethie is a good mechanic.",
    "She knows all about the inside\nof a car.",
    "And Mr Abernethie is not the invalid he likes to think himself.",
    "He goes out for walks and is according to you capable of vigorous\naction.",
    "He is also a bit of an ego maniac and he resented his brothers\nsuccess and superior character.",
    "He spoke very affectionately of Cora.",
    "And ridiculed her silly remark after the funeral.",
    "What of the sixth\nbeneficiary\n\nHelen Mrs Leo I do not suspect her for a moment.",
    "In any case her\ninnocence will be easy to prove.",
    "She was at Enderby.",
    "With three\nservants in the house.",
    "Eh bien my friend said Poirot.",
    "Let us be practical.",
    "What do you\nwant me to do\n\nI want to know the truth Poirot.",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes I should feel the same in your place.",
    "And youre the man to find it out for me.",
    "I know you dont take cases\nany more but I ask you to take this one.",
    "This is a matter of business.",
    "I\nwill be responsible for your fees.",
    "Come now money is always useful.",
    "Poirot grinned.",
    "Not if it all goes in the taxes But I will admit your problem interests\nme Because it is not easy...",
    "It is all so nebulous... One thing my friend\nhad better be done by you.",
    "After that I will occupy myself of\neverything.",
    "But I think it will be best if you yourself seek out the doctor\nwho attended Mr Richard Abernethie.",
    "You know him\n\nSlightly.",
    "What is he like\n\nMiddleaged G.P.",
    "Quite competent.",
    "On very friendly terms with\nRichard.",
    "A thoroughly good fellow.",
    "Then seek him out.",
    "He will speak more freely to you than to me.",
    "Ask\nhim about Mr Abernethies illness.",
    "Find out what medicines Mr\nAbernethie was taking at the time of his death and before.",
    "Find out if\nRichard Abernethie ever said anything to his doctor about fancying\n\n\fhimself being poisoned.",
    "By the way this Miss Gilchrist is sure that he\nused the term poisoned in talking to his sister\n\nMr Entwhistle reflected.",
    "It was the word she used  but she is the type of witness who often\nchanges the actual words used because she is convinced she is\nkeeping to the sense of them.",
    "If Richard had said he was afraid\nsomeone wanted to kill him Miss Gilchrist might have assumed poison\nbecause she connected his fears with those of an aunt of hers who\nthought her food was being tampered with.",
    "I can take up the point with\nher again some time.",
    "Yes.",
    "Or I will do so.",
    "He paused and then said in a different voice\nHas it occurred to you my friend that your Miss Gilchrist may be in\nsome danger herself\n\nMr Entwhistle looked surprised.",
    "I cant say that it had.",
    "But yes.",
    "Cora voiced her suspicions on the day of the funeral.",
    "The\nquestion in the murderers mind will be did she voice them to anybody\nwhen she first heard of Richards death And the most likely person for\nher to have spoken to about them will be Miss Gilchrist.",
    "I think mon\ncher that she had better not remain alone in that cottage.",
    "I believe Susan is going down.",
    "Ah so Mrs Banks is going down\n\n\fShe wants to look through Coras things.",
    "I see...",
    "I see... Well my friend do what I have asked of you.",
    "You might\nalso prepare Mrs Abernethie  Mrs Leo Abernethie for the possibility\nthat I may arrive in the house.",
    "We will see.",
    "From now on I occupy\nmyself of everything.",
    "And Poirot twirled his moustaches with enormous energy.",
    "Chapter 8\n\nMr Entwhistle looked at Dr Larraby thoughtfully.",
    "He had had a lifetime of experience in summing people up.",
    "There had\nbeen frequent occasions on which it had been necessary to tackle a\ndifficult situation or a delicate subject.",
    "Mr Entwhistle was an adept by\nnow in the art of how exactly to make the proper approach.",
    "How would\nit be best to tackle Dr Larraby on what was certainly a very difficult\nsubject and one which the doctor might very well resent as reflecting\nupon his own professional skill\n\nFrankness Mr Entwhistle thought  or at least a modified frankness.",
    "To\nsay that suspicions had arisen because of a haphazard suggestion\nthrown out by a silly woman would be illadvised.",
    "Dr Larraby had not\nknown Cora.",
    "Mr Entwhistle cleared his throat and plunged bravely.",
    "I want to consult you on a very delicate matter he said.",
    "You may be\noffended but I sincerely hope not.",
    "You are a sensible man and you will\nrealise Im sure that a  er  preposterous suggestion is best dealt\nwith by finding a reasonable answer and not by condemning it out of\nhand.",
    "It concerns my client the late Mr Abernethie.",
    "Ill ask you my\nquestion flat out.",
    "Are you certain absolutely certain that he died what\nis termed a natural death\n\nDr Larrabys goodhumoured rubicund middleaged face turned in\nastonishment on his questioner.",
    "What on earth  Of course he did.",
    "I gave a certificate didnt I If I\nhadnt been satisfied \n\nMr Entwhistle cut in adroitly\n\nNaturally naturally.",
    "I assure you that I am not assuming anything to\nthe contrary.",
    "But I would be glad to have your positive assurance  in\nface of the  er  rumours that are flying around.",
    "Rumours What rumours\n\nOne doesnt know quite how these things start said Mr Entwhistle\nmendaciously.",
    "But my feeling is that they should be stopped authoritatively if possible.",
    "Abernethie was a sick man.",
    "He was suffering from a disease that\nwould have proved fatal within I should say at the earliest two years.",
    "It might have come much sooner.",
    "His sons death had weakened his\nwill to live and his powers of resistance.",
    "I admit that I did not expect\n\n\fhis death to come so soon or indeed so suddenly but there are\nprecedents  plenty of precedents.",
    "Any medical man who predicts\nexactly when a patient will die or exactly how long he will live is\nbound to make a fool of himself.",
    "The human factor is always\nincalculable.",
    "The weak have often unexpected powers of resistance\nthe strong sometimes succumb.",
    "I understand all that.",
    "I am not doubting your diagnosis.",
    "Mr Abernethie\nwas shall we say rather melodramatically Im afraid under sentence\nof death.",
    "All Im asking you is is it quite impossible that a man\nknowing or suspecting that he is doomed might of his own accord\nshorten that period of life Or that someone else might do it for him\n\nDr Larraby frowned.",
    "Suicide you mean Abernethie wasnt a suicidal type.",
    "I see.",
    "You can assure me medically speaking that such a suggestion\nis impossible.",
    "The doctor stirred uneasily.",
    "I wouldnt use the word impossible.",
    "After his sons death life no longer\nheld the interest for Abernethie that it had done.",
    "I certainly dont feel\nthat suicide is likely  but I cant say that its impossible.",
    "You are speaking from the psychological angle.",
    "When I said\nmedically I really meant do the circumstances of his death make such\na suggestion impossible\n\n\fNo oh no.",
    "No I cant say that.",
    "He died in his sleep as people often\ndo.",
    "There was no reason to suspect suicide no evidence of his state of\nmind.",
    "If one were to demand an autopsy every time a man who is\nseriously ill died in his sleep \n\nThe doctors face was getting redder and redder.",
    "Mr Entwhistle\nhastened to interpose.",
    "Of course.",
    "Of course.",
    "But if there had been evidence  evidence of\nwhich you yourself were not aware If for instance he had said\nsomething to someone \n\nIndicating that he was contemplating suicide Did he I must say it\nsurprises me.",
    "But if it were so  my case is purely hypothetical  could you rule out\nthe possibility\n\nDr Larraby said slowly\n\nNo  no  I could not do that.",
    "But I say again I should be very much\nsurprised.",
    "Mr Entwhistle hastened to follow up his advantage.",
    "If then we assume that his death was not natural  all this is purely\nhypothetical  what could have caused it What kind of a drug I\nmean\n\n\fSeveral.",
    "Some kind of a narcotic would be indicated.",
    "There was no\nsign of cyanosis the attitude was quite peaceful.",
    "He had sleeping draughts or pills Something of that kind.",
    "Yes.",
    "I had prescribed Slumberyl  a very safe and dependable\nhypnotic.",
    "He did not take it every night.",
    "And he only had a small bottle\nof tablets at a time.",
    "Three or even four times the prescribed dose\nwould not have caused death.",
    "In fact I remember seeing the bottle on\nhis washstand after his death still nearly full.",
    "What else had you prescribed for him\n\nVarious things  a medicine containing a small quantity of morphia to\nbe taken when he had an attack of pain.",
    "Some vitamin capsules.",
    "An\nindigestion mixture.",
    "Mr Entwhistle interrupted.",
    "Vitamin capsules I think I was once prescribed a course of those.",
    "Small round capsules of gelatine.",
    "Yes.",
    "Containing adexoline.",
    "Could anything else have been introduced into  say  one of those\ncapsules\n\nSomething lethal you mean The doctor was looking more and more\nsurprised.",
    "But surely no man would ever  look here Entwhistle what\nare you getting at My God man are you suggesting murder\n\n\fI dont quite know what Im suggesting...",
    "I just want to know what\nwould be possible.",
    "But what evidence have you for even suggesting such a thing\n\nI havent any evidence said Mr Entwhistle in a tired voice.",
    "Mr\nAbernethie is dead  and the person to whom he spoke is also dead.",
    "The whole thing is rumour  vague unsatisfactory rumour and I want\nto scotch it if I can.",
    "If you tell me that no one could possibly have\npoisoned Abernethie in any way whatsoever Ill be delighted It would\nbe a big weight off my mind I can assure you.",
    "Dr Larraby got up and walked up and down.",
    "I cant tell you what you want me to tell you he said at last.",
    "I wish I\ncould.",
    "Of course it could have been done.",
    "Anybody could have\nextracted the oil from a capsule and replaced it with  say  pure\nnicotine or half a dozen other things.",
    "Or something could have been\nput in his food or drink Isnt that more likely\n\nPossibly.",
    "But you see there were only the servants in the house when\nhe died  and I dont think it was any of them  in fact Im quite sure it\nwasnt.",
    "So Im looking for some delayed action possibility.",
    "Theres no\ndrug I suppose that you can administer and then the person dies\nweeks later\n\nA convenient idea  but untenable Im afraid said the doctor dryly.",
    "I\nknow youre a responsible person Entwhistle but who is making this\nsuggestion It seems to me wildly far fetched.",
    "Abernethie never said anything to you Never hinted that one of his\nrelations might be wanting him out of the way\n\nThe doctor looked at him curiously.",
    "No he never said anything to me.",
    "Are you sure Entwhistle that\nsomebody hasnt been  well playing up the sensational Some\nhysterical subjects can give an appearance of being quite reasonable\nand normal you know.",
    "I hope it was like that.",
    "It might well be.",
    "Let me understand.",
    "Someone claims that Abernethie told her  it was\na woman I suppose\n\nOh yes it was a woman.",
    "told her that someone was trying to kill him\n\nCornered Mr Entwhistle reluctantly told the tale of Coras remark at\nthe funeral.",
    "Dr Larrabys face lightened.",
    "My dear fellow.",
    "I shouldnt pay any attention The explanation is quite\nsimple.",
    "The womans at a certain time of life  craving for sensation\nunbalanced unreliable  might say anything.",
    "They do you know.",
    "Mr Entwhistle resented the doctors easy assumption.",
    "He himself had\nhad to deal with plenty of sensationhunting and hysterical women.",
    "You may be quite right he said rising.",
    "Unfortunately we cant\ntackle her on the subject as shes been murdered herself.",
    "Whats that  murdered Dr Larraby looked as though he had grave\nsuspicions of Mr Entwhistles own stability of mind.",
    "Youve probably read about it in the paper.",
    "Mrs Lanquenet at Lytchett\nSt Mary in Berkshire.",
    "Of course  Id no idea she was a relation of Richard Abernethies Dr\nLarraby was looking quite shaken.",
    "Feeling that he had revenged himself for the doctors professional\nsuperiority and unhappily conscious that his own suspicions had not\nbeen assuaged as a result of the visit Mr Entwhistle took his leave.",
    "II\n\nBack at Enderby Mr Entwhistle decided to talk to Lanscombe.",
    "He started by asking the old butler what his plans were.",
    "Mrs Leo has asked me to stay on here until the house is sold sir and\nIm sure I shall be very pleased to oblige her.",
    "We are all very fond of\nMrs Leo.",
    "He sighed.",
    "I feel it very much sir if you will excuse me\nmentioning it that the house has to be sold.",
    "Ive known it for so very\nmany years and seen all the young ladies and gentlemen grow up in it.",
    "I always thought that Mr Mortimer would come after his father and\nperhaps bring up a family here too.",
    "It was arranged sir that I should\ngo to the North Lodge when I got past doing my work here.",
    "A very nice\n\n\flittle place the North Lodge  and I looked forward to having it very\nspick and span.",
    "But I suppose thats all over now.",
    "Im afraid so Lanscombe.",
    "The estate will all have to be sold together.",
    "But with your legacy \n\nOh Im not complaining sir and Im very sensible of Mr Abernethies\ngenerosity.",
    "Im well provided for but its not so easy to find a little\nplace to buy nowadays and though my married niece has asked me to\nmake my home with them well it wont be quite the same thing as\nliving on the estate.",
    "I know said Mr Entwhistle.",
    "Its a hard new world for us old fellows.",
    "I\nwish Id seen more of my old friend before he went.",
    "How did he seem\nthose last few months\n\nWell he wasnt himself sir.",
    "Not since Mr Mortimers death.",
    "No it broke him up.",
    "And then he was a sick man  sick men have\nstrange fancies sometimes.",
    "I imagine Mr Abernethie suffered from that\nsort of thing in his last days.",
    "He spoke of enemies sometimes of\nsomebody wishing to do him harm  perhaps He may even have\nthought his food was being tampered with\n\nOld Lanscombe looked surprised  surprised and offended.",
    "I cannot recall anything of that kind sir.",
    "Entwhistle looked at him keenly.",
    "Youre a very loyal servant Lanscombe I know that.",
    "But such fancies\non Mr Abernethies part would be quite  er  unimportant  a natural\nsymptom in some  er  diseases.",
    "Indeed sir I can only say Mr Abernethie never said anything like that\nto me or in my hearing.",
    "Mr Entwhistle slid gently to another subject.",
    "He had some of his family down to stay with him didnt he before he\ndied.",
    "His nephew and his two nieces and their husbands\n\nYes sir that is so.",
    "Was he satisfied with those visits Or was he disappointed\n\nLanscombes eyes became remote his old back stiffened.",
    "I really could not say sir.",
    "I think you could you know said Mr Entwhistle gently.",
    "Its not your\nplace to say anything of that kind  thats what you really mean.",
    "But\nthere are times when one has to do violence to ones sense of what is\nfitting.",
    "I was one of your masters oldest friends.",
    "I cared for him very\nmuch.",
    "So did you.",
    "Thats why Im asking you for your opinion as a man\nnot as a butler.",
    "Lanscombe was silent for a moment then he said in a colourless voice\n\nIs there anything  wrong sir\n\n\fMr Entwhistle replied truthfully.",
    "I dont know he said.",
    "I hope not.",
    "I would like to make sure.",
    "Have you\nyourself felt that something was  wrong\n\nOnly since the funeral sir.",
    "And I couldnt say exactly what it is.",
    "But\nMrs Leo and Mrs Timothy too they didnt seem quite themselves that\nevening after the others had gone.",
    "You know the contents of the will\n\nYes sir.",
    "Mrs Leo thought I would like to know.",
    "It seemed to me if I\nmay permit myself to comment a very fair will.",
    "Yes it was a fair will.",
    "Equal benefits.",
    "But it is not I think the will that\nMr Abernethie originally intended to make after his son died.",
    "Will you\nanswer now the question that I asked you just now\n\nAs a matter of personal opinion \n\nYes yes that is understood.",
    "The master sir was very much disappointed after Mr George had\nbeen here.",
    "He had hoped I think that Mr George might resemble Mr\nMortimer.",
    "Mr George if I may say so did not come up to standard.",
    "Miss Lauras husband was always considered unsatisfactory and Im\nafraid Mr George took after him.",
    "Lanscombe paused and then went\non Then the young ladies came with their husbands.",
    "Miss Susan he\ntook to at once  a very spirited and handsome young lady but its my\n\n\fopinion he couldnt abide her husband.",
    "Young ladies make funny\nchoices nowadays sir.",
    "And the other couple\n\nI couldnt say much about that.",
    "A very pleasant and goodlooking\nyoung pair.",
    "I think the master enjoyed having them here  but I dont\nthink  The old man hesitated.",
    "Yes Lanscombe\n\nWell the master had never had much truck with the stage.",
    "He said to\nme one day I cant understand why anyone gets stagestruck.",
    "Its a\nfoolish kind of life.",
    "Seems to deprive people of what little sense they\nhave.",
    "I dont know what it does to your moral sense.",
    "You certainly lose\nyour sense of proportion.",
    "Of course he wasnt referring directly \n\nNo no I quite understand.",
    "Now after these visits Mr Abernethie\nhimself went away  first to his brother and afterwards to his sister\nMrs Lansquenet.",
    "That I did not know sir.",
    "I mean he mentioned to me that he was going\nto Mr Timothy and afterwards to Something St Mary.",
    "That is right.",
    "Can you remember anything he said on his return in\nregard to those visits\n\nLanscombe reflected.",
    "I really dont know  nothing direct.",
    "He was glad to be back.",
    "Travelling\nand staying in strange houses tired him very much  that I do\nremember his saying.",
    "Nothing else Nothing about either of them\n\nLanscombe frowned.",
    "The master used to  well to murmur if you get my meaning speaking to me and yet more to himself  hardly noticing I was there because he knew me so well.",
    "Knew you and trusted you yes.",
    "But my recollection is very vague as to what he said  something\nabout he couldnt think what hed done with his money  that was Mr\nTimothy I take it.",
    "And then he said something about Women can be\nfools in ninetynine different ways but be pretty shrewd in the\nhundredth.",
    "Oh yes and he said You can only say what you really\nthink to someone of your own generation.",
    "They dont think youre\nfancying things as the younger ones do.",
    "And later he said  but I dont\nknow in what connection  Its not very nice to have to set traps for\npeople but I dont see what else I can do.",
    "But I think it possible sir\nthat he may have been thinking of the second gardener  a question of\nthe peaches being taken.",
    "But Mr Entwhistle did not think that it was the second gardener who\nhad been in Richard Abernethies mind.",
    "After a few more questions he\nlet Lanscombe go and reflected on what he had learned.",
    "Nothing\nreally  nothing that is that he had not deduced before.",
    "Yet there were\n\n\fsuggestive points.",
    "It was not his sisterinlaw Maude but his sister\nCora of whom he had been thinking when he made the remark about\nwomen who were fools and yet shrewd.",
    "And it was to her he had\nconfided his fancies.",
    "And he had spoken of setting a trap.",
    "For\nwhom\n\nIII\n\nMr Entwhistle had meditated a good deal over how much he should tell\nHelen.",
    "In the end he decided to take her wholly into his confidence.",
    "First he thanked her for sorting out Richards things and for making\nvarious household arrangements.",
    "The house had been advertised for\nsale and there were one or two prospective buyers who would be\nshortly coming to look over it.",
    "Private buyers\n\nIm afraid not.",
    "The YWCA are considering it and there is a young\npeoples club and the Trustees of the Jefferson Trust are looking for a\nsuitable place to house their Collection.",
    "It seems sad that the house will not be lived in but of course it is not a\npracticable proposition nowadays.",
    "I am going to ask you if it would be possible for you to remain here\nuntil the house is sold.",
    "Or would it be a great inconvenience\n\nNo  actually it would suit me very well.",
    "I dont want to go to Cyprus\nuntil May and I much prefer being here than to being in London as I\n\n\fhad planned.",
    "I love this house you know Leo loved it and we were\nalways happy when we were here together.",
    "There is another reason why I should be grateful if you would stay on.",
    "There is a friend of mine a man called Hercule Poirot \n\nHelen said sharply\n\nHercule Poirot Then you think \n\nYou know of him\n\nYes.",
    "Some friends of mine  but I imagined that he was dead long\nago.",
    "He is very much alive.",
    "Not young of course.",
    "No he could hardly be young.",
    "She spoke mechanically.",
    "Her face was white and strained.",
    "She said\nwith an effort\n\nYou think  that Cora was right That Richard was  murdered\n\nMr Entwhistle unburdened himself.",
    "It was a pleasure to unburden\nhimself to Helen with her clear calm mind.",
    "When he had finished she said\n\n\fOne ought to feel its fantastic  but one doesnt.",
    "Maude and I that\nnight after the funeral  it was in both our minds Im sure.",
    "Saying to\nourselves what a silly woman Cora was  and yet being uneasy.",
    "And\nthen  Cora was killed  and I told myself it was just coincidence  and\nof course it may be  but oh if one can only be sure.",
    "Its all so difficult.",
    "Yes its difficult.",
    "But Poirot is a man of great originality and he has\nsomething really approaching genius.",
    "He understands perfectly what\nwe need  assurance that the whole thing is a mares nest.",
    "And suppose it isnt\n\nWhat makes you say that asked Mr Entwhistle sharply.",
    "I dont know.",
    "Ive been uneasy... Not just about what Cora said that\nday  something else.",
    "Something that I felt at the time to be wrong.",
    "Wrong In what way\n\nThats just it.",
    "I dont know.",
    "You mean it was something about one of the people in the room\n\nYes  yes  something of that kind.",
    "But I dont know who or what... Oh\nthat sounds absurd \n\nNot at all.",
    "It is interesting  very interesting.",
    "You are not a fool Helen.",
    "If you noticed something that something has significance.",
    "Yes but I cant remember what it was.",
    "The more I think \n\n\fDont think.",
    "That is the wrong way to bring anything back.",
    "Let it go.",
    "Sooner or later it will flash into your mind.",
    "And when it does  let me\nknow  at once.",
    "I will.",
    "Chapter 9\n\nMiss Gilchrist pulled her black felt hat down firmly on her head and\ntucked in a wisp of grey hair.",
    "The inquest was set for twelve oclock\nand it was not quite twentypast eleven.",
    "Her grey coat and skirt looked\nquite nice she thought and she had bought herself a black blouse.",
    "She wished she could have been all in black but that would have been\nfar beyond her means.",
    "She looked round the small neat bedroom and\nat the walls hung with representations of Brixham harbour Cockington\nForge Ansteys Cove Kyance Cove Polflexan harbour Babbacombe\nBay etc.",
    "all signed in a dashing way Cora Lansquenet.",
    "Her eyes\nrested with particular fondness on Polflexan harbour.",
    "On the chest of\ndrawers a faded photograph carefully framed represented the Willow\nTeashop.",
    "Miss Gilchrist looked at it lovingly and sighed.",
    "She was disturbed from her reverie by the sound of the door bell\nbelow.",
    "Dear me murmured Miss Gilchrist I wonder who \n\nShe went out of her room and down the rather rickety stairs.",
    "The bell\nsounded again and there was a sharp knock.",
    "For some reason Miss Gilchrist felt nervous.",
    "For a moment or two her\nsteps slowed up then she went rather unwillingly to the door adjuring\nherself not to be so silly.",
    "A young woman dressed smartly in black and carrying a small suitcase\nwas standing on the step.",
    "She noticed the alarmed look on Miss\nGilchrists face and said quickly\n\nMiss Gilchrist I am Mrs Lansquenets niece  Susan Banks.",
    "Oh dear yes of course.",
    "I didnt know.",
    "Do come in Mrs Banks.",
    "Mind\nthe hallstand  it sticks out a little.",
    "In here yes.",
    "I didnt know you were\ncoming down for the inquest.",
    "Id have had something ready  some\ncoffee or something.",
    "Susan Banks said briskly\n\nI dont want anything.",
    "Im so sorry if I startled you.",
    "Well you know you did in a way.",
    "Its very silly of me.",
    "Im not usually\nnervous.",
    "In fact I told the lawyer that I wasnt nervous and that I\nwouldnt be nervous staying on here alone and really Im not nervous.",
    "Only  perhaps its just the inquest and  and thinking of things but I\nhave been jumpy all this morning.",
    "Just about half an hour ago the bell\nrang and I could hardly bring myself to open the door  which was\nreally very stupid and so unlikely that a murderer would come back and why should he  and actually it was only a nun collecting for an\norphanage  and I was so relieved I gave her two shillings although Im\nnot a Roman Catholic and indeed have no sympathy with the Roman\n\n\fChurch and all these monks and nuns though I believe the Little Sisters\nof the Poor do really do good work.",
    "But do please sit down Mrs  Mrs \n\nBanks.",
    "Yes of course Banks.",
    "Did you come down by train\n\nNo I drove down.",
    "The lane seemed so narrow I ran the car on a little\nway and found a sort of old quarry I backed it into.",
    "This lane is very narrow but theres hardly ever any traffic along\nhere.",
    "Its rather a lonely road.",
    "Miss Gilchrist gave a little shiver as she said those last words.",
    "Susan Banks was looking round the room.",
    "Poor old Aunt Cora she said.",
    "She left what she had to me you\nknow.",
    "Yes I know.",
    "Mr Entwhistle told me.",
    "I expect youll be glad of the\nfurniture.",
    "Youre newly married I understand and furnishing is such\nan expense nowadays.",
    "Mrs Lansquenet had some very nice things.",
    "Susan did not agree.",
    "Cora had had no taste for the antique.",
    "The\ncontents varied between modernistic pieces and the arty type.",
    "I shant want any of the furniture she said.",
    "Ive got my own you\nknow.",
    "I shall put it up for auction.",
    "Unless  is there any of it you would\nlike Id be very glad...\n\n\fShe stopped a little embarrassed.",
    "But Miss Gilchrist was not at all\nembarrassed.",
    "She beamed.",
    "Now really thats very kind of you Mrs Banks  yes very kind indeed.",
    "I really do appreciate it.",
    "But actually you know I have my own things.",
    "I\nput them in store in case  some day  I should need them.",
    "There are\nsome pictures my father left too.",
    "I had a small teashop at one time\nyou know  but then the war came  it was all very unfortunate.",
    "But I\ndidnt sell up everything because I did hope to have my own little\nhome again one day so I put the best things in store with my fathers\npictures and some relics of our old home.",
    "But I would like very much if\nyou really wouldnt mind to have that little painted tea table of dear\nMrs Lansquenets.",
    "Such a pretty thing and we always had tea on it.",
    "Susan looking with a slight shudder at a small green table painted\nwith large purple clematis said quickly that she would be delighted for\nMiss Gilchrist to have it.",
    "Thank you wry much Mrs Banks.",
    "I feel a little greedy.",
    "Ive got all her\nbeautiful pictures you know and a lovely amethyst brooch but I feel\nthat perhaps I ought to give that back to you.",
    "No no indeed.",
    "Youll want to go through her things After the inquest perhaps\n\nI thought Id stay here a couple of days go through things and clear\neverything up.",
    "Sleep here you mean\n\nYes.",
    "Is there any difficulty\n\nOh no Mrs Banks of course not.",
    "Ill put fresh sheets on my bed and I\ncan doss down here on the couch quite well.",
    "But theres Aunt Coras room isnt there I can sleep in that.",
    "You  you wouldnt mind\n\nYou mean because she was murdered there Oh no I wouldnt mind.",
    "Im very tough Miss Gilchrist.",
    "Its been  I mean  its all right again\n\nMiss Gilchrist understood the question.",
    "Oh yes Mrs Banks.",
    "All the blankets sent away to the cleaners and Mrs\nPanter and I scrubbed the whole room out thoroughly.",
    "And there are\nplenty of spare blankets.",
    "But come up and see for yourself.",
    "She led the way upstairs and Susan followed her.",
    "The room where Cora Lansquenet had died was clean and fresh and\ncuriously devoid of any sinister atmosphere.",
    "Like the sittingroom it\ncontained a mixture of modern utility and elaborately painted furniture.",
    "It represented Coras cheerful tasteless personality.",
    "Over the\nmantelpiece an oil painting showed a buxom young woman about to\nenter her bath.",
    "Susan gave a slight shudder as she looked at it and Miss Gilchrist said\n\n\fThat was painted by Mrs Lansquenets husband.",
    "There are a lot of\nmore of his pictures in the diningroom downstairs.",
    "How terrible.",
    "Well I dont care very much for that style of painting myself  but Mrs\nLansquenet was very proud of her husband as an artist and thought\nthat his work was sadly unappreciated.",
    "Where are Aunt Coras own pictures\n\nIn my room.",
    "Would you like to see them\n\nMiss Gilchrist displayed her treasures proudly.",
    "Susan remarked that Aunt Cora seemed to have been fond of sea\ncoast resorts.",
    "Oh yes.",
    "You see she lived for many years with Mr Lansquenet at a\nsmall fishing village in Brittany.",
    "Fishing boats are always so\npicturesque are they not\n\nObviously Susan murmured.",
    "A whole series of picture postcards\ncould she thought have been made from Cora Lansquenets paintings\nwhich were faithful to detail and very highly coloured.",
    "They gave rise\nto the suspicion that they might actually have been painted from\npicture postcards.",
    "But when she hazarded this opinion Miss Gilchrist was indignant.",
    "Mrs\nLansquenet always painted from Nature Indeed once she had had a\ntouch of the sun from reluctance to leave a subject when the light was\njust right.",
    "Mrs Lansquenet was a real artist said Miss Gilchrist reproachfully.",
    "She glanced at her watch and Susan said quickly\n\nYes we ought to start for the inquest.",
    "Is it far Shall I get the car\n\nIt was only five minutes walk Miss Gilchrist assured her.",
    "So they set\nout together on foot.",
    "Mr Entwhistle who had come down by train met\nthem and shepherded them into the Village Hall.",
    "There seemed to be a large number of strangers present.",
    "The inquest\nwas not sensational.",
    "There was evidence of identification of the\ndeceased.",
    "Medical evidence as to the nature of the wounds that had\nkilled her.",
    "There were no signs of a struggle.",
    "Deceased was probably\nunder a narcotic at the time she was attacked and would have been\ntaken quite unawares.",
    "Death was unlikely to have occurred later than\nfourthirty.",
    "Between\n\ntwo\n\nand\n\nfourthirty\n\nwas\n\nthe\n\nnearest\n\napproximation.",
    "Miss Gilchrist testified to finding the body.",
    "A police\nconstable and Inspector Morton gave their evidence.",
    "The Coroner\nsummed up briefly.",
    "The jury made no bones about the verdict Murder\nby some person or persons unknown.",
    "It was over.",
    "They came out again into the sunlight.",
    "Half a dozen\ncameras clicked.",
    "Mr Entwhistle shepherded Susan and Miss Gilchrist\n\n\finto the Kings Arms where he had taken the precaution to arrange for\nlunch to be served in a private room behind the bar.",
    "Not a very good lunch I am afraid he said apologetically.",
    "But the lunch was not at all bad.",
    "Miss Gilchrist sniffed a little and\nmurmured that it was all so dreadful but cheered up and tackled the\nIrish stew with appetite after Mr Entwhistle had insisted on her\ndrinking a glass of sherry.",
    "He said to Susan\n\nId no idea you were coming down today Susan.",
    "We could have come\ntogether.",
    "I know I said I wouldnt.",
    "But it seemed rather mean for none of the\nfamily to be there.",
    "I rang up George but he said he was very busy and\ncouldnt possibly make it and Rosamund had an audition and Uncle\nTimothy of course is a crock.",
    "So it had to be me.",
    "Your husband didnt come with you\n\nGreg had to settle up with his tiresome shop.",
    "Seeing a startled look in Miss Gilchrists eye Susan said My husband\nworks in a chemists shop.",
    "A husband in retail trade did not quite square with Miss Gilchrists\nimpression of Susans smartness but she said valiantly Oh yes just\nlike Keats.",
    "Gregs no poet said Susan.",
    "She added\n\nWeve\n\ngot\n\ngreat\n\nplans\n\nfor\n\nthe\n\nfuture\n\n\n\na\n\ndoublebarrelled\n\nestablishment  Cosmetics and Beauty parlour and a laboratory for\nspecial preparations.",
    "That will be much nicer said Miss Gilchrist approvingly.",
    "Something\nlike Elizabeth Arden who is really a Countess so I have been told  or is\nthat Helena Rubinstein In any case she added kindly a\npharmacists is not in the least like an ordinary shop  a draper for\ninstance or a grocer.",
    "You kept a teashop you said didnt you\n\nYes indeed Miss Gilchrists face lit up.",
    "That the Willow Tree had\never been trade in the sense that a shop was trade would never\nhave occurred to her.",
    "To keep a teashop was in her mind the essence\nof gentility.",
    "She started telling Susan about the Willow Tree.",
    "Mr Entwhistle who had heard about it before let his mind drift to other\nmatters.",
    "When Susan had spoken to him twice without his answering\nhe hurriedly apologised.",
    "Forgive me my dear I was thinking as a matter of fact about your\nUncle Timothy.",
    "I am a little worried.",
    "About Uncle Timothy I shouldnt be.",
    "I dont believe really theres\nanything the matter with him.",
    "Hes just a hypochondriac.",
    "Yes  yes you may be right.",
    "I confess it was not his health that was\nworrying me.",
    "Its Mrs Timothy.",
    "Apparently shes fallen downstairs and\ntwisted her ankle.",
    "Shes laid up and your uncle is in a terrible state.",
    "Because hell have to look after her instead of the other way about\nDo him a lot of good said Susan.",
    "Yes  yes I dare say.",
    "But will your poor aunt get any looking after\nThat is really the question.",
    "With no servants in the house.",
    "Life is really hell for elderly people said Susan.",
    "They live in a kind of\nGeorgian Manor house dont they\n\nMr Entwhistle nodded.",
    "They came rather warily out of the Kings Arms but the Press seemed\nto have dispersed.",
    "A couple of reporters were lying in wait for Susan by the cottage door.",
    "Shepherded by Mr Entwhistle she said a few necessary and noncommittal words.",
    "Then she and Miss Gilchrist went into the cottage\nand Mr Entwhistle returned to the Kings Arms where he had booked a\nroom.",
    "The funeral was to be on the following day.",
    "My cars still in the quarry said Susan.",
    "Id forgotten about it.",
    "Ill\ndrive it along to the village later.",
    "Miss Gilchrist said anxiously\n\nNot too late.",
    "You wont go out after dark will you\n\n\fSusan looked at her and laughed.",
    "You dont think theres a murderer still hanging about do you\n\nNo  no I suppose not.",
    "Miss Gilchrist looked embarrassed.",
    "But its exactly what she does think thought Susan.",
    "How amazing\n\nMiss Gilchrist had vanished towards the kitchen.",
    "Im sure youd like tea early.",
    "In about half an hour do you think Mrs\nBanks\n\nSusan thought that tea at halfpast three was overdoing it but she was\ncharitable enough to realise that a nice cup of tea was Miss\nGilchrists idea of restoration for the nerves and she had her own\nreasons for wishing to please Miss Gilchrist so she said\n\nWhenever yon like Miss Gilchrist.",
    "A happy clatter of kitchen implements began and Susan went into the\nsittingroom.",
    "She had only been there a few minutes when the bell\nsounded and was succeeded by a very precise little rattattat.",
    "Susan came out into the hall and Miss Gilchrist appeared at the\nkitchen door wearing an apron and wiping floury hands on it.",
    "Oh dear who do you think that can be\n\n\fMore reporters I expect said Susan.",
    "Oh dear how annoying for you Mrs Banks.",
    "Oh well never mind Ill attend to it.",
    "I was just going to make a few scones for tea.",
    "Susan went towards the front door and Miss Gilchrist hovered\nuncertainly.",
    "Susan wondered whether she thought a man with a\nhatchet was waiting outside.",
    "The visitor however proved to be an elderly gentleman who raised his\nhat when Susan opened the door and said beaming at her in\navuncular style.",
    "Mrs Banks I think\n\nYes.",
    "My name is Guthrie  Alexander Guthrie.",
    "I was a friend  a very old\nfriend of Mrs Lansquenets.",
    "You I think are her niece formerly Miss\nSusan Abernethie\n\nThats quite right.",
    "Then since we know who we are I may come in\n\nOf course.",
    "Mr Guthrie wiped his feet carefully on the mat stepped inside\ndivested himself of his overcoat laid it down with his hat on a small\noak chest and followed Susan into the sittingroom\n\nThis is a melancholy occasion said Mr Guthrie to whom melancholy\ndid not seem to come naturally his own inclination being to beam.",
    "Yes a very melancholy occasion.",
    "I was in this part of the world and I\nfelt the least I could do was to attend the inquest  and of course the\nfuneral.",
    "Poor Cora  poor foolish Cora.",
    "I have known her my dear Mrs\nBanks since the early days of her marriage.",
    "A highspirited girl  and\nshe took art very seriously  took Pierre Lansquenet seriously too  as\nan artist I mean.",
    "All things considered he didnt make her too bad a\nhusband.",
    "He strayed if you know what I mean yes he strayed  but\nfortunately Cora took it as part of the artistic temperament.",
    "He was an\nartist and therefore immoral In fact Im not sure she didnt go further\nhe was immoral and therefore he must be an artist No kind of sense in\nartistic matters poor Cora  though in other ways mind you Cora had\na lot of sense  yes a surprising lot of sense.",
    "Thats what everybody seems to say said Susan.",
    "I didnt really\nknow her.",
    "No no cut herself off from her family because they didnt appreciate\nher precious Pierre.",
    "She was never a pretty girl  but she had\nsomething.",
    "She was good company You never knew what shed say\nnext and you ever knew if her naivet\u00e9 was genuine or whether she was\ndoing it deliberately.",
    "She made us all laugh a good deal.",
    "The eternal\nchild  thats what we always felt about her.",
    "And really the last time I\nsaw her I have seen her from time to time since Pierre died she\nstruck me as still behaving very much like a child.",
    "Susan offered Mr Guthrie a cigarette but the old gentleman shook his\nhead.",
    "No thank you my dear.",
    "I dont smoke.",
    "You must wonder why Ive\ncome To tell you the truth I was feeling rather consciencestricken.",
    "I\npromised Cora to come and see her some weeks ago.",
    "I usually called\nupon her once a year and just lately shed taken up the hobby of\nbuying pictures at local sales and wanted me to look at some of them.",
    "My profession is that of art critic you know.",
    "Of course most of Coras\npurchases were horrible daubs but take it all in all it isnt such a bad\nspeculation.",
    "Pictures go for next to nothing at these country sales and\nthe frames alone are worth more than you pay for the picture.",
    "Naturally any important sale is attended by dealers and one isnt likely\nto get hold of masterpieces.",
    "But only the other day a small Cuyp was\nknocked down for a few pounds at a farmhouse sale.",
    "The history of it\nwas quite interesting.",
    "It had been given to an old nurse by the family\nshe had served faithfully for many years  they had no idea of its value.",
    "Old nurse gave it to farmer nephew who liked the horse in it but\nthought it was a dirty old thing Yes yes these things sometimes\nhappen and Cora was convinced that she had an eye for pictures.",
    "She\nhadnt of course.",
    "Wanted me to come and look at a Rembrandt she\nhad picked the last year.",
    "A Rembrandt Not even a respectable copy of\none But she had got hold of a quite nice Bartolozzi engraving  damp\nspotted unfortunately.",
    "I sold it for her for thirty pounds and of course\nthat spurred her on.",
    "She wrote to me with great gusto about an Italian\nPrimitive she had bought at some sale and I promised Id come along\nand see it.",
    "Thats it over there I expect said Susan gesturing to the wall\nbehind him.",
    "Mr Guthrie got up put on a pair of spectacles and went over to study\nthe picture.",
    "Poor dear Cora he said at last.",
    "There are a lot more said Susan.",
    "Mr Guthrie proceeded to a leisurely inspection of the art treasures\nacquired by the hopeful Mrs Lansquenet.",
    "Occasionally he said Tchk\nTchk occasionally he sighed.",
    "Finally he removed his spectacles.",
    "Dirt he said is a wonderful thing Mrs Banks It gives a patina of\nromance to the most horrible examples of the painters art.",
    "Im afraid\nthat Bartolozzi was beginners luck.",
    "Poor Cora.",
    "Still it gave her an\ninterest in life.",
    "I am really thankful that I did not have to disillusion her.",
    "There are some pictures in the diningroom said Susan but I think\nthey are all her husbands work.",
    "Mr Guthrie shuddered slightly and held up a protesting hand.",
    "Do not force me to look at those again.",
    "Life classes have much to\nanswer for I always tried to spare Coras feelings.",
    "A devoted wife  a\nvery devoted wife.",
    "Well dear Mrs Banks I must not take up more of\nyour time.",
    "Oh do stay and have some tea.",
    "I think its nearly ready.",
    "That is very kind of you.",
    "Mr Guthrie sat down again promptly.",
    "Ill just go and see.",
    "In the kitchen Miss Gilchrist was just lifting a last batch of scones from\nthe oven.",
    "The teatray stood ready and the kettle was just gently\nrattling its lid.",
    "Theres a Mr Guthrie here and Ive asked him to stay for tea.",
    "Mr Guthrie Oh yes he was a great friend of dear Mrs Lansquenets.",
    "Hes the celebrated art critic.",
    "How fortunate Ive made a nice lot of\nscones and thats some homemade strawberry jam and I just\nwhipped up some little drop cakes.",
    "Ill just make the tea  Ive warmed\nthe pot.",
    "Oh please Mrs Banks dont carry that heavy tray.",
    "I can\nmanage everything.",
    "However Susan took in the tray and Miss Gilchrist followed with\nteapot and kettle greeted Mr Guthrie and they set to.",
    "Hot scones that is a treat said Mr Guthrie and what delicious jam\nReally the stuff one buys nowadays.",
    "Miss Gilchrist was flushed and delighted.",
    "The little cakes were\nexcellent and so were the scones and everyone did justice to them.",
    "The ghost of the Willow Tree hung over the party.",
    "Here it was clear\nMiss Gilchrist was in her element.",
    "Well thank you perhaps I will said Mr Guthrie as he accepted the\nlast cake pressed upon him by Miss Gilchrist.",
    "I do feel rather guilty\nthough  enjoying my tea here where poor Cora was so brutally\nmurdered.",
    "Miss Gilchrist displayed an unexpected Victorian reaction to this.",
    "Oh but Mrs Lansquenet would have wished you to take a good tea.",
    "Youve got to keep your strength up.",
    "Yes yes perhaps you are right.",
    "The fact is you know that one\ncannot really bring oneself to believe that someone you knew  actually\nknew  can have been murdered\n\nI agree said Susan.",
    "It just seems  fantastic.",
    "And certainly not by some casual tramp who broke in and attacked\nher.",
    "I can imagine you know reasons why Cora might have been\nmurdered.",
    "Susan said quickly Can you What reasons\n\nWell she wasnt discreet said Mr Guthrie.",
    "Cora was never discreet.",
    "And she enjoyed  how shaw I put it  showing how sharp she could be\nLike a child whos got hold of somebodys secret.",
    "If Cora got hold of a\nsecret shed want to talk about it.",
    "Even if she promised not to shed\nstill do it.",
    "She wouldnt be able to help herself.",
    "Susan did not speak.",
    "Miss Gilchrist did not either.",
    "She looked worried.",
    "Mr Guthrie went on\n\nYes a little dose of arsenic in a cup of tea  that would not have\nsurprised me or a box of chocolates by post.",
    "But sordid robbery and\nassault  that seems highly incongruous.",
    "I may be wrong but I should\nhave thought she had very little to take that would be worth a burglars\nwhile.",
    "She didnt keep much money in the house did she\n\nMiss Gilchrist said Very little.",
    "Mr Guthrie sighed and rose to his feet.",
    "Ah well theres a lot of lawlessness about since the war.",
    "Times have\nchanged.",
    "Thanking them for the tea he took a polite farewell of the two women.",
    "Miss Gilchrist saw him out and helped him on with his overcoat.",
    "From\nthe window of the sittingroom Susan watched him trot briskly down\nthe front path to the gate.",
    "Miss Gilchrist came back into the room with a small parcel in her hand.",
    "The postman must have been while we were at the inquest.",
    "He\npushed it through the letterbox and it had fallen in the corner behind\nthe door.",
    "Now I wonder  why of course it must be wedding cake.",
    "Happily Miss Gilchrist ripped off the paper.",
    "Inside was a small white\nbox tied with silver ribbon.",
    "It is She pulled off the ribbon inside was a modest wedge of rich\ncake with almond paste and white icing.",
    "How nice Now who  She\nconsulted the card attached.",
    "John and Mary.",
    "Now who can that be\nHow silly to put no surname.",
    "Susan rousing herself from contemplation said vaguely\n\nIts quite difficult sometimes with people just using Christian names.",
    "I\ngot a postcard the other day signed Joan.",
    "I counted up I knew eight\nJoans  and with telephoning so much one often doesnt know their\nhandwriting.",
    "Miss Gilchrist was happily going over the possible Johns or Marys of\nher acquaintance.",
    "It might be Dorothys daughter  her name was Mary but I hadnt\nheard of an engagement still less of a marriage.",
    "Then theres little\nJohn Banfield  I suppose hes grown up and old enough to be married or the Enfield girl  no her name was Margaret.",
    "No address or\nanything.",
    "Oh well I dare say it will come to me...\n\nShe picked up the tray and went out to the kitchen.",
    "Susan roused herself and said\n\nWell  I suppose Id better go and put the car somewhere.",
    "Chapter 10\n\n\fSusan retrieved the car from the quarry where she had left it and\ndrove it into the village.",
    "There was a petrol pump but no garage and\nshe was advised to take it to the Kings Arms.",
    "They had room for it\nthere and she left it by a big Daimler which was preparing to go out.",
    "It\nwas chauffeur driven and inside it very much muffled up was an\nelderly foreign gentleman with a large moustache.",
    "The boy to whom Susan was talking about the car was staring at her\nwith such rapt attention the he did not seem to be taking in half of what\nshe said.",
    "Finally he said in an awestricken voice\n\nYoure her niece arent you\n\nWhat\n\nYoure the victims niece the boy repeated with relish.",
    "Oh  yes  yes I am.",
    "Ar Wondered where Id seen you before.",
    "Ghoul thought Susan as she retraced her steps to the cottage.",
    "Miss Gilchrist greeted her with\n\nOh youre safely back in tones of relief which further annoyed her.",
    "Miss Gilchrist added anxiously\n\n\fYou can eat spaghetti cant you I thought for tonight \n\nOh yes anything.",
    "I dont want much.",
    "I really flatter myself that I can make a very tasty spaghetti au gratin.",
    "The boast was not an idle one.",
    "Miss Gilchrist Susan reflected was\nreally an excellent cook.",
    "Susan offered to help wash up but Miss\nGilchrist though clearly gratified by the offer assured Susan that\nthere was very little to do.",
    "She came in a little while later with coffee.",
    "The coffee was less\nexcellent being decidedly weak.",
    "Miss Gilchrist offered Susan a piece\nof the wedding cake which Susan refused.",
    "Its really very good cake Miss Gilchrist insisted tasting it.",
    "She had\nsettled to her own satisfaction that it must have been sent by someone\nwhom she alluded to as dear Ellens daughter who I know was\nengaged to be married but I cant remember her name.",
    "Susan let Miss Gilchrist chirrup away into silence before starting her\nown subject of conversation.",
    "This moment after supper sitting before\nthe fire was a companionable one.",
    "She said at last\n\nMy Uncle Richard came down here before he died didnt he\n\nYes he did.",
    "When was that exactly\n\nLet me see  it must have been one two  nearly three weeks before\nhis death was announced.",
    "Did he seem  ill\n\nWell no I wouldnt say he seemed exactly ill.",
    "He had a very hearty\nvigorous manner.",
    "Mrs Lansquenet was very surprised to see him.",
    "She\nsaid Well really Richard after all these years And he said I came\nto see for myself exactly how things are with you.",
    "And Mrs Lansquenet\nsaid Im all right.",
    "I think you know she was a teeny bit offended by\nhis turning up so casually  after the long break.",
    "Anyway Mr Abernethie\nsaid No use keeping up old grievances.",
    "You and I and Timothy are the\nonly ones left  and nobody can talk to Timothy except about his own\nhealth.",
    "And he said Pierre seems to have made you happy so it\nseems I was in the wrong.",
    "There will that content you Very nicely he\nsaid it.",
    "A handsome man though elderly of course.",
    "How long was he here\n\nHe stayed for lunch.",
    "Beef olives I made.",
    "Fortunately it was the day\nthe butcher called.",
    "Miss Gilchrists memory seemed to be almost wholly culinary.",
    "They seemed to be getting on well together\n\nOh yes.",
    "Susan paused and then said\n\nWas Aunt Cora surprised when  he died\n\nOh yes it was quite sudden wasnt it\n\nYes it was sudden...",
    "I meant  she was surprised.",
    "He hadnt given her\nany indication how ill he was.",
    "Oh  I see what you mean.",
    "Miss Gilchrist paused a moment.",
    "No no I\nthink perhaps you are right.",
    "She did say that he had got very old  I\nthink she said senile...",
    "But you didnt think he was senile\n\nWell not to look at.",
    "But I didnt talk to him much naturally I left them\nalone together.",
    "Susan looked at Miss Gilchrist speculatively.",
    "Was Miss Gilchrist the\nkind of woman who listened at doors She was honest Susan felt sure\nshe wouldnt ever pilfer or cheat over the housekeeping or open\nletters.",
    "But inquisitiveness can drape itself in a mantle of rectitude.",
    "Miss Gilchrist might have found it necessary to garden near an open\nwindow or to dust the hall... That would be within the permitted\nlengths.",
    "And then of course she could not have helped hearing\nsomething...\n\nYou didnt hear any of their conversation Susan asked.",
    "Too abrupt.",
    "Miss Gilchrist flushed angrily.",
    "No indeed Mrs Banks.",
    "It has never been my custom to listen at\ndoors\n\nThat means she does thought Susan otherwise shed just say No.",
    "Aloud she said Im so sorry Miss Gilchrist.",
    "I didnt mean it that way.",
    "But sometimes in these small flimsily built cottages one simply cant\nhelp hearing nearly everything that goes on and now that they are\nboth dead its really rather important to the family to know just what\nwas said at that meeting between them.",
    "The cottage was anything but flimsily built  it dated from a sturdier era\nof building but Miss Gilchrist accepted the bait and rose to the\nsuggestion held out.",
    "Of course what you say is quite true Mrs Banks  this is a very small\nplace and I do appreciate that you would want to know what passed\nbetween them but really Im afraid I cant help very much.",
    "I think they\nwere talking about Mr Abernethies health  and certain  well fancies\nhe had.",
    "He didnt look it but he must have been a sick man and as is so\noften the case he put his illhealth down to outside agencies.",
    "A\ncommon symptom I believe.",
    "My aunt \n\nMiss Gilchrist described her aunt.",
    "Susan like Mr Entwhistle sidetracked the aunt.",
    "Yes she said.",
    "That is just what we thought.",
    "My uncles servants\nwere all very attached to him and naturally they are upset by his\nthinking  She paused.",
    "Oh of course Servants are very touchy about anything of that kind.",
    "I\nremember that my aunt \n\nAgain Susan interrupted.",
    "It was the servants he suspected I suppose Of poisoning him I\nmean\n\nI dont know...",
    "I  really \n\nSusan noted her confusion.",
    "It wasnt the servants.",
    "Was it one particular person\n\nI dont know Mrs Banks.",
    "Really I dont know \n\nBut her eye avoided Susans.",
    "Susan thought to herself that Miss\nGilchrist knew more than she was willing to admit.",
    "It was possible that Miss Gilchrist knew a good deal...",
    "Deciding not to press the point for the moment Susan said\n\nWhat are your own plans for the future Miss Gilchrist\n\n\fWell really I was going to speak to you about that Mrs Banks.",
    "I told\nMr Entwhistle I would be willing to stay on until everything here was\ncleared up.",
    "I know.",
    "Im very grateful.",
    "And I wanted to ask you how long that was likely to be because of\ncourse I must start looking about for another post.",
    "Susan considered.",
    "Theres really not very much to be done here.",
    "In a couple of days I can\nget things sorted and notifiy the auctioneer.",
    "You have decided to sell up everything then\n\nYes.",
    "I dont suppose there will be any difficulty in letting the cottage\n\nOh no  people will queue up for it Im sure.",
    "There are so few\ncottages to rent.",
    "One nearly always has to buy.",
    "So its all very simple you see.",
    "Susan hesitated a moment before\nsaying I wanted to tell you  that I hope youll accept three months\nsalary.",
    "Thats very generous of you Im sure Mrs Banks.",
    "I do appreciate it.",
    "And you would be prepared to  I mean I could ask you  if necessary to  to recommend me To say that I had been with a relation of yours\nand that I had  proved satisfactory\n\n\fOh of course.",
    "I dont know whether I ought to ask it.",
    "Miss Gilchrists hands began\nto shake and she tried to steady her voice.",
    "But would it be possible\nnot to  to mention the circumstances  or even the name\n\nSusan stared.",
    "I dont understand.",
    "Thats because you havent thought Mrs Banks.",
    "Its murder.",
    "A murder\nthats been in the papers and that everybody has read about.",
    "Dont you\nsee People might think.",
    "Two women living together and one of them\nis killed  and perhaps the companion did it.",
    "Dont you see Mrs Banks\nIm sure that if I was looking for someone Id  well Id think twice\nbefore engaging myself  if you understand what I mean.",
    "Because one\nnever knows Its been worrying me dreadfully Mrs Banks Ive been\nlying awake at night thinking that perhaps Ill never get another job not of this kind.",
    "And what else is there that I can do\n\nThe question came out with unconscious pathos.",
    "Susan felt suddenly\nstricken.",
    "She realised the desperation of this pleasantspoken\ncommonplace woman who was dependent for existence on the fears\nand whims of employers.",
    "And there was a lot of truth in what Miss\nGilchrist had said.",
    "You wouldnt if you could help it engage a woman\nto share domestic intimacy who had figured however innocently in a\nmurder case.",
    "Susan said But if they find the man who did it \n\n\fOh then of course it will be quite all right.",
    "But will they find him I\ndont think myself the police have the least idea.",
    "And if hes not\ncaught  well that leaves me as  as not quite the most likely person\nbut as a person who could have done it.",
    "Susan nodded thoughtfully.",
    "It was true that Miss Gilchrist did not\nbenefit from Cora Lansquenets death but who was to know that And\nbesides there were so many tales  ugly tales  of animosity arising\nbetween women who lived together  strange pathological motives for\nsudden violence.",
    "Someone who had not known them might imagine\nthat Cora Lansquenet and Miss Gilchrist had lived on those terms...\n\nSusan spoke with her usual decision.",
    "Dont worry Miss Gilchrist she said speaking briskly and\ncheerfully.",
    "Im sure I can find you a post amongst my friends.",
    "There\nwont be the least difficulty.",
    "Im afraid said Miss Gilchrist regaining some of her customary\nmanner that I couldnt undertake any really rough work.",
    "Just a little\nplain cooking and housework \n\nThe telephone rang and Miss Gilchrist jumped.",
    "Dear me I wonder who that can be.",
    "I expect its my husband said Susan jumping up.",
    "He said hed ring\nme tonight.",
    "She went to the telephone.",
    "Yes  yes this is Mrs Banks speaking personally...",
    "There was a pause and then her voice changed.",
    "It became soft and\nwarm.",
    "Hallo darling  yes its me... Oh quite well...",
    "Murder by\nsomeone unknown... the usual thing... Only Mr Entwhistle... What...\nits difficult to say but I think so...",
    "Yes just as we thought...",
    "Absolutely\naccording to plan...",

    "I know what Im\ndoing... Greg you didnt... You were careful to... No its nothing.",
    "Nothing at all.",
    "Good night darling.",
    "She rang off.",
    "The nearness of Miss Gilchrist had hampered her a little.",
    "Miss Gilchrist could probably hear from the kitchen where she had\ntactfully retired exactly what went on.",
    "There were things she had\nwanted to ask Greg but she hadnt liked to.",
    "She stood by the telephone frowning abstractedly.",
    "Then suddenly an\nidea came to her.",
    "Of course she murmured.",
    "Just the thing.",
    "Lifting the receiver she asked for Trunk Enquiry.",
    "Some quarter of an hour later a weary voice from the exchange was\nsaying\n\nIm afraid theres no reply.",
    "Please go on ringing them.",
    "Susan spoke autocratically.",
    "She listened to the far off buzzing of a\ntelephone bell.",
    "Then suddenly it was interrupted and a mans voice\npeevish and slightly indignant said\n\nYes yes what is it\n\nUncle Timothy\n\nWhats that I cant hear you.",
    "Uncle Timothy Im Susan Banks.",
    "Susan who\n\nBanks.",
    "Formerly Abernethie.",

    "Would you like Miss Gilchrist\n\nWhos she Never heard of her.",
    "Aunt Coras companion.",
    "Shes very nice and capable.",
    "Can she cook\n\nYes she cooks very well and she could look after Aunt Maude.",
    "Thats all very well but when could she come Here I am all on my\nown with only these idiots of village women popping in and out at odd\nhours and its not good for me.",
    "My hearts playing me up.",
    "Ill arrange for her to get off to you as soon as possible.",
    "The day after\ntomorrow perhaps\n\nWell thanks very much said the voice rather grudgingly.",
    "Youre a\ngood girl Susan  er  thank you.",
    "Susan rang off and went into the kitchen.",
    "Would you be willing to go up to Yorkshire and look after my aunt\nShe fell and broke her ankle and my uncle is quite useless.",
    "Hes a bit of\n\n\fa pest but Aunt Maude is a very good sort.",
    "They have help in from the\nvillage but you could cook and look after Aunt Maude.",
    "Miss Gilchrist dropped the coffee pot in her agitation.",
    "Oh thank you thank you  that really is kind.",
    "I think I can say of myself\nthat I am really good in the sickroom and Im sure I can manage your\nuncle and cook him nice little meals.",
    "Its really very kind of you Mrs\nBanks and I do appreciate it.",
    "Chapter 11\n\nSusan lay in bed and waited for sleep to come.",
    "It had been a long day\nand she was tired.",
    "She had been quite sure that she would go to sleep\nat once.",
    "She never had any difficulty in going to sleep.",
    "And yet here\nshe lay hour after hour wide awake her mind racing.",
    "She had said she did not mind sleeping in this room in this bed.",
    "This\nbed where Cora Abernethie \n\nNo no she must put all that out of her mind.",
    "She had always prided\nherself on having no nerves.",
    "Why think of that afternoon less than a\nweek ago Think ahead the future.",
    "Her future and Gregs.",
    "Those\npremises in Cardigan Street  just what they wanted.",
    "The business on\nthe ground floor and a charming flat upstairs.",
    "The room out at the back\na laboratory for Greg.",
    "For purposes of income tax it would be an\nexcellent setup.",
    "Greg would get calm and well again.",
    "There would be\nno more of those alarming brainstorms.",
    "The times when he looked at\nher without seeming to know who she was.",
    "Once or twice shed been\nquite frightened... And old Mr Cole  hed hinted  threatened If this\n\n\fhappens again... And it might have happened again  it would have\nhappened again.",
    "If Uncle Richard hadnt died just when he did...\n\nUncle Richard  but really why look at it like that Hed nothing to live\nfor.",
    "Old and tired and ill. His son dead.",
    "It was a mercy really.",
    "To die in\nhis sleep quietly like that.",
    "Quietly... in his sleep...",
    "If only she could\nsleep.",
    "It was so stupid lying awake hour after hour... hearing the\nfurniture creak and the rustling of trees and bushes outside the\nwindow and the occasional queer melancholy hoot  an owl she\nsupposed.",
    "How sinister the country was somehow.",
    "So different from\nthe big noisy indifferent town.",
    "One felt so safe there  surrounded by\npeople  never alone.",
    "Whereas here...",
    "Houses where a murder had been committed were sometimes\nhaunted.",
    "Perhaps this cottage would come to be known as the haunted\ncottage.",
    "Haunted by the spirit of Cora Lansquenet... Aunt Cora.",
    "Odd\nreally how ever since she had arrived she had felt as though Aunt\nCora were quite close to her... within reach.",
    "All nerves and fancy.",
    "Cora\nLansquenet was dead tomorrow she would be buried.",
    "There was no\none in the cottage except Susan herself and Miss Gilchrist.",

    "Lying there trustingly\nasleep... Knowing nothing till the hatchet fell... And now she wouldnt\nlet Susan sleep...",
    "The furniture creaked again... was that a stealthy step Susan\nswitched on the light.",
    "Nothing.",
    "Nerves nothing but nerves.",
    "Relax...\nclose your eyes...",
    "Surely that was a groan  a groan or a faint moan...",
    "Someone in pain someone dying...",
    "I mustnt imagine things I mustnt I mustnt Susan whispered to\nherself.",
    "Death was the end  there was no existence after death.",
    "Under no\ncircumstances could anyone come back.",
    "Or was she reliving a scene\nfrom the past  a dying woman groaning...",
    "There it was again... stronger... someone groaning in acute pain...",
    "But  this was real.",
    "Once again Susan switched on the light sat up in\nbed and listened.",
    "The groans were real groans and she was hearing\nthem through the wall.",
    "They came from the room next door.",

    "Who Gilchrist In Meads Lane.",
    "Yes I know.",
    "Ill be right along.",
    "He was as good as his word.",
    "Ten minutes later Susan heard his car\ndraw up outside and she went to open the door to him.",
    "She explained the case as she took him upstairs.",
    "I think she said\nshe must have eaten something that disagreed with her.",
    "But she\nseems pretty bad.",
    "The doctor had had the air of one keeping his temper in leash and who\nhas had some experience of being called out unnecessarily on more\nthan one occasion.",
    "But as soon as he examined the moaning woman\nhis manner changed.",
    "He gave various curt orders to Susan and\npresently came down and telephoned.",
    "Then he joined Susan in the\nsittingroom.",
    "Ive sent for an ambulance.",
    "Must get her into hospital.",
    "Shes really bad then\n\nYes.",
    "Ive given her a shot of morphia to ease the pain.",

    "Yes of course.",
    "Youre Mrs Lansquenets niece\n\nYes.",
    "That was a nasty business.",
    "Hope they catch the man who did it.",
    "Yes indeed.",
    "The ambulance came.",
    "Miss Gilchrist was taken away and the doctor\nwent with her.",
    "He told Susan he would ring her up in the morning.",
    "When he had left she went upstairs to bed.",
    "This time she fell asleep as\nsoon as her head touched the pillow.",
    "II\n\nThe funeral was well attended.",
    "Most of the village had turned out.",
    "Susan and Mr Entwhistle were the only mourners but various wreaths\nhad been sent by the other members of the family.",
    "Mr Entwhistle asked\nwhere Miss Gilchrist was and Susan explained the circumstances in a\nhurried whisper.",
    "Mr Entwhistle raised his eyebrows.",
    "Rather an odd occurrence\n\nOh shes better this morning.",
    "They rang up from the hospital.",
    "People\ndo get these bilious turns.",
    "Some make more fuss than others.",
    "Mr Entwhistle said no more.",
    "He was returning to London immediately\nafter the funeral.",
    "Susan went back to the cottage.",
    "She found some eggs and made\nherself an omelette.",
    "Then she went up to Coras room and started to\nsort through the dead womans things.",
    "She was interrupted by the arrival of the doctor.",
    "The doctor was looking worried.",
    "He replied to Susans inquiry by\nsaying that Miss Gilchrist was much better.",
    "Shell be out and around in a couple of days he said.",
    "But it was\nlucky I got called in so promptly.",
    "Otherwise  it might have been a near\nthing.",
    "Susan stared.",
    "Was she really so bad\n\nMrs Banks will you tell me again exactly what Miss Gilchrist had to\neat and drink yesterday.",
    "Everything.",
    "Susan reflected and gave a meticulous account.",
    "The doctor shook his\nhead in a dissatisfied manner.",
    "There must have been something she had and you didnt\n\nI dont think so... Cakes scones jam tea  and then supper.",
    "No I\ncant remember anything.",
    "The doctor rubbed his nose.",
    "He walked up and down the room.",
    "Was it definitely something she ate Definitely food poisoning\n\nThe doctor threw her a sharp glance.",
    "Then he seemed to come to a\ndecision.",
    "It was arsenic he said.",
    "Arsenic Susan stared.",
    "You mean somebody gave her arsenic\n\nThats what it looks like.",
    "Could she have taken it herself Deliberately I mean\n\nSuicide She says not and she should know.",
    "Besides if she wanted to\ncommit suicide she wouldnt be likely to choose arsenic.",
    "There are\nsleeping pills in this house.",
    "She could have taken an overdose of\nthem.",
    "Could the arsenic have got into something by accident\n\nThats what Im wondering.",
    "It seems very unlikely but such things\nhave been known.",
    "But if you and she ate the same things \n\nSusan nodded.",
    "She said It all seems impossible  then she gave a\nsudden gasp.",
    "Why of course the wedding cake\n\nWhats that Wedding cake\n\nSusan explained.",
    "The doctor listened with close attention.",
    "Odd.",
    "And you say she wasnt sure who sent it Any of it left Or is the\nbox it came in lying around\n\nI dont know.",
    "Ill look.",
    "They searched together and finally found the white cardboard box with\na few crumbs of cake still in it lying on the kitchen dresser.",
    "The doctor\npacked it away with some care.",
    "Ill take charge of this.",
    "Any idea where the wrapping paper it came in\nmight be\n\n\fHere they were not successful and Susan said that it had probably\ngone into the Ideal boiler.",
    "You wont be leaving here just yet Mrs Banks\n\nHis tone was genial but it made Susan feel a little uncomfortable.",
    "No I have to go through my aunts things.",
    "I shall be here for a few\ndays.",
    "Good.",
    "You understand the police will probably want to ask some\nquestions.",
    "You dont know of anyone who  well might have had it in for\nMiss Gilchrist\n\nSusan shook her head.",
    "I dont really know much about her.",
    "She was with my aunt for some\nyears  thats all I know.",
    "Quite quite.",
    "Always seemed a pleasant unassuming woman  quite\nordinary.",
    "Not the kind youd say to have enemies or anything\nmelodramatic of that kind.",
    "Wedding cake through the post.",
    "Sounds like\nsome jealous woman  but whod be jealous of Miss Gilchrist Doesnt\nseem to fit.",
    "No.",
    "Well I must be on my way.",
    "I dont know whats happening to us in\nquiet little Lytchett St Mary.",
    "First a brutal murder and now attempted\npoisoning through the post.",
    "Odd the one following the other.",
    "He went down the path to his car.",
    "The cottage felt stuffy and Susan left\nthe door standing open as she went slowly upstairs to resume her\ntask.",
    "Cora Lansquenet had not been a tidy or methodical woman.",
    "Her\ndrawers held a miscellaneous assortment of things.",
    "There were toilet\naccessories and letters and old handkerchiefs and paint brushes\nmixed up together in one drawer.",
    "There were a few old letters and bills\nthrust in amongst a bulging drawer of underclothes.",
    "In another drawer\nunder some woollen jumpers was a cardboard box holding two false\nfringes.",
    "There was another drawer full of old photographs and\nsketching books.",
    "Susan lingered over a group taken evidently at some\nFrench place many years ago and which showed a younger thinner\nCora clinging to the arm of a tall lanky man with a straggling beard\ndressed in what seemed to be a velveteen coat and whom Susan took\nto be the late Pierre Lansquenet.",
    "The photographs interested Susan but she laid them aside sorted all\nthe papers she had found into a heap and began to go through them\nmethodically.",
    "About a quarter way through she came on a letter.",
    "She\nread it through twice and was still staring at it when a voice speaking\nbehind her caused her to give a cry of alarm.",
    "And what may you have got hold of there Susan Hallo whats the\nmatter\n\n\fSusan reddened with annoyance.",
    "Her cry of alarm had been quite\ninvoluntary and she felt ashamed and anxious to explain.",
    "George How you startled me\n\nHer cousin smiled lazily.",
    "So it seems.",
    "How did you get here\n\nWell the door downstairs was open so I walked in.",
    "There seemed to\nbe nobody about on the ground floor so I came up here.",
    "If you mean\nhow did I get to this part of the world I started down this morning to\ncome to the funeral.",
    "I didnt see you there\n\nThe old bus played me up.",
    "The petrol feed seemed choked.",
    "I tinkered\nwith it for some time and finally it seemed to clear itself.",
    "I was too late\nfor the funeral by then but I thought I might as well come on down.",
    "I\nknew you were here.",
    "He paused and then went on\n\nI rang you up as a matter of fact  and Greg told me youd come down\nto take possession as it were.",
    "I thought I might give you a hand.",
    "Susan said Arent you needed in the office Or can you take days off\nwhenever you like\n\n\fA funeral has always been a recognised excuse for absenteeism.",
    "And\nthis funeral is indubitably genuine.",
    "Besides a murder always\nfascinates people.",
    "Anyway I shant be going much to the office in\nfuture  not now that Im a man of means.",
    "I shall have better things to\ndo.",
    "He paused and grinned Same as Greg he said.",
    "Susan looked at George thoughtfully.",
    "She had never seen much of this\ncousin of hers and when they did meet she had always found him\nrather difficult to make out.",
    "She asked Why did you really come down here George\n\nIm not sure it wasnt to do a little detective work.",
    "Ive been thinking a\ngood deal about the last funeral we attended.",
    "Aunt Cora certainly\nthrew a spanner into the works that day.",
    "Ive wondered whether it was\nsheer irresponsibility and auntly joie de vivre that prompted her\nwords or whether she really had something to go upon.",
    "What actually\nis in that letter that you were reading so attentively when I came in\n\nSusan said slowly Its a letter that Uncle Richard wrote to Cora after\nhed been down here to see her.",
    "How very black Georges eyes were.",
    "Shed thought of them as brown\nbut they were black and there was something curiously impenetrable\nabout black eyes.",
    "They concealed the thoughts that lay behind them.",
    "George drawled slowly Anything interesting in it\n\n\fNo not exactly...\n\nCan I see\n\nShe hesitated for a moment then put the letter into his outstretched\nhand.",
    "He read it skimming over the contents in a low monotone.",
    "Glad to have seen you again after all these years... looking very well...\nhad a good journey home and arrived back not too tired...\n\nHis voice changed suddenly sharpened\n\nPlease dont say anything to anyone about what I told you.",
    "It may be a\nmistake.",
    "Your loving brother Richard.",
    "He looked up at Susan.",
    "What does that mean\n\nIt might mean anything...",
    "It might be just about his health.",
    "Or it might\nbe some gossip about a mutual friend.",
    "Oh yes it might be a lot of things.",
    "It isnt conclusive  but its\nsuggestive... What did he tell Cora Does anyone know what he told\nher\n\nMiss Gilchrist might know said Susan thoughtfully.",
    "I think she\nlistened.",
    "Oh yes the Companion help.",
    "Where is she by the way\n\nIn hospital suffering from arsenic poisoning.",
    "George stared.",
    "You dont mean it\n\nI do.",
    "Someone sent her some poisoned wedding cake.",
    "George sat down on one of the bedroom chairs and whistled.",
    "It looks he said as though Uncle Richard was not mistaken.",
    "III\n\nOn the following morning Inspector Morton called at the cottage.",
    "He was a quiet middleaged man with a soft country burr in his voice.",
    "His manner was quiet and unhurried but his eyes were shrewd.",
    "You realise what this is about Mrs Banks he said.",
    "Dr Proctor has\nalready told you about Miss Gilchrist.",
    "The few crumbs of wedding cake\nthat he took from here have been analysed and show traces of\narsenic.",
    "So somebody deliberately wanted to poison her\n\nThats what it looks like.",
    "Miss Gilchrist herself doesnt seem able to\nhelp us.",
    "She keeps repeating that its impossible  that nobody would\n\n\fdo such a thing.",
    "But somebody did.",
    "You cant throw any light on the\nmatter\n\nSusan shook her head.",
    "Im simply dumbfounded she said.",
    "Cant you find out anything from\nthe postmark Or the handwriting\n\nYouve forgotten  the wrapping paper was presumably burnt.",
    "And\ntheres a little doubt whether it came through the post at all.",
    "Young\nAndrews the driver of the postal van doesnt seem able to remember\ndelivering it.",
    "Hes got a big round and he cant be sure  but there it is theres a doubt about it.",
    "But  whats the alternative\n\nThe alternative Mrs Banks is that an old piece of brown paper was\nused that already had Miss Gilchrists name and address on it and a\ncancelled stamp and that the package was pushed through the letter\nbox or deposited inside the door by hand to create the impression that\nit had come by post.",
    "He added dispassionately\n\nIts quite a clever idea you know to choose wedding cake.",
    "Lonely\nmiddleaged women are sentimental about wedding cake pleased at\nhaving been remembered.",
    "A box of sweets or something of that kind\nmight have awakened suspicion.",
    "Susan said slowly\n\n\fMiss Gilchrist speculated a good deal about who could have sent it\nbut she wasnt at all suspicious  as you say she was pleased and yes flattered.",
    "She added Was there enough poison in it to  kill\n\nThats difficult to say until we get the quantitative analysis.",
    "It rather\ndepends on whether Miss Gilchrist ate the whole of the wedge.",
    "She\nseems to think that she didnt.",
    "Can you remember\n\nNo  no Im not sure.",
    "She offered me some and I refused and then she\nate some and said it was a very good cake but I dont remember if she\nfinished it or not.",
    "Id like to go upstairs if you dont mind Mrs Banks.",
    "Of course.",
    "She followed him up to Miss Gilchrists room.",
    "She said apologetically\n\nIm afraid its in a rather disgusting state.",
    "But I didnt have time to do\nanything about it with my aunts funeral and everything and then after\nDr Proctor came I thought perhaps I ought to leave it as it was.",
    "That was very intelligent of you Mrs Banks.",
    "Its not everyone who\nwould have been so intelligent.",
    "He went to the bed and slipping his hand under the pillow raised it\ncarefully.",
    "A slow smile spread over his face.",
    "There you are he said.",
    "A piece of wedding cake lay on the sheet looking somewhat the worse\nfor wear.",
    "How extraordinary said Susan.",
    "Oh no its not.",
    "Perhaps your generation doesnt do it.",
    "Young ladies\nnowadays maynt set so much store on getting married.",
    "But its an old\ncustom.",
    "Put a piece of wedding cake under your pillow and youll\ndream of your future husband.",
    "But surely Miss Gilchrist \n\nShe didnt want to tell us about it because she felt foolish doing such a\nthing at her age.",
    "But I had a notion thats what it might be.",
    "His face\nsobered.",
    "And if it hadnt been for an old maids foolishness Miss\nGilchrist mightnt be alive today.",
    "But who could have possibly wanted to kill her\n\nHis eyes met hers a curious speculative look in them that made Susan\nfeel uncomfortable.",
    "You dont know he asked.",
    "No  of course I dont.",
    "It seems then as though we shall have to find out said Inspector\nMorton.",
    "Chapter 12\n\nTwo elderly men sat together in a room whose furnishings were of the\nmost modern kind.",
    "There were no curves in the room.",
    "Everything was\nsquare.",
    "Almost the only exception was Hercule Poirot himself who was\nfull of curves.",
    "His stomach was pleasantly rounded his head\nresembled an egg in shape and his moustaches curved upwards in a\nflamboyant flourish.",
    "He was sipping a glass of sirop and looking thoughtfully at Mr Goby.",
    "Mr Goby was small and spare and shrunken.",
    "He had always been\nrefreshingly nondescript in appearance and he was now so\nnondescript as practically not to be there at all.",
    "He was not looking at\nPoirot because Mr Goby never looked at anybody.",
    "Such remarks as he was now making seemed to be addressed to the\nlefthand corner of the chromiumplated fireplace curb.",

    "The woman recovered and the firm were all over\nthemselves apologising and there was no prosecution.",
    "After all these\naccidental slips do occur and most decent people are sorry for a poor\nyoung chap whos done it  so long as theres no permanent harm\n\n\fdone that is.",
    "The firm didnt sack him but he resigned  said it had\nshaken his nerve.",
    "But afterwards it seems he got into a very low state\nand told the doctor he was obsessed by guilt  that it had all been\ndeliberate  the woman had been overbearing and rude to him when\nshe came into the shop had complained that her last prescription had\nbeen badly made up  and that he had resented this and had\ndeliberately added a near lethal dose of some drug or other.",
    "He said\nShe had to be punished for daring to speak to me like that And then\nwept and said he was too wicked to live and a lot of things like that.",
    "The medicos have a long word for that sort of thing  guilt complex or\nsomething  and dont believe it was deliberate at all just\ncarelessness but that he wanted to make it important and serious.",
    "\u00c7a se peut said Hercule Poirot.",
    "Pardon Anyway he went into this Sanitorium and they treated him\nand discharged him as cured and he met Miss Abernethie as she was\nthen.",
    "And he got a job in this respectable but rather obscure little\nchemists shop.",
    "Told them hed been out of England for a year and a\nhalf and gave them his former reference from some shop in\nEastbourne.",
    "Nothing against him in that shop but a fellow dispenser\nsaid he had a very queer temper and was odd in his manner\nsometimes.",
    "Theres a story about a customer saying once as a joke\nWish youd sell me something to poison my wife ha ha And Banks\nsays to him very soft and quiet I could...",
    "It would cost you two\nhundred pounds.",
    "The man felt uneasy and laughed it off.",
    "May have\nbeen all a joke but it doesnt seem to me that Banks is the joking kind.",
    "Mon ami said Hercule Poirot.",
    "It really amazes me how you get your\ninformation Medical and highly confidential most of it\n\n\fMr Gobys eyes swivelled right round the room and he murmured\nlooking expectantly at the door that there were ways...\n\nNow we come to the country department.",
    "Mr and Mrs Timothy\nAbernethie.",
    "Very nice place theyve got but sadly needing money\nspent on it.",
    "Very straitened they seem to be very straitened.",

    "Complains a lot and has everyone\nrunning and fetching and carrying.",
    "Eats hearty meals and seems quite\nstrong physically if he likes to make the effort.",
    "Theres no one in the\nhouse after the daily woman goes and no ones allowed into Mr\nAbernethies room unless he rings his bell.",
    "He was in a very bad\ntemper the morning of the day after the funeral.",
    "Swore at Mrs Jones.",
    "Ate only a little of his breakfast and said he wouldnt have any lunch hed had a bad night.",
    "He said the supper she had left out for him was\nunfit to eat and a good deal more.",
    "He was alone in the house and\nunseen by anybody from 9.30 that morning until the following\nmorning.",
    "And Mrs Abernethie\n\nShe started off from Enderby by car at the time you mentioned.",
    "Arrived on foot at a small local garage in a place called Cathstone and\nexplained her car had broken down a couple of miles away.",
    "A mechanic drove her out to it made an investigation and said theyd\nhave to tow it in and it would be a long job  couldnt promise to finish it\nthat day.",
    "The lady was very put out but went to a small inn arranged\nto stay the night and asked for some sandwiches as she said shed\n\n\flike to see something of the countryside  its on the edge of the\nmoorland country.",
    "She didnt come back to the inn till quite late that\nevening.",
    "My informant said he didnt wonder.",
    "Its a sordid little place\n\nAnd the times\n\nShe got the sandwiches at eleven.",
    "If shed walked to the main road a\nmile she could have hitchhiked into Wallcaster and caught a special\nSouth Coast express which stops at Reading West.",
    "I wont go into\ndetails of buses etcetera.",
    "It could just have been done if you could\nmake the  er  attack fairly late in the afternoon.",
    "I understand the doctor stretched the time limit to possibly 4.30.",
    "Mind you said Mr Goby I shouldnt say it was likely.",
    "She seems to\nbe a nice lady liked by everybody.",
    "Shes devoted to her husband\ntreats him like a child.",
    "Yes yes the maternal complex.",
    "Shes strong and hefty chops the wood and often hauls in great\nbaskets of logs.",
    "Pretty good with the inside of a car too.",
    "I was coming to that.",
    "What exactly was wrong with the car\n\nDo you want the exact details M. Poirot\n\nHeaven forbid.",
    "I have no mechanical knowledge.",
    "It was a difficult thing to spot.",
    "And also to put right.",
    "And it could have\nbeen done maliciously by someone without very much trouble.",
    "By\nsomeone who was familiar with the insides of a car.",
    "Cest magnifique said Poirot with bitter enthusiasm.",
    "All so\nconvenient all so possible.",
    "Bon dieu can we eliminate nobody And\nMrs Leo Abernethie\n\nShes a very nice lady too.",
    "Mr Abernethie deceased was very fond of\nher.",
    "She came there to stay about a fortnight before he died.",
    "After he had been to Lytchett St Mary to see his sister\n\nNo just before.",
    "Her income is a good deal reduced since the war.",
    "She\ngave up her house in England and took a small flat in London.",
    "She has\na villa in Cyprus and spends part of the year there.",
    "She has a young\nnephew whom she is helping to educate and there seems to be one or\ntwo young artists whom she helps financially from time to time.",
    "St Helen of the blameless life said Poirot shutting his eyes.",
    "And it\nwas quite impossible for her to have left Enderby that day without the\nservants knowing Say that that is so I implore you\n\nMr Goby brought his glance across to rest apologetically on Poirots\npolished patent leather shoe the nearest he had come to a direct\nencounter and murmured\n\nIm afraid I cant say that M. Poirot.",
    "Mrs Abernethie went to London to\nfetch some extra clothes and belongings as she had agreed with Mr\nEntwhistle to stay on and see to things.",
    "Il ne manquait que \u00e7a said Poirot with strong feeling.",
    "Chapter 13\n\nWhen the card of Inspector Morton of the Berkshire County Police was\nbrought to Hercule Poirot his eyebrows went up.",
    "Show him in Georges show him in.",
    "And bring  what is it that the\npolice prefer\n\nI would suggest beer sir.",
    "How horrible But how British.",
    "Bring beer then.",
    "Inspector Morton came straight to the point.",
    "I had to come to London he said.",
    "And I got hold of your address M.\nPoirot.",
    "I was interested to see you at the inquest on Thursday.",
    "So you saw me there\n\nYes.",
    "I was surprised  and as I say interested.",
    "You wont remember\nme but I remember you very well.",
    "In that Pangbourne Case.",
    "Ah you were connected with that\n\nOnly in a very junior capacity.",
    "Its a long time ago but Ive never\nforgotten you.",
    "And you recognised me at once the other day\n\nThat wasnt difficult sir.",
    "Inspector Morton repressed a slight smile.",
    "Your appearance is  rather unusual.",
    "His gaze took in Poirots sartorial perfection and rested finally on the\ncurving moustaches.",
    "You stick out in a country place he said.",
    "It is possible it is possible said Poirot with complacency.",
    "It interested me why you should be there.",
    "That sort of crime  robbery\n assault  doesnt usually interest you.",
    "Was it the usual ordinary brutal type of crime\n\nThats what Ive been wondering.",
    "You have wondered from the beginning have you not\n\nYes M. Poirot.",
    "There were some unusual features.",
    "Since then weve\nworked along the routine lines.",
    "Pulled in one or two people for\nquestioning but everyone has been able to account quite satisfactorily\nfor his time that afternoon.",
    "It wasnt what youd call an ordinary crime\nM. Poirot  were quite sure of that.",
    "The Chief Constable agrees.",
    "It was\ndone by someone who wished to make it appear that way.",
    "It could\nhave been the Gilchrist woman but there doesnt seem to be any\nmotive  and there wasnt any emotional background.",
    "Mrs Lansquenet\nwas perhaps a bit mental  or simple if yon like to put it that way but\n\n\fit was a household of mistress and dogsbody with no feverish feminine\nfriendship about it.",
    "There are dozens of Miss Gilchrists about and\nthere not usually the murdering type.",
    "He paused.",
    "So it looks as though wed have to look farther afield.",
    "I came to ask if\nyou could help us at all.",
    "Something must have brought you down there\nM. Poirot.",
    "Yes yes something did.",
    "An excellent Daimler car.",
    "But not only that.",
    "You had  information\n\nHardly in your sense of the word.",
    "Nothing that could be used as\nevidence.",
    "But something that could be a pointer\n\nYes.",
    "You see M. Poirot there have been developments.",
    "Meticulously in detail he told of the poisoned wedge of wedding cake.",
    "Poirot took a deep hissing breath.",
    "Ingenious  yes ingenious...",
    "I warned Mr Entwhistle to look after Miss\nGilchrist.",
    "An attack on her was always a possibility.",
    "But I must confess\nthat I did not expect poison.",
    "I anticipated a repetition of the hatchet\n\n\fmotif.",
    "I merely thought that it would be inadvisable for her to walk\nalone in unfrequented lanes after dark.",
    "But why did you anticipate an attack on her I think M. Poirot you\nought to tell me that.",
    "Poirot nodded his head slowly.",
    "Yes I will tell you.",
    "Mr Entwhistle will not tell you because he is a\nlawyer and lawyers do not like to speak of suppositions of inferences\nmade from the character of a dead woman or from a few irresponsible\nwords.",
    "But he will not be averse to my telling you  no he will be\nrelieved.",
    "He does not wish to appear foolish or or fanciful but he\nwants to know what may  only may  be the facts.",
    "Poirot paused as Georges entered with a glass of beer.",
    "Some refreshment Inspector.",
    "No no I insist.",
    "Wont you join me\n\nI do not drink the beer.",
    "But I will myself have a glass of sirop de cassis\n the English they do not care for it I have noticed.",
    "Inspector Morton looked gratefully at his beer.",
    "Poirot sipping delicately from his glass of dark purple fluid said\n\nIt begins all this at a funeral.",
    "Or rather to be exact after the\nfuneral.",
    "Graphically with many gestures he set forth the story as Mr Entwhistle\nhad told it to him but with such embellishments as his exuberant\nnature suggested.",
    "One almost felt that Hercule Poirot had himself\nbeen an eyewitness of the scene.",
    "Inspector Morton had an excellent clearcut brain.",
    "He seized at once\non what were for his purposes the salient points.",
    "This Mr Abernethie may have been poisoned\n\nIt is a possibility.",
    "And the body has been cremated and there is no evidence\n\nExactly.",
    "Inspector Morton ruminated.",
    "Interesting.",
    "Theres nothing in it for us.",
    "Nothing that is to make\nRichard Abernethies death worth investigating.",
    "It would be waste of\ntime.",
    "Yes.",
    "But there are the people  the people who were there  the people who\nheard Cora Lansquenet say what she did and one of whom may have\nthought that she might say it again and with more detail.",
    "As she undoubtedly would have.",
    "There are Inspector as you say the\npeople.",
    "And now you see why I was at the inquest why I interest\nmyself in the case  because it is always people in whom I interest\nmyself.",
    "Then the attack on Miss Gilchrist \n\nWas always indicated.",
    "Richard Abernethie had been down to the\ncottage.",
    "He had talked to Cora.",
    "He had perhaps actually mentioned a\nname.",
    "The only person who might possibly have known or overheard\nsomething was Miss Gilchrist.",
    "After Cora is silenced the murderer\nmight continue to be anxious.",
    "Does the other woman know something anything Of course if the murderer is wise he will let well alone but\nmurderers Inspector are seldom wise.",
    "Fortunately for us.",
    "They\nbrood they feel uncertain they desire to make sure  quite sure.",
    "They\nare pleased with their own cleverness.",
    "And so in the end they\nprotrude their necks as you say.",
    "Inspector Morton smiled faintly.",
    "Poirot went on\n\nThis attempt to silence Miss Gilchrist already it is a mistake.",
    "For now\nthere are two occasions about which you make inquiry.",
    "There is the\nhandwriting on the wedding label also.",
    "It is a pity the wrapping paper\nwas burnt.",
    "Yes I could have been certain then whether it came by post or\nwhether it didnt.",
    "You have reason for thinking the latter you say\n\nIts only what the postman thinks  hes not sure.",
    "If the parcel had\ngone through a village post office its ten to one the postmistress\nwould have noticed it but nowadays the mail is delivered by van from\nMarket Keynes and of course the young chap does quite a round and\ndelivers a lot of things.",
    "He thinks it was letters only and no parcel at\nthe cottage  but he isnt sure.",
    "As a matter of fact hes having a bit of\ngirl trouble and he cant think about anything else.",
    "Ive tested his\nmemory and he isnt reliable in any way.",
    "If he did deliver it it seems to\nme odd that the parcel shouldnt have been noticed until after this Mr whatshisname  Guthrie \n\nAh Mr Guthrie.",
    "Inspector Morton smiled.",
    "Yes M. Poirot.",
    "Were checking up on him.",
    "After all it would be easy\nwouldnt it to come along with a plausible tale of having been a friend\nof Mrs Lansquenets.",
    "Mrs Banks wasnt to know if he was or he wasnt.",
    "He could have dropped that little parcel you know.",
    "Its easy to make a\nthing look as though its been through the post.",
    "Lamp black a little\nsmudged makes quite a good postmark cancellation mark over a\nstamp.",
    "He paused and then added\n\nAnd there are other possibilities.",
    "Poirot nodded.",
    "You think \n\nMr George Crossfield was down in that part of the world  but not until\nthe next day.",
    "Meant to attend the funeral but had a little engine trouble\non the way.",
    "Know anything about him M. Poirot\n\nA little.",
    "But not as much as I would like to know.",
    "Like that is it Quite a little bunch interested in the late Mr\nAbernethies will I understand.",
    "I hope it doesnt mean going after all of\nthem.",
    "I have accumulated a little information.",
    "It is at your disposal.",
    "Naturally\nI have no authority to ask these people questions.",
    "In fact it would not\nbe wise for me to do so.",
    "I shall go slowly myself.",
    "You dont want to fluster your bird too soon.",
    "But when you do fluster it you want to fluster it well.",
    "A very sound technique.",
    "For you then my friend the routine  with all\nthe machinery you have at your disposal.",
    "It is slow  but sure.",
    "For\nmyself \n\nYes M. Poirot\n\nFor myself I go North.",
    "As I have told you it is people in whom I\ninterest myself.",
    "Yes  a little preparatory camouflage  and I go North.",
    "I intend added Hercule Poirot to purchase a country mansion for\nforeign refugees.",
    "I represent UNARCO.",
    "And whats UNARCO\n\nUnited Nations Aid for Refugee Centres Organisation.",
    "It sounds well\ndo you not think\n\nInspector Morton grinned.",
    "Chapter 14\n\nHercule Poirot said to a grimfaced Janet\n\nThank you very much.",
    "You have been most kind.",
    "Janet her lips still fixed in a sour line left the room.",
    "These foreigners\nThe questions they asked.",
    "Their impertinence All very well to say that\nhe was a specialist interested in unsuspected heart conditions such as\nMr Abernethie must have suffered from.",
    "That was very likely true gone very sudden the master had and the doctor had been surprised.",
    "But what business was it of some foreign doctor coming along and\nnosing around\n\nAll very well for Mrs Leo to say Please answer Monsieur Pontarliers\nquestions.",
    "He has a good reason for asking.",
    "Questions.",
    "Always questions.",
    "Sheets of them sometimes to fill in as\nbest you could  and what did the Government or anyone else want to\nknow about your private affairs for Asking your age at that census \n\n\fdownright impertinent and she hadnt told them either Cut off five\nyears she had.",
    "Why not If she only felt fiftyfour shed call herself\nfiftyfour\n\nAt any rate Monsieur Pontarlier hadnt wanted to know her age.",
    "Hed\nhad some decency.",
    "Just questions about the medicines the master\nhad taken and where they were kept and if perhaps he might have\ntaken too much of them if he was feeling not quite the thing  or if hed\nbeen forgetful.",
    "As though she could remember all that rubbish  the\nmaster knew what he was doing And asking if any of the medicines he\ntook were still in the house.",
    "Naturally theyd all been thrown away.",
    "Heart condition  and some long word hed used.",
    "Always thinking of\nsomething new they were these doctors.",
    "Look at them telling old\nRogers he had a disc or some such in his spine.",
    "Plain lumbago that\nwas all that was the matter with him.",
    "Her father had been a gardener\nand hed suffered from lumbago.",
    "Doctors\n\nThe selfappointed medical man sighed and went downstairs in search\nof Lanscombe.",
    "He had not got very much out of Janet but he had\nhardly expected to do so.",
    "All he had really wanted to do was to check\nsuch information as could unwillingly be extracted from her with that\ngiven him by Helen Abernethie and which had been obtained from the\nsame source  but with much less difficulty since Janet was ready to\nadmit that Mrs Leo had a perfect right to ask such questions and\nindeed Janet herself had enjoyed dwelling at length on the last few\nweeks of her masters life.",
    "Illness and death were congenial subjects\nto her.",
    "Yes Poirot thought he could have relied on the information that Helen\nhad got for him.",
    "He had done so really.",
    "But by nature and long habit he\ntrusted nobody until he himself had tried and proved them.",
    "In any case the evidence was slight and unsatisfactory.",
    "It boiled down\nto the fact that Richard Abernethie had been prescribed vitamin oil\ncapsules.",
    "That these had been in a large bottle which had been nearly\nfinished at the time of his death.",
    "Anybody who had wanted to could\nhave operated on one or more of those capsules with a hypodermic\nsyringe and could have rearranged the bottle so that the fatal dose\nwould only be taken some weeks after that somebody had left the\nhouse.",
    "Or someone might have slipped into the house on the day\nbefore Richard Abernethie died and have doctored a capsule then  or\nwhich was more likely  have substituted something else for a sleeping\ntablet in the little bottle that stood beside the bed.",
    "Or again might have\nquite simply tampered with the food or drink.",
    "Hercule Poirot had made his own experiments.",
    "The front door was\nkept locked but there was a side door giving on the garden which was\nnot locked until evening.",
    "At about quarterpast one when the\ngardeners had gone to lunch and when the household was in the\ndiningroom Poirot had entered the grounds come to the side door\nand mounted the stairs to Richard Abernethies bedroom without\nmeeting anybody.",
    "As a variant he had pushed through a baize door\nand slipped into the larder.",
    "He had heard voices from the kitchen at\nthe end of the passage but no one had seen him.",
    "Yes it could have been done.",
    "But had it been done There was nothing\nto indicate that that was so.",
    "Not that Poirot was really looking for\nevidence  he wanted only to satisfy himself as to possibilities.",
    "The\n\n\fmurder of Richard Abernethie could only be a hypothesis.",
    "It was Cora\nLansquenets murder for which evidence was needed.",
    "What he wanted\nwas to study the people who had been assembled for the funeral that\nday and to form his own conclusions about them.",
    "He already had his\nplan but first he wanted a few more words with old Lanscombe.",
    "Lanscombe was courteous but distant.",
    "Less resentful than Janet he\nnevertheless regarded this upstart foreigner as the materialisation of\nthe Writing on the Wall.",
    "This was What We are Coming to\n\nHe put down the leather with which he was lovingly polishing the\nGeorgian teapot and straightened his back.",
    "Yes sir he said politely.",
    "Poirot sat down gingerly on a pantry stool.",
    "Mrs Abernethie tells me that you hoped to reside in the lodge by the\nnorth gate when you retired from service here\n\nThat is so sir.",
    "Naturally all that is changed now.",
    "When the property is\nsold \n\nPoirot interrupted deftly\n\nIt might still be possible.",
    "There are cottages for the gardeners.",
    "The\nlodge is not needed for the guests or their attendants.",
    "It might be\npossible to make an arrangement of some kind.",
    "Well thank you sir for the suggestion.",
    "But I hardly think  The\nmajority of the  guests would be foreigners I presume\n\nYes they will be foreigners.",
    "Amongst those who fled from Europe to\nthis country are several who are old and infirm.",
    "There can be no future\nfor them if they return to their own countries for these persons you\nunderstand are those whose relatives there have perished.",
    "They\ncannot earn their living here as an ablebodied man or woman can do.",
    "Funds have been raised and are being administered by the\norganisation which I represent to endow various country homes for\nthem.",
    "This place is I think eminently suitable.",
    "The matter is practically\nsettled.",
    "Lanscombe sighed.",
    "Youll understand sir that its sad for me to think that this wont be a\nprivate dwellinghouse any longer.",
    "But I know how things are\nnowadays.",
    "None of the family could afford to live here  and I dont\nthink the young ladies and gentlemen would even want to do so.",
    "Domestic help is too difficult to obtain these days and even if obtained\nis expensive and unsatisfactory.",
    "I quite realise that these fine\nmansions have served their turn.",
    "Lanscombe sighed again.",
    "If it has\nto be an  an institution of some kind Ill be glad to think that its the\nkind youre mentioning.",
    "We were spared in this country sir owing to\nour Navy and Air Force and our brave young men and being fortunate\nenough to be an island.",
    "If Hitler had landed here wed all have turned\nout and given him short shrift.",
    "My sight isnt good enough for shooting\nbut I could have used a pitchfork sir and I intended to do so if\nnecessary.",
    "Weve always welcomed the unfortunate in this country\nsir its been our pride.",
    "We shall continue so to do.",
    "Thank you Lanscombe said Poirot gently.",
    "Your masters death\nmust have been a great blow to you.",
    "It was sir.",
    "Id been with the master since he was quite a young man.",
    "Ive been very fortunate in my life sir.",
    "No one could have had a better\nmaster.",
    "I have been conversing with my friend and  er  colleague Dr\nLarraby.",
    "We were wondering if your master could have had any extra\nworry  any unpleasant interview  on the day before he died You do\nnot remember if any visitors came to the house that day\n\nI think not sir.",
    "I do not recall any.",
    "No one called at all just about that time\n\nThe vicar was here to tea the day before.",
    "Otherwise  some nuns\ncalled for a subscription  and a young man came to the back door and\nwanted to sell Marjorie some brushes and saucepan cleaners.",
    "Very\npersistent he was.",
    "Nobody else.",
    "A worried expression had appeared on Lanscombes face.",
    "Poirot did\nnot press him further.",
    "Lanscombe had already unburdened himself to\nMr Entwhistle.",
    "He would be far less forthcoming with Hercule Poirot.",
    "With Marjorie on the other hand Poirot had had instant success.",
    "Marjorie had none of the conventions of good service.",
    "Marjorie was a\nfirstclass cook and the way to her heart lay through her cooking.",
    "Poirot had visited her in the kitchen praised certain dishes with\n\n\fdiscernment and Marjorie realising that here was someone who knew\nwhat he was talking about hailed him immediately as a fellow spirit.",
    "He\nhad no difficulty in finding out exactly what had been served the night\nbefore Richard Abernethie had died.",
    "Marjorie indeed was inclined to\nview the matter as It was the night I made that chocolate souffl\u00e9 that\nMr Abernethie died.",
    "Six eggs Id saved up for it.",
    "The dairyman hes a\nfriend of mine.",
    "Got hold of some cream too.",
    "Better not ask how.",
    "Enjoyed it Mr Abernethie did.",
    "The rest of the meal was likewise\ndetailed.",
    "What had come out from the diningroom had been finished in\nthe kitchen.",
    "Ready as Marjorie was to talk Poirot had learned nothing\nof value from her.",
    "He went now to fetch his overcoat and a couple of scarves and thus\npadded against the North Country air he went out on the terrace and\njoined Helen Abernethie who was clipping some late roses.",
    "Have you found out anything fresh she asked.",
    "Nothing.",
    "But I hardly expected to do so.",
    "I know.",
    "Ever since Mr Entwhistle told me you were coming Ive been\nferreting round but theres really been nothing.",
    "She paused and said hopefully\n\nPerhaps it is all a mares nest\n\nTo be attacked with a hatchet\n\nI wasnt thinking of Cora.",
    "But it is of Cora that I think.",
    "Why was it necessary for someone to kill\nher Mr Entwhistle has told me that on that day at the moment that\nshe came out suddenly with her gaffe you yourself felt that something\nwas wrong.",
    "That is so\n\nWell  yes but I dont know \n\nPoirot swept on.",
    "How wrong Unexpected Surprising Or  what shall we say uneasy Sinister\n\nOh no not sinister.",
    "Just something that wasnt  oh I dont know.",
    "I\ncant remember and it wasnt important.",
    "But why cannot you remember  because something else put it out of\nyour head  something more important\n\nYes  yes  I think youre right there.",
    "It was the mention of murder I\nsuppose.",
    "That swept away everything else.",
    "It was perhaps the reaction of some particular person to the word\nmurder\n\nPerhaps...",
    "But I dont remember looking at anyone in particular.",
    "We\nwere all staring at Cora.",
    "It may have been something you heard  something dropped\nperhaps... or broken...\n\n\fHelen frowned in an effort of remembrance.",
    "No...",
    "I dont think so...\n\nAh well someday it will come back.",
    "And it may be of no consequence.",
    "Now tell me Madame of those here who knew Cora best\n\nHelen considered.",
    "Lanscombe I suppose.",
    "He remembers her from a child.",
    "The\nhousemaid Janet only came after she had married and gone away.",
    "And next to Lanscombe\n\nHelen said thoughtfully I suppose  I did.",
    "Maude hardly knew her at\nall.",
    "Then taking you as the person who knew her best why do you think\nshe asked that question as she did\n\nHelen smiled.",
    "It was very characteristic of Cora\n\nWhat I mean is was it a b\u00eatise pure and simple Did she just blurt out\nwhat was in her mind without thinking Or was she being malicious amusing herself by upsetting everyone\n\nHelen reflected.",
    "You cant ever be quite sure about a person can you I never have\nknown whether she was just ingenuous  or whether she counted\nchildishly on making an effect.",
    "Thats what you mean isnt it\n\nYes.",
    "I was thinking Suppose this Mrs Cora says to herself What fun it\nwould be to ask if Richard was murdered and see how they all look\nThat would be like her yes\n\nHelen looked doubtful.",
    "It might be.",
    "She certainly had an impish sense of humour as a child.",
    "But what difference does it make\n\nIt would underline the point that it is unwise to make jokes about\nmurder said Poirot dryly.",
    "Helen shivered.",
    "Poor Cora.",
    "Poirot changed the subject.",
    "Mrs Timothy Abernethie stayed the night after the funeral\n\nYes.",
    "Did she talk to you at all about what Cora had said\n\nYes she said it was outrageous and just like Cora\n\nShe didnt take it seriously\n\n\fOh no.",
    "No Im sure she didnt.",
    "The second no Poirot thought had sounded suddenly doubtful.",
    "But\nwas not that almost always the case when you went back over\nsomething in your mind\n\nAnd you Madame did you take it seriously\n\nHelen Abernethie her eyes looking very blue and strangely young\nunder the sideways sweep of crisp grey hair said thoughtfully\n\nYes M. Poirot I think I did.",
    "Because of your feeling that something was wrong\n\nPerhaps.",
    "He waited  but as she said nothing more he went on\n\nThere had been an estrangement lasting many years between Mrs\nLansquenet and her family\n\nYes.",
    "None of us liked her husband and she was offended about it and\nso the estrangement grew.",
    "And then suddenly your brotherinlaw went to see her.",
    "Why\n\nI dont know  I suppose he knew or guessed that he hadnt very long\nto live and wanted to be reconciled but I really dont know.",
    "He didnt tell you\n\nTell me\n\nYes.",
    "You were here staying with him just before he went there.",
    "He\ndidnt even mention his intention to you\n\nHe thought a slight reserve came into her manner.",
    "He told me that he was going to see his brother Timothy  which he\ndid.",
    "He never mentioned Cora at all.",
    "Shall we go in It must be nearly\nlunchtime.",
    "She walked beside him carrying the flowers she had picked.",
    "As they\nwent in by the side door Poirot said\n\nYou are sure quite sure that during your visit Mr Abernethie said\nnothing to you about any member of the family which might be\nrelevant\n\nA faint resentment in her manner Helen said\n\nYou are speaking like a policeman.",
    "I was a policeman  once.",
    "I have no status  no right to question you.",
    "But you want the truth  or so I have been led to believe\n\nThey entered the green drawingroom.",
    "Helen said with a sigh\n\n\fRichard was disappointed in the younger generation.",
    "Old men usually\nare.",
    "He disparaged them in various ways  but there was nothing nothing do you understand  that could possibly suggest a motive for\nmurder.",
    "Ah said Poirot.",
    "She reached for a Chinese bowl and began to\narrange the roses in it.",
    "When they were disposed to her satisfaction\nshe looked round for a place to put it.",
    "You arrange flowers admirably Madame said Hercule.",
    "I think that\nanything you undertook you would manage to do with perfection.",
    "Thank you.",
    "I am fond of flowers.",
    "I think this would look well on that\ngreen malachite table.",
    "There was a bouquet of wax flowers under a glass shade on the\nmalachite table.",
    "As she lifted it off Poirot said casually\n\nDid anyone tell Mr Abernethie that his niece Susans husband had\ncome near to poisoning a customer when making up a prescription\nAh pardon\n\nHe sprang forward.",
    "The Victorian ornament had slipped from Helens fingers.",
    "Poirots\nspring forward was not quick enough.",
    "It dropped on the floor and the\nglass shade broke.",
    "Helen gave an expression of annoyance.",
    "How careless of me.",
    "However the flowers are not damaged.",
    "I can get\na new glass shade made for it.",
    "Ill put it away in the big cupboard under\nthe stairs.",
    "It was not until Poirot had helped her to lift it on to a shelf in the dark\ncupboard and had followed her back to the drawingroom that he said\n\nIt was my fault.",
    "I should not have startled you.",
    "What was it that you asked me I have forgotten.",
    "Oh there is no need to repeat my question.",
    "Indeed  I have forgotten\nwhat it was.",
    "Helen came up to him.",
    "She laid her hand on his arm.",
    "M. Poirot is there anyone whose life would really bear close\ninvestigation Must peoples lives be dragged into this when they have\nnothing to do with  with \n\nWith the death of Cora Lansquenet Yes.",
    "Because one has to examine\neverything.",
    "Oh it is true enough  it is an old maxim  everyone has\nsomething to hide.",
    "It is true of all of us  it is perhaps true of you too\nMadame.",
    "But I say to you nothing can be ignored.",
    "That is why your\nfriend Mr Entwhistle he has come to me.",
    "For I am not the police.",
    "I am\ndiscreet and what I learn does not concern me.",
    "But I have to know.",
    "And since in this matter is not so much evidence as people  then it is\npeople with whom I occupy myself.",
    "I need madame to meet everyone\nwho was here on the day of the funeral.",
    "And it would be a great\n\n\fconvenience  yes and it would be strategically satisfactory  if I could\nmeet them here.",
    "Im afraid Helen said slowly that that would be too difficulty \n\nNot so difficult as you think.",
    "Already I have devised a means.",
    "The\nhouse it is sold.",
    "So Mr Entwhistle will declare.",
    "Entendu sometimes\nthese things fall through He will invite the various member of the\nfamily to assemble here and to choose what they will from the\nfurnishings before it is all put up to auction.",
    "A suitable weekend can be\nselected for that purpose.",
    "He paused and then said\n\nYou see it is easy is it not\n\nHelen looked at him.",
    "The blue eves were cold  almost frosty.",
    "Are you laying a trap for someone M. Poirot\n\nAlas I wish I knew enough.",
    "No I have still the open mind.",
    "There may Hercule Poirot added thoughtfully be certain tests...\n\nTests What kind of tests\n\nI have not yet formulated them to myself.",
    "And in any case Madame it\nwould be better that you should not know them.",
    "So that I can be tested too\n\n\fYou Madame have been taken behind the scenes.",
    "Now there is one\nthing that is doubtful.",
    "The young people will I think come readily.",
    "But\nit may be difficult may it not to secure the presence here of Mr\nTimothy Abernethie.",
    "I hear that he never leaves home.",
    "Helen smiled suddenly.",
    "I believe you may be lucky there M. Poirot.",
    "I heard from Maude\nyesterday.",
    "The workmen are in painting the house and Timothy is\nsuffering terribly from the smell of the paint.",
    "He says that it is seriously\naffecting his health.",
    "I think that he and Maude would both be pleased\nto come here  perhaps for a week or two.",
    "Maude is still not able to get\nabout very well  you know she broke her ankle\n\nI had not heard.",
    "How unfortunate.",
    "Luckily they have got Coras companion Miss Gilchrist.",
    "It seems that\nshe has turned out a perfect treasure.",
    "What is that Poirot turned sharply on Helen.",
    "Did they ask for Miss\nGilchrist to go to them Who suggested it\n\nI think Susan fixed it up.",
    "Susan Banks.",
    "Aha said Poirot in a curious voice.",
    "So it was the little Susan who\nsuggested it.",
    "She is fond of making the arrangements.",
    "Susan struck me as being a very competent girl.",
    "Yes.",
    "She is competent.",
    "Did you hear that Miss Gilchrist had a narrow\nescape from death with a piece of poisoned wedding cake\n\nNo Helen looked startled.",
    "I do remember now that Maude said over\nthe telephone that Miss Gilchrist had just come out of hospital but Id\nno idea why she had been in hospital.",
    "Poisoned But M. Poirot  why\n\nDo you really ask that\n\nHelen said with sudden vehemence\n\nOh get them all here Find out the truth There mustnt be any more\nmurders.",
    "So you will cooperate\n\nYes  I will cooperate.",
    "Chapter 15\n\nThat linoleum does look nice Mrs Jones.",
    "What a hand you have with\nlino.",
    "The teapots on the kitchen table so go and help yourself.",
    "Ill be\nthere as soon as Ive taken up Mr Abernethies elevenses.",
    "Miss Gilchrist trotted up the staircase carrying a daintily set out tray.",
    "She tapped on Timothys door interpreted a growl from within as an\ninvitation to enter and tripped briskly in.",
    "Morning coffee and biscuits Mr Abernethie.",
    "I do hope youre feeling\nbrighter today.",
    "Such a lovely day.",
    "Timothy grunted and said suspiciously\n\nIs there skim on that milk\n\nOh no Mr Abernethie.",
    "I took it off very carefully and anyway Ive\nbrought up the little strainer in case it should form again.",
    "Some people\nlike it you know they say its the cream  and so it is really.",
    "Idiots said Timothy.",
    "What kind of biscuits are those\n\nTheyre those nice digestive biscuits.",
    "Digestive tripe.",
    "Gingernuts are the only biscuits worth eating.",
    "Im afraid the grocer hadnt got any this week.",
    "But these are really\nvery nice.",
    "You try them and see.",
    "I know what theyre like thank you.",
    "Leave those curtains alone cant\nyou\n\nI thought you might like a little sunshine.",
    "Its such a nice sunny day.",
    "I want the room kept dark.",
    "My heads terrible.",
    "Its this paint.",
    "Ive\nalways been sensitive to paint.",
    "Its poisoning me.",
    "Miss Gilchrist sniffed experimentally and said brightly\n\nOne really cant smell it much in here.",
    "The workmen are over on the\nother side.",
    "Youre not sensitive like I am.",
    "Must I have all the books Im reading\ntaken out of my reach\n\nIm so sorry Mr Abernethie I didnt know you were reading all of\nthem.",
    "Wheres my wife I havent seen her for over an hour.",
    "Mrs Abernethies resting on the sofa.",
    "Tell her to come and rest up here.",
    "Ill tell her Mr Abernethie.",
    "But she may have dropped off to sleep.",
    "Shall we say in about a quarter of an hour\n\nNo tell her I want her now.",
    "Dont monkey about with that rug.",
    "Its\narranged the way I like it.",
    "Im so sorry.",
    "I thought it was slipping off the far side.",
    "I like it slipping off.",
    "Go and get Maude.",
    "I want her.",
    "Miss Gilchrist departed downstairs and tiptoed into the drawingroom\nwhere Maude Abernethie was sitting with her leg up reading a novel.",
    "Im so sorry Mrs Abernethie she said apologetically.",
    "Mr Abernethie\nis asking for you.",
    "Maude thrust aside her novel with a guilty expression.",
    "Oh dear she said Ill go up at once.",
    "She reached for her stick.",
    "Timothy burst out as soon as his wife entered the room\n\nSo there you are at last\n\nIm so sorry dear I didnt know you wanted me.",
    "That woman youve got into the house will drive me mad.",
    "Twittering\nand fluttering round like a demented hen.",
    "Real typical old maid thats\nwhat she is.",
    "Im sorry she annoys you.",
    "She tries to be kind thats all.",
    "I dont want anybody kind.",
    "I dont want a blasted old maid always\nchirruping over me.",
    "Shes so damned arch too \n\nJust a little perhaps.",
    "Treats me as though I was a confounded kid Its maddening.",
    "Im sure it must be.",
    "But please please Timothy do try not to be rude\nto her.",
    "Im really very helpless still and you yourself say she cooks\nwell.",
    "Her cookings all right Mr Abernethie admitted grudgingly.",
    "Yes\nshes a decent enough cook.",
    "But keep her in the kitchen thats all I\nask.",
    "Dont let her come fussing round me.",
    "No dear of course not.",
    "How are you feeling\n\nNot at all well.",
    "I think youd better send for Barton to come and have a\nlook at me.",
    "This paint affects my heart.",
    "Feel my pulse  the irregular\nway its beating.",
    "Maude felt it without comment.",
    "Timothy shall we go to an hotel until the house painting is finished\n\nIt would be a great waste of money.",
    "Does that matter so much now\n\nYoure just like all women  hopelessly extravagant Just because\nweve come into a ridiculously small part of my brothers estate you\nthink we can go and live indefinitely at the Ritz.",
    "I didnt quite say that dear.",
    "I can tell you that the difference Richards money will make will be\nhardly appreciable.",
    "This bloodsucking Government will see to that.",
    "You mark my words the whole lot will go in taxation.",
    "Mrs Abernethie shook her head sadly.",
    "This coffees cold said the invalid looking with distaste at the cup\nwhich he had not as yet tasted.",
    "Why cant I ever get a cup of really hot\ncoffee\n\nIll take it down and warm it up.",
    "In the kitchen Miss Gilchrist was drinking tea and conversing affably\nthough with slight condescension with Mrs Jones.",
    "Im so anxious to spare Mrs Abernethie all I can she said.",
    "All this\nrunning up and down stairs is so painful for her.",
    "Waits on him hand and foot she does said Mrs Jones stirring the\nsugar in her cup.",
    "Its very sad his being such an invalid.",
    "Not such an invalid either Mrs Jones said darkly.",
    "Suits him very\nwell to lie up and ring bells and have trays brought up and down.",
    "But\nhes well able to get up and go about.",
    "Even seen him out in the village I\nhave when shes been away.",
    "Walking as hearty as you please.",
    "Anything he really needs  like his tobacco or a stamp  he can come\nand get.",
    "And thats why when she was off at that funeral and got held\nup on the way back and he told me Id got to come in and stay the\nnight again I refused.",
    "Im sorry sir I said but Ive got my husband to\nthink of.",
    "Going out to oblige in the mornings is all very well but Ive got\nto be there to see to him when he comes back from work.",
    "Nor I\nwouldnt budge I wouldnt.",
    "Do him good I thought to get about the\nhouse and look after himself for once.",
    "Might make him see what a lot\nhe gets done for him.",
    "So I stood firm I did.",
    "He didnt half create.",
    "Mrs Jones drew a deep breath and took a long satisfying drink of\nsweet inky tea.",
    "Ar she said.",
    "Though deeply suspicious of Miss Gilchrist and considering her as a\nfinicky thing and a regular fussy old maid Mrs Jones approved of the\nlavish way in which Miss Gilchrist dispensed her employers tea and\nsugar ration.",
    "She set down the cup and said affably\n\nIll give the kitchen floor a nice scrub down and then Ill be getting\nalong.",
    "The potatoes is all ready peeled dear youll find them by the\nsink.",
    "Though\n\nslightly\n\naffronted\n\nby\n\nthe\n\ndear\n\nMiss\n\nGilchrist\n\nwas\n\nappreciative of the goodwill which had divested an enormous quantity\nof potatoes of their outer coverings.",
    "Before she could say anything the telephone rang and she hurried out\nin the hall to answer it.",
    "The telephone in the style of fifty odd years\nago was situated inconveniently in a draughty passage behind the\nstaircase.",
    "Maude Abernethie appeared at the top of the stairs while Miss Gilchrist\nwas still speaking.",
    "The latter looked up and said\n\nIts Mrs  Leo  is it  Abernethie speaking.",
    "Tell her Im just coming.",
    "Maude descended the stairs slowly and painfully.",
    "Miss Gilchrist murmured Im so sorry youve had to come down\nagain Mrs Abernethie.",
    "Has Mr Abernethie finished his elevenses Ill\njust nip up and get the tray.",
    "She trotted up the stairs as Mrs Abernethie said into the receiver.",
    "Helen This is Maude here.",
    "The invalid received Miss Gilchrist with a baleful glare.",
    "As she picked\nup the tray he asked fretfully\n\nWhos that on the telephone\n\nMrs Leo Abernethie.",
    "Oh Suppose theyll go gossiping for about an hour.",
    "Women have no\nsense of time when they get on the phone.",
    "Never think of the money\ntheyre wasting.",
    "Miss Gilchrist said brightly that it would be Mrs Leo who had to pay\nand Timothy grunted.",
    "Just pull that curtain aside will you No not that one the other one.",
    "I\ndont want the light slap in my eyes.",
    "Thats better.",
    "No reason because\nIm an invalid that I should have to sit in the dark all day.",
    "He went on\n\n\fAnd you might look in that bookcase over there for a green  Whats\nthe matter now What are you rushing off for\n\nIts the front door Mr Abernethie.",
    "I didnt hear anything.",
    "Youve got that woman downstairs havent\nyou Let her go and answer it.",
    "Yes Mr Abernethie.",
    "What was the book you wanted me to find\n\nThe invalid closed his eyes.",
    "I cant remember now.",
    "Youve put it out of my head.",
    "Youd better go.",
    "Miss Gilchrist seized the tray and hurriedly departed.",
    "Putting the tray\non the pantry table she hurried into the front hall passing Mrs\nAbernethie who was still at the telephone.",
    "She returned in a moment to ask in a muted voice\n\nIm so sorry to interrupt.",
    "Its a nun.",
    "Collecting.",
    "The Heart of Mary\nFund I think she said.",
    "She has a book.",
    "Half a crown or five shillings\nmost people seem to have given.",
    "Maude Abernethie said\n\nJust a moment Helen into the telephone and to Miss Gilchrist I\ndont subscribe to Roman Catholics.",
    "We have our own Church\ncharities.",
    "Miss Gilchrist hurried away again.",
    "Maude terminated her conversation after a few minutes with the\nphrase Ill talk to Timothy about it.",
    "She replaced the receiver and came into the front hall.",
    "Miss Gilchrist\nwas standing quite still by the drawingroom door.",
    "She was frowning in\na puzzled way and jumped when Maude Abernethie spoke to her.",
    "Theres nothing the matter is there Miss Gilchrist\n\nOh no Mrs Abernethie Im afraid I was just woolgathering.",
    "So stupid\nof me when theres so much to be done.",
    "Miss Gilchrist resumed her imitation of a busy ant and Maude\nAbernethie climbed the stairs slowly and painfully to her husbands\nroom.",
    "That was Helen on the telephone.",
    "It seems that the place is definitely\nsold some Institution for Foreign Refugees \n\nShe paused whilst Timothy expressed himself forcefully on the subject\nof Foreign Refugees with side issues as to the house in which he had\nbeen born and brought up.",
    "No decent standards left in this country.",
    "My old home I can hardly bear to think of it.",
    "Maude went on.",
    "Helen quite appreciates what you  we  will feel about it.",
    "She\nsuggests that we might like to come there for a visit before it goes.",
    "She\nwas very distressed about your health and the way the painting is\naffecting it.",
    "She thought you might prefer coming to Enderby to going\nto an hotel.",
    "The servants are there still so you could be looked after\ncomfortably.",
    "Timothy whose mouth had been open in outraged protests halfway\nthrough this had closed it again.",
    "His eyes had become suddenly\nshrewd.",
    "He now nodded his head approvingly.",
    "Thoughtful of Helen he said.",
    "Very thoughtful.",
    "I dont know Im sure\nIll have to think it over... Theres no doubt that this paint is poisoning\nme  theres arsenic in paint I believe.",
    "I seem to have heard something\nof the kind.",
    "On the other hand the exertion of moving might be too\nmuch for me.",
    "Its difficult to know what would be the best.",
    "Perhaps youd prefer an hotel dear said Maude.",
    "A good hotel is\nvery expensive but where your health is concerned \n\nTimothy interrupted.",
    "I wish I could make you understand Maude that we are not\nmillionaires.",
    "Why go to an hotel when Helen has very kindly suggested\nthat we should go to Enderby Not that its really for her to suggest\nThe house isnt hers.",
    "I dont understand legal subtleties but I presume\nit belongs to us equally until its sold and the proceeds divided.",
    "Foreign\nRefugees It would have made old Cornelius turn in his grave.",
    "Yes he\nsighed I should like to see the old place again before I die.",
    "Maude played her last card adroitly.",
    "I understand that Mr Entwhistle has suggested that the members of\nthe family might like to choose certain pieces of furniture or china or\nsomething  before the contents are put up for auction.",
    "Timothy heaved himself briskly upright.",
    "We must certainly go.",
    "There must be a very exact valuation of what is\nchosen by each person.",
    "Those men the girls have married  I wouldnt\ntrust either of them from what Ive heard.",
    "There might be some sharp\npractice.",
    "Helen is far too amiable.",
    "As the head of the family it is my\nduty to be present\n\nHe got up and walked up and down the room with a brisk vigorous\ntread.",
    "Yes it is an excellent plan.",
    "Write to Helen and accept.",
    "What I am\nreally thinking about is you my dear.",
    "It will be a nice rest and change\nfor you.",
    "You have been doing far too much lately.",
    "The decorators can\nget on with the painting while we are away and that Gillespie woman\ncan stay here and look after the house.",
    "Gilchrist said Maude.",
    "Timothy waved a hand and said that it was all the same.",
    "II\n\nI cant do it said Miss Gilchrist.",
    "Maude looked at her in surprise.",
    "Miss Gilchrist was trembling.",
    "Her eyes looked pleadingly into Maudes.",
    "Its stupid of me I know...",
    "But I simply cant.",
    "Not stay here all alone in\nthe house.",
    "If there was anyone who could come and  and sleep here\ntoo\n\nShe looked hopefully at the other woman but Maude shook her head.",
    "Maude Abernethie knew only too well how difficult it was to get anyone\nin the neighbourhood to live in.",
    "Miss Gilchrist went on a kind of desperation in her voice.",
    "I know youll\nthink it nervy and foolish  and I wouldnt have dreamed once that Id\never feel like this.",
    "Ive never been a nervous woman  or fanciful.",
    "But\nnow it all seems different.",
    "Id be terrified  yes literally terrified  to be\nall alone here.",
    "Of course said Maude.",
    "Its stupid of me.",
    "After what happened at\nLytchett St Mary.",
    "I suppose thats it... Its not logical I know.",
    "And I didnt feel it at first.",
    "I\ndidnt mind being alone in the cottage after  after it had happened.",
    "The feelings grown up gradually.",
    "Youll have no opinion of me at all\nMrs Abernethie but even since Ive been here Ive been feeling it frightened you know.",
    "Not of anything in particular  but just\nfrightened... Its so silly and I really am ashamed.",
    "Its just as though all\nthe time I was expecting something awful to happen...",
    "Even that nun\ncoming to the door startled me.",
    "Oh dear I am in a bad way...",
    "I suppose its what they call delayed shock said Maude vaguely.",
    "Is it I dont know.",
    "Oh dear Im so sorry to appear so  so ungrateful\nand after all your kindness.",
    "What you will think \n\nMaude soothed her.",
    "We must think of some other arrangement she said.",
    "Chapter 16\n\nGeorge Crossfield paused irresolutely for a moment as he watched a\nparticular feminine back disappear through a doorway.",
    "Then he\nnodded to himself and went in pursuit.",
    "The doorway in question was that of a doublefronted shop  a shop\nthat had gone out of business.",
    "The plateglass windows showed a\ndisconcerting emptiness within.",
    "The door was closed but George\nrapped on it.",
    "A vacuous faced young man with spectacles opened it\nand stared at George.",
    "Excuse me said George.",
    "But I think my cousin just came in here.",
    "The young man drew back and George walked in.",
    "Hallo Susan he said.",
    "Susan who was standing on a packingcase and using a footrule\nturned her head in some surprise.",
    "Hallo George.",
    "Where did you spring from\n\nI saw your back.",
    "I was sure it was yours.",
    "How clever of you.",
    "I suppose backs are distinctive.",
    "Much more so than faces.",
    "Add a beard and pads in your cheeks and\ndo a few things to your hair and nobody will know you when you come\nface to face with them  but beware of the moment when you walk\naway.",
    "Ill remember.",
    "Can you remember seven feet five inches until Ive got\ntime to write it down.",
    "Certainly.",
    "What is this book shelves\n\nNo cubicle space.",
    "Eight feet nine  and three seven...",
    "The young\nman with the spectacles who had been fidgeting from one foot to the\nother coughed apologetically.",
    "Excuse me Mrs Banks but if you want to be here for some time \n\nI do rather said Susan.",
    "If you leave the keys Ill lock the door and\nreturn them to the office when I go past.",
    "Will that be all right\n\nYes thank you.",
    "If it werent that were short staffed this morning \n\nSusan accepted the apologetic intent of the halffinished sentence and\nthe young man removed himself to the outer world of the street.",
    "Im glad weve got rid of him said Susan.",
    "House agents are a\nbother.",
    "They will keep talking just when I want to do sums.",
    "Ah said George.",
    "Murder in an empty shop.",
    "How exciting it would be\nfor the passersby to see the dead body of a beautiful young woman\ndisplayed behind plate glass.",
    "How they would goggle.",
    "Like goldfish.",
    "There wouldnt be any reason for you to murder me George.",
    "Well I should get a fourth part of your share of our esteemed uncles\nestate.",
    "If one were sufficiently fond of money that should be a reason.",
    "Susan stopped taking measurements and turned to look at him.",
    "Her\neyes opened a little.",
    "You look a different person George.",
    "Its really  extraordinary.",
    "Different How different\n\nLike an advertisement.",
    "This is the same man that you saw overleaf\nbut now he has taken Uppingtons Health Salts.",
    "She sat down on another packingcase and lit a cigarette.",
    "You must have wanted your share of old Richards money pretty\nbadly George\n\nNobody could honestly say that money isnt welcome these days.",
    "Georges tone was light.",
    "Susan said You were in a jam werent you\n\nHardly your business is it Susan\n\nI was just interested.",
    "Are you renting this shop as a place of business\n\nIm buying the whole house.",
    "With possession\n\nYes.",
    "The two upper floors were flats.",
    "Ones empty and went with the\nshop.",
    "The other Im buying the people out.",
    "Nice to have money isnt it Susan\n\nThere was a malicious tone in Georges voice.",
    "But Susan merely took a\ndeep breath and said\n\nAs far as Im concerned its wonderful.",
    "An answer to prayer.",
    "Does prayer kill off elderly relatives\n\nSusan paid no attention.",
    "This place is exactly right.",
    "To begin with its a very good piece of\nperiod architecture.",
    "I can make the living part upstairs something\n\n\fquite unique.",
    "There are two lovely moulded ceilings and the rooms are\na beautiful shape.",
    "This part down here which has already been hacked\nabout I shall have completely modern.",
    "What is this A dress business\n\nNo.",
    "Beauty culture.",
    "Herbal preparations.",
    "Face creams\n\nThe full racket\n\nThe racket as before.",
    "It pays.",
    "It always pays.",
    "What you need to put it\nover is personality.",
    "I can do it.",
    "George looked at his cousin appreciatively.",
    "He admired the slanting\nplanes of her face the generous mouth the radiant colouring.",
    "Altogether an unusual and vivid face.",
    "And he recognised in Susan that\nodd indefinable quality the quality of success.",
    "Yes he said I think youve got what it takes Susan.",
    "Youll get back\nyour outlay on this scheme and youll get places with it.",
    "Its the right neighbourhood just off main shopping street and you\ncan park a car right in front of the door.",
    "Again George nodded.",
    "Yes Susan youre going to succeed.",
    "Have you had this in mind for a\nlong time\n\nOver a year\n\n\fWhy didnt you put it up to old Richard He might have staked you.",
    "I did put it up to him.",
    "And he didnt see his way I wonder why.",
    "I should have thought hed\nhave recognised the same mettle that he himself was made of.",
    "Susan did not answer and into Georges mind there leapt a swift birds\neye view of another figure.",
    "A thin nervous suspiciouseyed young\nman.",
    "Where does  whats his name  Greg  come in on all this he asked.",
    "Hell give up dishing out pills and powders I take it\n\nOf course.",
    "There will be a laboratory built out at the back.",
    "We shall\nhave our own formulas for face creams and beauty preparations.",
    "George suppressed a grin.",
    "He wanted to say So baby is to have his\nplay pen but he did not say it.",
    "As a cousin he did not mind being\nspiteful but he had an uneasy sense that Susans feeling for her\nhusband was a thing to be treated with care.",
    "It had all the qualities of a\ndangerous explosive.",
    "He wondered as he had wondered on the day of\nthe funeral about that queer fish Gregory.",
    "Something odd about the\nfellow.",
    "So nondescript in appearance  and yet in some way not\nnondescript...",
    "He looked again at Susan calmly and radiantly triumphant.",
    "Youve got the true Abernethie touch he said.",
    "The only one of the\nfamily who has.",
    "Pity as far as old Richard was concerned that youre a\nwoman.",
    "If youd been a boy I bet hed have left you the whole\ncaboodle.",
    "Susan said slowly Yes I think he would.",
    "She paused and then went on\n\nHe didnt like Greg you know...\n\nAh.",
    "George raised his eyebrows.",
    "His mistake.",
    "Yes.",
    "Oh well.",
    "Anyway things are going well now  all going according to\nplan.",
    "As he said the words he was struck by the fact that they seemed\nparticularly applicable to Susan.",
    "The idea made him just for a moment a shade uncomfortable.",
    "He didnt really like a woman who was so coldbloodedly efficient.",
    "Changing the subject he said\n\nBy the way did you get a letter from Helen About Enderby\n\nYes I did.",
    "This morning.",
    "Did you\n\n\fYes.",
    "What are you going to do about it\n\nGreg and I thought of going up the weekend after next  if that suits\neveryone else.",
    "Helen seemed to want us all together.",
    "George laughed shrewdly.",
    "Or somebody might choose a more valuable piece of furniture than\nsomebody else\n\nSusan laughed.",
    "Oh I suppose there is a proper valuation.",
    "But a valuation for probate\nwill be much lower than the things would be in the open market.",
    "And\nbesides Id quite like to have a few relics of the founder of the family\nfortunes.",
    "Then I think it would be amusing to have one or two really\nabsurd and charming specimens of the Victorian age in this place.",
    "Make a kind of thing of them That periods coming in now.",
    "There was a\ngreen malachite table in the drawingroom.",
    "You could build quite a\ncolour scheme around it.",
    "And perhaps a case of stuffed humming birds\n or one of those crowns made of waxed flowers.",
    "Something like that just as a keynote  can be very effective.",
    "I trust your judgment.",
    "Youll be there I suppose\n\nOh I shall be there  to see fair play if nothing else.",
    "Susan laughed.",
    "What do you bet there will be a grand family row she asked.",
    "Rosamund will probably want your green malachite table for a stage\nset\n\nSusan did not laugh.",
    "Instead she frowned.",
    "Have you seen Rosamund lately\n\nI have not seen beautiful Cousin Rosamund since we all came back\nthirdclass from the funeral.",
    "Ive seen her once or twice... She  she seemed rather odd \n\nWhat was the matter with her Trying to think\n\nNo.",
    "She seemed  well  upset.",
    "Upset about coming into a lot of money and being able to put on some\nperfectly frightful play in which Michael can make an ass of himself\n\nOh thats going ahead and it does sound frightful  but all the same it\nmay be a success.",
    "Michaels good you know.",
    "He can put himself\nacross the footlights  or whatever the term is.",
    "Hes not like Rosamund\nwhos just beautiful and ham.",
    "Poor beautiful ham Rosamund.",
    "All the same Rosamund is not quite so dumb as one might think.",
    "She\nsays things that are quite shrewd sometimes.",
    "Things that you wouldnt\nhave imagined shed even noticed.",
    "Its  its quite disconcerting.",
    "Quite like our Aunt Cora \n\nYes...\n\nA momentary uneasiness descended on them both  conjured up it\nseemed by the mention of Cora Lansquenet.",
    "Then George said with a rather elaborate air of unconcern\n\nTalking of Cora  what about that companion woman of hers I rather\nthink something ought to be done about her.",
    "Done about her What do you mean\n\nWell its up to the family so to speak.",
    "I mean Ive been thinking Cora\nwas our Aunt  and it occurred to me that this woman maynt find it\neasy to get another post.",
    "That occurred to you did it\n\nYes.",
    "People are so careful of their skins.",
    "I dont say theyd actually\nthink that this Gilchrist female would take a hatchet to them  but at the\nback of their minds theyd feel that it might be unlucky.",
    "People are\nsuperstitious.",
    "How odd that you should have thought of all that George How would\nyou know about things like that\n\nGeorge said dryly\n\nYou forget that Im a lawyer.",
    "I see a lot of the queer illogical side of\npeople.",
    "What Im getting at is that I think we might do something about\nthe woman give her a small allowance or something to tide her over\nor find some office post for her if shes capable of that sort of thing.",
    "I\nfeel rather as though we ought to keep in touch with her.",
    "You neednt worry said Susan.",
    "Her voice was dry and ironic.",
    "Ive\nseen to things.",
    "Shes gone to Timothy and Maude.",
    "George looked startled.",
    "I say Susan  is that wise\n\nIt was the best thing I could think of  at the moment.",
    "George looked at her curiously.",
    "Youre very sure of yourself arent you Susan You know what youre\ndoing and you dont have  regrets.",
    "Susan said lightly\n\nIts a waste of time  having regrets.",
    "Chapter 17\n\n\fMichael tossed the letter across the table to Rosamund.",
    "What about it\n\nOh well go.",
    "Dont you think so\n\nMichael said slowly\n\nIt might be as well.",
    "There might be some jewellery... Of course all the things in the house\nare quite hideous  stuffed birds and wax flowers  ugh\n\nYes.",
    "Bit of a mausoleum.",
    "As a matter of fact Id like to make a sketch\nor two  particularly in that drawingroom.",
    "The mantelpiece for\ninstance and that very odd shaped couch.",
    "Theyd be just right for The\nBaronets Progress  if we revive it.",
    "He got up and looked at his watch.",
    "That reminds me.",
    "I must go round and see Rosenheim.",
    "Dont expect\nme until rather late this evening.",
    "Im dining with Oscar and were going\ninto the question of taking up that option and how it fits in with the\nAmerican offer.",
    "Darling Oscar.",
    "Hell be pleased to see you after all this time.",
    "Give him\nmy love.",
    "Michael looked at her sharply.",
    "He no longer smiled and his face had an\nalert predatory look.",
    "What do you mean  after all this time Anyone would think I hadnt\nseen him for months.",
    "Well you havent have you murmured Rosamund.",
    "Yes I have.",
    "We lunched together only a week ago.",
    "How funny.",
    "He must have forgotten about it.",
    "He rang up yesterday\nand said he hadnt seen you since the first night of Tilly Looks West.",
    "The old fool must be off his head.",
    "Michael laughed.",
    "Rosamund her eyes wide and blue looked at him\nwithout emotion.",
    "You think Im a fool dont you Mick\n\nMichael protested.",
    "Darling of course I dont.",
    "Yes you do.",
    "But Im not an absolute nitwit.",
    "You didnt go near Oscar\nthat day.",
    "I know where you did go.",
    "Rosamund darling  what do you mean\n\nI mean I know where you really were...\n\n\fMichael his attractive face uncertain stared at his wife.",
    "She stared\nback at him placid unruffled.",
    "How very disconcerting he suddenly thought a really empty stare\ncould be.",
    "He said rather unsuccessfully\n\nI dont know what youre driving at...",
    "I just meant its rather silly telling me a lot of lies.",
    "Look here Rosamund \n\nHe had started to bluster  but he stopped taken aback as his wife said\nsoftly\n\nWe do want to take up this option and put this play on dont we\n\nWant to Its the part Ive always dreamed must exist somewhere.",
    "Yes  thats what I mean.",
    "Just what do you mean\n\nWell  its worth a good deal isnt it But one mustnt take too many\nrisks.",
    "He stared at her and said slowly\n\n\fIts your money  I know that.",
    "If you dont want to risk it \n\nIts our money darling.",
    "Rosamund stressed it.",
    "I think thats rather\nimportant.",
    "Listen darling.",
    "The part of Eileen  it would bear writing up.",
    "Rosamund smiled.",
    "I dont think  really  I want to play it.",
    "My dear girl.",
    "Michael was aghast.",
    "Whats come over you\n\nNothing.",
    "Yes there is youve been different lately  moody  nervous what is\nit\n\nNothing.",
    "I only want you to be  careful Mick.",
    "Careful about what Im always careful.",
    "No I dont think you are.",
    "You alway think you can get away with things\nand that everyone will believe whatever you want them to.",
    "You were\nstupid about Oscar that day.",
    "Michael flushed angrily.",
    "And what about you You said you were going shopping with Jane.",
    "You didnt.",
    "Janes in America has been for weeks.",
    "Yes said Rosamund.",
    "That was stupid too.",
    "I really just went for a\nwalk in Regents Park.",
    "Michael looked at her curiously.",
    "Regents Park You never went for a walk in Regents Park in your\nlife.",
    "Whats it all about Have you got a boy friend You may say what\nyou like Rosamund you have been different lately.",
    "Why\n\nIve been  thinking about things.",
    "About what to do...\n\nMichael came round the table to her in a satisfying spontaneous rush.",
    "His voice held fervour as he cried\n\nDarling  you know I love you madly\n\nShe responded satisfactorily to the embrace but as they drew apart\nhe was struck again disagreeably by the odd calculation in those\nbeautiful eyes.",
    "Whatever Id done youd always forgive me wouldnt you he\ndemanded.",
    "I suppose so said Rosamund vaguely.",
    "Thats not the point.",
    "You see\nits all different now.",
    "Weve got to think and plan.",
    "Think and plan what\n\n\fRosamund frowning said\n\nThings arent over when youve done them.",
    "Its really a sort of\nbeginning and then ones got to arrange what to do next and whats\nimportant and what is not.",
    "Rosamund...\n\nShe sat her face perplexed her wide gaze on a middle distance in\nwhich Michael apparently did not feature.",
    "At the third repetition of her name she started slightly and came out of\nher reverie.",
    "What did you say\n\nI asked you what you were thinking about...\n\nOh Oh yes I was wondering if Id go down to  what is it  Lytchett St\nMary and see that Miss Somebody  the one who was with Aunt Cora.",
    "But why\n\nWell shell be going away soon wont she To relatives or someone.",
    "I\ndont think we ought to let her go away until weve asked her.",
    "Asked her what\n\nAsked her who killed Aunt Cora.",
    "Michael stared.",
    "You mean  you think she knows\n\nRosamund said rather absently\n\nOh yes I expect so... She lived there you see.",
    "But shed have told the police.",
    "Oh I dont mean she knows that way  I just mean that shes probably\nquite sure.",
    "Because of what Uncle Richard said when he went down\nthere.",
    "He did go down there you know Susan told me so.",
    "But she wouldnt have heard what he said.",
    "Oh yes she would darling.",
    "Rosamund sounded like someone\narguing with an unreasonable child.",
    "Nonsense I can hardly see old Richard Abernethie discussing his\nsuspicions of his family before an outsider.",
    "Well of course.",
    "Shed have heard it through the door.",
    "Eavesdropping you mean\n\nI expect so  in fact Im sure.",
    "It must be so deadly dull shut up two\nwomen in a cottage and nothing ever happening except washing up\n\n\fand the sink and putting the cat out and things like that.",
    "Of course she\nlistened and read letters  anyone would.",
    "Michael looked at her with something faintly approaching dismay.",
    "Would you he demanded bluntly.",
    "I wouldnt go and be a companion in the country.",
    "Rosamund\nshuddered.",
    "Id rather die.",
    "I meant  would you read letters and  and all that\n\nRosamund said calmly\n\nIf I wanted to know yes.",
    "Everybody does dont you think so\n\nThe limpid gaze met his.",
    "One just wants to know said Rosamund.",
    "One doesnt want to do\nanything about it.",
    "I expect thats how she feels  Miss Gilchrist I mean.",
    "But Im certain she knows.",
    "Michael said in a stifled voice\n\nRosamund who do you think killed Cora And old Richard\n\nOnce again that limpid blue gaze met his.",
    "Darling  dont be absurd... You know as well as I do.",
    "But its much\nmuch better never to mention it.",
    "So we wont.",
    "Chapter 18\n\nFrom his seat by the fireplace in the library Hercule Poirot looked at\nthe assembled company.",
    "His eyes passed thoughtfully over Susan sitting upright looking vivid\nand animated over her husband sitting near her his expression\nrather vacant and his fingers twisting a loop of string they went on to\nGeorge Crossfield debonair and distinctly pleased with himself\ntalking about card sharpers on atlantic cruises to Rosamund who said\nmechanically How extraordinary darling.",
    "But why in a completely\nuninterested voice went on to Michael with his very individual type of\nhaggard good looks and his very apparent charm to Helen poised\nand slightly remote to Timothy comfortably settled in the best\narmchair with an extra cushion at his back and Maude sturdy and\nthickset in devoted attendance and finally to the figure sitting with a\ntinge of apology just beyond the range of the family circle  the figure\nof Miss Gilchrist wearing a rather peculiar dressy blouse.",
    "Presently\nhe judged she would get up murmur an excuse and leave the family\ngathering and go up to her room.",
    "Miss Gilchrist he thought knew her\nplace.",
    "She had learned it the hard way.",
    "Hercule Poirot sipped his afterdinner coffee and between halfclosed\nlids made his appraisal.",
    "He had wanted them there  all together and he had got them.",
    "And\nwhat he thought to himself was he going to do with them now He felt\na sudden weary distaste for going on with the business.",
    "Why was that\nhe wondered Was it the influence of Helen Abernethie There was a\n\n\fquality of passive resistance about her that seemed unexpectedly\nstrong.",
    "Had she while apparently graceful and unconcerned\nmanaged to impress her own reluctance upon him She was averse to\nthis raking up of the details of old Richards death he knew that.",
    "She\nwanted it left alone left to die out into oblivion.",
    "Poirot was not\nsurprised by that.",
    "What did surprise him was his own disposition to\nagree with her.",
    "Mr Entwhistles account of the family had he realised been admirable.",
    "He had described all these people shrewdly and well.",
    "With the old\nlawyers knowledge and appraisal to guide him Poirot had wanted to\nsee for himself.",
    "He had fancied that meeting these people intimately\nhe would have a very shrewd idea  not of how and when  those were\nquestions with which he did not propose to concern himself.",
    "Murder\nhad been possible  that was all he needed to know but of who.",
    "For\nHercule Poirot had a lifetime of experience behind him and as a man\nwho deals with pictures can recognise the artist so Poirot believed he\ncould recognise a likely type of the amateur criminal who will  if his\nown particular need arises be prepared to kill.",
    "But it was not to be so easy.",
    "Because he could visualise almost all of those people as a possible though not a probable  murderer.",
    "George might kill  as the cornered\nrat kills.",
    "Susan calmly  efficiently  to further a plan.",
    "Gregory because\nhe had that queer morbid streak which discounts and invites almost\ncraves punishment.",
    "Michael because he was ambitious and had a\nmurderers cocksure vanity.",
    "Rosamund because she was frighteningly\nsimple in outlook.",
    "Timothy because he had hated and resented his\nbrother and had craved the power his brothers money would give.",
    "Maude because Timothy was her child and where her child was\nconcerned she would be ruthless.",
    "Even Miss Gilchrist he thought\nmight have contemplated murder if it could have restored to her the\nWillow Tree in its ladylike glory\n\nAnd Helen He could not see Helen as committing murder.",
    "She was\ntoo civilised  too removed from violence.",
    "And she and her husband\nhad surely loved Richard Abernethie.",
    "Poirot sighed to himself.",
    "There were to be no short cuts to the truth\nInstead he would have to adopt a longer but a reasonably sure\nmethod.",
    "There would have to be conversation.",
    "Much conversation.",
    "For\nin the long run either through a lie or through truth people were\nbound to give themselves away...",
    "He had been introduced by Helen to the gathering and had set to work\nto overcome the almost universal annoyance caused by his presence a foreign stranger  in this family gathering.",
    "He had used his eyes and\nhis ears.",
    "He had watched and listened  openly and behind doors He\nhad noticed affinities antagonisms the unguarded words that arose\nas always when property was to be divided.",
    "He had engineered\nadroitly t\u00eate\u00e0t\u00eates walks upon the terrace and had made his\ndeductions and observations.",
    "He had talked with Miss Gilchrist about\nthe vanished glories of her teashop and about the correct\ncomposition of brioches and chocolate \u00e9clairs and had visited the\nkitchen garden with her to discuss the proper use of herbs in cooking.",
    "He had spent some long halfhours listening to Timothy talking about\nhis own health and about the effect upon it of paint.",
    "Paint Poirot frowned.",
    "Somebody else had said some thing about paint\n Mr Entwhistle\n\nThere had also been discussion of a different kind of painting.",
    "Pierre\nLansquenet as a painter.",
    "Cora Lansquenets paintings rapturised over\nby Miss Gilchrist dismissed scornfully by Susan.",
    "Just like picture\npostcards she had said.",
    "She did them from postcards too.",
    "Miss Gilchrist had been quite upset by that and had said sharply that\ndear Mrs Lansquenet always painted from Nature.",
    "But I bet she cheated said Susan to Poirot when Miss Gilchrist had\ngone out of the room.",
    "In fact I know she did though I wont upset the\nold pussy by saying so.",
    "And how do you know\n\nPoirot watched the strong confident line of Susans chin.",
    "She will always be sure this one he thought.",
    "And perhaps\nsometime she will be too sure...\n\nSusan was going on.",
    "Ill tell you but dont pass it on to the Gilchrist.",
    "One picture is of\nPolflexan the cove and the lighthouse and the pier  the usual aspect\nthat all amateur artists sit down and sketch.",
    "But the pier was blown up\nin the war and since Aunt Coras sketch was done a couple of years\nago it cant very well be from Nature can it But the postcards they\nsell there still show the pier as it used to be.",
    "There was one in her\n\n\fbedroom drawer.",
    "So Aunt Cora started her rough sketch down there\nI expect and then finished it surreptitiously later at home from a\npostcard Its funny isnt it the way people get caught out\n\nYes it is as you say funny.",
    "He paused and then thought that the\nopening was a good one.",
    "You do not remember me Madame he said but I remember you.",
    "This is not the first time that I have seen you.",
    "She stared at him.",
    "Poirot nodded with great gusto.",
    "Yes yes it is so.",
    "I was inside an automobile well wrapped up and\nfrom the window I saw you.",
    "You were talking to one of the mechanics\nin the garage.",
    "You do not notice me  it is natural I am inside the car an elderly muffledup foreigner But I notice you for you are young and\nagreeable to look at and you stand there in the sun.",
    "So when I arrive\nhere I say to myself Tiens what a coincidence\n\nA garage Where When was this\n\nOh a little time ago  a week  no more.",
    "For the moment said Poirot\ndisingenuously and with a full recollection of the Kings Arms garage in\nhis mind I cannot remember where.",
    "I travel so much all over this\ncountry.",
    "Looking for a suitable house to buy for your refugees\n\nYes.",
    "There is so much to take into consideration you see.",
    "Price neighbourhood  suitability for conversion.",
    "I suppose youll have to pull the house about a lot Lots of horrible\npartitions.",
    "In the bedrooms yes certainly.",
    "But most of the ground floor rooms\nwe shall not touch.",
    "He paused before going on.",
    "Does it sadden you\nMadame that this old family mansion of yours should go this way  to\nstrangers\n\nOf course not.",
    "Susan looked amused.",
    "I think its an excellent idea.",
    "Its an impossible place for anybody to think of living in as it is.",
    "And Ive\nnothing to be sentimental about.",
    "Its not my old home.",
    "My mother and\nfather lived in London.",
    "We just came here for Christmas sometimes.",
    "Actually Ive always thought it quite hideous  an almost indecent\ntemple to wealth.",
    "The altars are different now.",
    "There is the building in and the\nconcealed lighting and the expensive simplicity.",
    "But wealth still has its\ntemples Madame.",
    "I understand  I am not I hope indiscreet  that you\nyourself are planning such an edifice Everything de luxe  and no\nexpense spared.",
    "Susan laughed.",
    "Hardly a temple  its just a place of business.",
    "Perhaps the name does not matter...",
    "But it will cost much money  that\nis true is it not\n\n\fEverythings wickedly expensive nowadays.",
    "But the initial outlay will\nbe worth while I think.",
    "Tell me something about these plans of yours.",
    "It amazes me to find a\nbeautiful young woman so practical so competent.",
    "In my young days a long time ago I admit  beautiful women thought only of their\npleasures of cosmetics of la toilette.",
    "Women still think a great deal about their faces  thats where I come\nin.",
    "Tell me.",
    "And she had told him.",
    "Told him with a wealth of detail and with a great\ndeal of unconscious selfrevelation.",
    "He appreciated her business\nacumen her boldness of planning and her grasp of detail.",
    "A good bold\nplanner sweeping all side issues away.",
    "Perhaps a little ruthless as all\nthose who plan boldly must be...",
    "Watching her he had said\n\nYes you will succeed.",
    "You will go ahead.",
    "How fortunate that you are\nnot restricted as so many are by poverty.",
    "One cannot go far without\nthe capital outlay.",
    "To have had these creative ideas and to have been\nfrustrated by lack of means  that would have been unbearable.",
    "I couldnt have borne it But Id have raised money somehow or other got someone to back me.",
    "Ah of course.",
    "Your uncle whose house this was was rich.",
    "Even if he\nhad not died he would as you express it have staked you.",
    "Oh no he wouldnt.",
    "Uncle Richard was a bit of a stickinthemud\nwhere women were concerned.",
    "If Id been a man  A quick flash of\nanger swept across her face.",
    "He made me very angry.",
    "I see  yes I see...",
    "The old shouldnt stand in the way of the young.",
    "I  oh I beg your\npardon.",
    "Hercule Poirot laughed easily and twirled his moustache.",
    "I am old yes.",
    "But I do not impede youth.",
    "There is no one who needs to\nwait for my death.",
    "What a horrid idea.",
    "But you are a realist Madame.",
    "Let us admit without more ado that the\nworld is full of the young  or even the middleaged  who wait patiently\nor impatiently for the death of someone whose decease will give them\nif not affluence  then opportunity.",
    "Opportunity Susan said taking a deep breath.",
    "Thats what one\nneeds.",
    "Poirot who had been looking beyond her said gaily\n\n\fAnd here is your husband come to join our little discussion We talk\nMr Banks of opportunity.",
    "Opportunity the golden  opportunity who\nmust be grasped with both hands.",
    "How far in conscience can one go\nLet us hear your views\n\nBut he was not destined to hear the views of Gregory Banks on\nopportunity or on anything else.",
    "In fact he had found it next to\nimpossible to talk to Gregory Banks at all.",
    "Banks had a curious fluid\nquality.",
    "Whether by his own wish or by that of his wife he seemed to\nhave no liking for t\u00eate\u00e0t\u00eates or quiet discussions.",
    "No conversation\nwith Gregory had failed.",
    "Poirot had talked with Maude Abernethie  also about paint the smell\nof and how fortunate it had been that Timothy had been able to come\nto Enderby and how kind it had been of Helen to extend an invitation to\nMiss Gilchrist also.",
    "For really she is most useful.",
    "Timothy so often feels like a snack  and\none cannot ask too much of other peoples servants but there is a gas\nring in a little room off the pantry so that Miss Gilchrist can warm up\nOvaltine or Bengers there without disturbing anybody.",
    "And shes so\nwilling about fetching things shes quite willing to run up and down\nstairs a dozen times a day.",
    "Oh yes I feel that it was really quite\nprovidential that she should have lost her nerve about staying alone in\nthe house as she did though I admit it vexed me at the time.",
    "Lost her nerve Poirot was interested.",
    "He listened whilst Maude gave him an account of Miss Gilchrists\nsudden collapse.",
    "She was frightened you say And yet could not exactly say why That\nis interesting.",
    "Very interesting.",
    "I put it down myself to delayed shock.",
    "Perhaps.",
    "Once during the war when a bomb dropped about a mile away from\nus I remember Timothy \n\nPoirot abstracted his mind from Timothy.",
    "Had anything particular happened that day he asked.",
    "On what day Maude looked blank.",
    "The day that Miss Gilchrist was upset.",
    "Oh that  no I dont think so.",
    "It seems to have been coming on ever\nsince she left Lychett St Mary or so she said.",
    "She didnt seem to mind\nwhen she was there.",
    "And the result Poirot thought had been a piece of poisoned wedding\ncake.",
    "Not so very surprising that Miss Gilchrist was frightened after\nthat.",
    "And even when she had removed herself to the peaceful country\nround Stansfield Grange the fear had lingered.",
    "More than lingered.",
    "Grown.",
    "Why grown Surely attending on an exacting hypochondriac\nlike Timothy must be so exhausting that nervous fears would be likely\nto be swallowed up in exasperation\n\n\fBut something in that house had made Miss Gilchrist afraid.",
    "What Did\nshe know herself\n\nFinding himself alone with Miss Gilchrist for a brief space before\ndinner Poirot had sailed into the subject with an exaggerated foreign\ncuriosity.",
    "Impossible you comprehend for me to mention the matter of murder\nto members of the family.",
    "But I am intrigued.",
    "Who would not be A\nbrutal crime  a sensitive artist attacked in a lonely cottage.",
    "Terrible\nfor her family.",
    "But terrible also I imagine for you.",
    "Since Mrs Timothy\nAbernethie gives me to understand that you were there at the time\n\nYes I was.",
    "And if youll excuse me M. Pontarlier I dont want to talk\nabout it.",
    "I understand  oh yes I completely understand.",
    "Having said this Poirot waited.",
    "And as he had thought Miss Gilchrist\nimmediately did begin to talk about it.",
    "He heard nothing from her that he had not heard before but he played\nhis part with perfect sympathy uttering little cries of comprehension\nand listening with an absorbed interest which Miss Gilchrist could not\nbut help enjoy.",
    "Not until she had exhausted the subject of what she herself had felt\nand what the doctor had said and how kind Mr Entwhistle had been\ndid Poirot proceed cautiously to the next point.",
    "You were wise I think not to remain alone down in that cottage.",
    "I couldnt have done it M. Pontarlier.",
    "I really couldnt have done it.",
    "No.",
    "I understand even that you were afraid to remain alone in the\nhouse of Mr Timothy Abernethie whilst they came here\n\nMiss Gilchrist looked guilty.",
    "Im terribly ashamed about that.",
    "So foolish really.",
    "It was just a kind of\npanic I had  I really dont know why.",
    "But of course one knows why.",
    "You had just recovered from a\ndastardly attempt to poison you \n\nMiss Gilchrist here sighed and said she simply couldnt understand it.",
    "Why should anyone try to poison her\n\nBut obviously my dear lady because this criminal this assassin\nthought that you knew something that might lead to his apprehension\nby the police.",
    "But what could I know Some dreadful tramp or semicrazed\ncreature.",
    "If it was a tramp.",
    "It seems to me unlikely \n\nOh please M. Pontarlier  Miss Gilchrist became suddenly very\nupset.",
    "Dont suggest such things.",
    "I dont want to believe it.",
    "You do not want to believe what\n\nI dont want to believe that it wasnt  I mean  that it was \n\nShe paused confused.",
    "And yet said Poirot shrewdly you do believe.",
    "Oh I dont.",
    "I dont\n\nBut I think you do.",
    "That is why you are frightened... You are still\nfrightened are you not\n\nOh no not since I came here.",
    "So many people.",
    "And such a nice family\natmosphere.",
    "Oh no everything seems quite all right here.",
    "It seems to me  you must excuse my interest  I am an old man\nsomewhat infirm and a great part of my time is given to idle\nspeculation on matters which interest me  it seems to me that there\nmust have been some definite occurrence at Stansfield Grange which\nso to speak brought your fears to a head.",
    "Doctors recognise\nnowadays how much takes place in our subconscious.",
    "Yes yes  I know they say so.",
    "And I think your subconscious fears might have been brought to a\npoint by some small concrete happening something perhaps quite\nextraneous serving shall we say as a focal point.",
    "Miss Gilchrist seemed to lap this up eagerly.",
    "Im sure you are right she said.",
    "Now\n\nwhat\n\nshould\n\nyou\n\nthink\n\nwas\n\nthis\n\n\n\ner\n\n\n\nextraneous\n\ncircumstance\n\nMiss Gilchrist pondered a moment and then said unexpectedly\n\nI think you know M. Pontarlier it was the nun.",
    "Before Poirot could take this up Susan and her husband came in\nclosely followed by Helen.",
    "A nun thought Poirot... Now where in all this have I heard\nsomething about a nun\n\nHe resolved to lead the conversation on to nuns sometime in the\ncourse of the evening.",
    "Chapter 19\n\nThe family had all been polite to M. Pontarlier the representative of\nUNARCO And how right he had been to have chosen to designate\nhimself by initials.",
    "Everyone had accepted UNARCO as a matter of\ncourse  had even pretended to know all about it How averse human\nbeings were ever to admit ignorance An exception had been\nRosamund who had asked him wonderingly But what is it I never\nheard of it Fortunately no one else had been there at the time.",
    "Poirot\nhad explained the organisation in such a way that anyone but\n\n\fRosamund would have felt abashed at having displayed ignorance of\nsuch a wellknown worldwide institution.",
    "Rosamund however had\nonly said vaguely Oh refugees all over again.",
    "Im so tired of\nrefugees.",
    "Thus voicing the unspoken reaction of many who were\nusually too conventional to express themselves so frankly.",
    "M. Pontarlier was therefore now accepted  as a nuisance but also as\na nonentity.",
    "He had become as it were a piece of foreign d\u00e9cor.",
    "The\ngeneral opinion was that Helen should have avoided having him here\nthis particular weekend but as he was here they must make the best\nof it.",
    "Fortunately this queer little foreigner did not seem to know much\nEnglish.",
    "Quite often he did not understand what you said to him and\nwhen everyone was speaking more or less at once he seemed\ncompletely at sea.",
    "He appeared to be interested only in refugees and\npostwar conditions and his vocabulary only included those subjects.",
    "Ordinary chitchat appeared to bewilder him.",
    "More or less forgotten by\nall Hercule Poirot leant back in his chair sipped his coffee and\nobserved as a cat may observe the twitterings and comings and\ngoings of a flock of birds.",
    "The cat is not ready yet to make its spring.",
    "After twentyfour hours of prowling round the house and examining its\ncontents the heirs of Richard Abernethie were ready to state their\npreferences and if need be to fight for them.",
    "The subject of conversation was first a certain Spode dinner dessert\nservice off which they had just been eating dessert.",
    "I dont suppose I have long to live said Timothy in a faint melancholy\nvoice.",
    "And Maude and I have no children.",
    "It is hardly worth while our\nburdening ourselves with useless possessions.",
    "But for sentiments\n\n\fsake I should like to have the old dessert service.",
    "I remember it in the\ndear old days.",
    "Its out of fashion of course and I understand dessert\nservices have very little value nowadays  but there it is.",
    "I shall be quite\ncontent with that  and perhaps the Boule Cabinet in the White\nBoudoir.",
    "Youre too late Uncle George spoke with debonair insouciance.",
    "I\nasked Helen to mark off the Spode service to me this morning.",
    "Timothy became purple in the face.",
    "Mark it off  mark it off What do you mean Nothings been settled\nyet.",
    "And what do you want with a dessert service.",
    "Youre not married.",
    "As a matter of fact I collect Spode.",
    "And this is really a splendid\nspecimen.",
    "But its quite all right about the Boule Cabinet Uncle.",
    "I\nwouldnt have that as a gift.",
    "Timothy waved aside the Boule Cabinet.",
    "Now look here young George.",
    "You cant go butting in in this way.",
    "Im\nan older man than you are  and Im Richards only surviving brother.",
    "That dessert service is mine.",
    "Why not take the Dresden service Uncle A very fine example and Im\nsure just as full of sentimental memories.",
    "Anyway the Spodes mine.",
    "First come first served.",
    "Nonsense  nothing of the kind Timothy spluttered.",
    "Maude said sharply\n\nPlease dont upset your uncle George.",
    "Its very bad for him.",
    "Naturally\nhe will take the Spode if he wants to The first choice is his and you\nyoung people must come afterwards.",
    "He was Richards brother as he\nsays and you are only a nephew.",
    "And I can tell you this young man.",
    "Timothy was seething with fury.",
    "If Richard had made a proper will the disposal of the contents of this\nplace would have been entirely in my hands.",
    "Thats the way the\nproperty should have been left and if it wasnt I can only suspect\nundue influence.",
    "Yes  and I repeat it  undue influence.",
    "Timothy glared at his nephew.",
    "A preposterous will he said.",
    "Preposterous\n\nHe leant back placed a hand to his heart and groaned\n\nThis is very bad for me.",
    "If I could have  a little brandy.",
    "Miss Gilchrist hurried to get it and returned with the restorative in a\nsmall glass.",
    "Here you are Mr Abernethie.",
    "Please  please dont excite yourself.",
    "Are you sure you oughtnt to go up to bed\n\nDont be a fool.",
    "Timothy swallowed the brandy.",
    "Go to bed I intend\nto protect my interests.",
    "Really George Im surprised at you said Maude.",
    "What your uncle\nsays is perfectly true.",
    "His wishes come first.",
    "If he wants the Spode\ndessert service he shall have it\n\nIts quite hideous anyway said Susan.",
    "Hold your tongue Susan said Timothy.",
    "The thin young man who sat beside Susan raised his head.",
    "In a voice\nthat was a little shriller than his ordinary tones he said\n\nDont speak like that to my wife\n\nHe half rose from his seat.",
    "Susan said quickly Its all right Greg.",
    "I dont mind.",
    "But I do.",
    "Helen said I think it would be graceful on your part George to let\nyour uncle have the dessert service.",
    "Timothy spluttered indignantly  Theres no letting about it\n\nBut George with a slight bow to Helen said Your wish is law Aunt\nHelen.",
    "I abandon my claim.",
    "You didnt really want it anyway did you said Helen.",
    "He cast a sharp glance at her then grinned\n\n\fThe trouble with you Aunt Helen is that youre too sharp by half You\nsee more than youre meant to see.",
    "Dont worry Uncle Timothy the\nSpode is yours.",
    "Just my idea of fun.",
    "Fun indeed.",
    "Maude Abernethie was indignant.",
    "Your uncle might\nhave had a heart attack\n\nDont you believe it said George cheerfully.",
    "Uncle Timothy will\nprobably outlive us all.",
    "Hes what is known as a creaking gate.",
    "Timothy leaned forward balefully.",
    "I dont wonder he said that Richard was disappointed in you.",
    "Whats that The good humour went out of Georges face.",
    "You came up here after Mortimer died expecting to step into his\nshoes  expecting that Richard would make you his heir didnt you\nBut my poor brother soon took your measure.",
    "He knew where the\nmoney would go if you had control of it.",
    "Im surprised that he even left\nyou a part of his fortune.",
    "He knew where it would go.",
    "Horses\nGambling\n\nMonte\n\nCarlo foreign\n\nCasinos.",
    "Perhaps worse.",
    "suspected you of not being straight didnt he\n\nGeorge a white dint appearing each side of his nose said quietly\n\nHadnt you better be careful of what you are saying\n\nHe\n\n\fI wasnt well enough to come here for the funeral said Timothy\nslowly but Maude told me what Cora said.",
    "Cora always was a fool but there may have been something in it.",
    "And if so I know who Id\nsuspect \n\nTimothy Maude stood up solid calm a tower of forcefulness.",
    "You\nhave had a very trying evening.",
    "You must consider your health.",
    "I cant\nhave you getting ill again.",
    "Come up with me.",
    "You must take a sedative\nand go straight to bed.",
    "Timothy and I Helen will take the Spode\ndessert service and the Boule Cabinet as momentoes of Richard.",
    "There is no objection to that I hope\n\nHer glance swept round the company.",
    "Nobody spoke and she\nmarched out of the room supporting Timothy with a hand under his\nelbow waving aside Miss Gilchrist who was hovering halfheartedly by\nthe door.",
    "George broke the silence after they had departed.",
    "Femme formidable he said.",
    "That describes Aunt Maude exactly.",
    "I\nshould hate ever to impede her triumphal progress.",
    "Miss Gilchrist sat down again rather uncomfortably and murmured\n\nMrs Abernethie is always so kind.",
    "The remark fell rather flat.",
    "Michael Shane laughed suddenly and said You know Im enjoying all\nthis The Voysey Inheritance to the life.",
    "By the way Rosamund and I\nwant that malachite table in the drawingroom.",
    "Oh no cried Susan.",
    "I want that.",
    "Here we go again said George raising his eyes to the ceiling.",
    "Well we neednt get angry about it said Susan.",
    "The reason I want it\nis for my new Beauty shop.",
    "Just a note of colour  and I shall put a\ngreat bouquet of wax flowers on it.",
    "It would look wonderful.",
    "I can find\nwax flowers easily enough but a green malachite table isnt so\ncommon.",
    "But darling said Rosamund thats just why we want it.",
    "For the new\nset.",
    "As you say a note of colour  and so absolutely period.",
    "And either\nwax flowers or stuffed humming birds.",
    "It will be absolutely right.",
    "I see what you mean Rosamund said Susan.",
    "But I dont think\nyouve got as good a case as I have.",
    "You could easily have a painted\nmalachite table for the stage  it would look just the same.",
    "But for my\nsalon Ive got to have the genuine thing.",
    "Now ladies said George.",
    "What about a sporting decision Why not\ntoss for it Or cut the cards All quite in keeping with the period of the\ntable.",
    "Susan smiled pleasantly.",
    "Rosamund and I will talk about it tomorrow she said.",
    "She seemed as usual quite sure of herself.",
    "George looked with some\ninterest from her face to that of Rosamund.",
    "Rosamunds face had a\nvague rather faraway expression.",
    "Which one will you back Aunt Helen he asked.",
    "An even money\nchance Id say.",
    "Susan has determination but Rosamund is so\nwonderfully singleminded.",
    "Or perhaps not humming birds said Rosamund.",
    "One of those big\nChinese vases would make a lovely lamp with a gold shade.",
    "Miss Gilchrist hurried into placating speech.",
    "This house is full of so many beautiful things she said.",
    "That green\ntable would look wonderful in your new establishment Im sure Mrs\nBanks.",
    "Ive never seen one like it.",
    "It must be worth a lot of money.",
    "It will be deducted from my share of the estate of course said\nSusan.",
    "Im so sorry  I didnt mean  Miss Gilchrist was covered with\nconfusion.",
    "It may be deducted from our share of the estate Michael pointed\nout.",
    "With the wax flowers thrown in.",
    "They look so right on that table Miss Gilchrist murmured.",
    "Really\nartistic.",
    "Sweetly pretty.",
    "But nobody was paying any attention to Miss Gilchrists wellmeant\ntrivialities.",
    "Greg said speaking again in that high nervous voice\n\nSusan wants that table.",
    "There was a momentary stir of unease as though by his words Greg\nhad set a different musical key.",
    "Helen said quickly\n\nAnd what do you really want George Leaving out the Spode\nservice.",
    "George grinned and the tension relaxed.",
    "Rather a shame to bait old Timothy he said.",
    "But he really is quite\nunbelievable.",
    "Hes had his own way in everything so long that hes\nbecome quite pathological about it.",
    "You have to humour an invalid Mr Crossfield said Miss Gilchrist.",
    "Ruddy old hypochondriac thats what he is said George.",
    "Of course he is Susan agreed.",
    "I dont believe theres anything\nwhatever the matter with him do you Rosamund\n\nWhat\n\n\fAnything the matter with Uncle Timothy.",
    "No  no I shouldnt think so.",
    "Rosamund was vague.",
    "She apologised.",
    "Im sorry.",
    "I was thinking about what lighting would be right for the\ntable.",
    "You see said George.",
    "A woman of one idea.",
    "Your wifes a\ndangerous woman Michael.",
    "I hope you realise it.",
    "I realise it said Michael rather grimly.",
    "George went on with every appearance of enjoyment.",
    "The Battle of the Table To be fought tomorrow  politely  but with\ngrim determination We ought all to take sides.",
    "I back Rosamund who\nlooks so sweet and yielding and isnt.",
    "Husbands presumably back\ntheir own wives.",
    "Miss Gilchrist On Susans side obviously.",
    "Oh really Mr Crossfield I wouldnt venture to \n\nAunt Helen George paid no attention to Miss Gilchrists flutterings.",
    "You have the casting vote.",
    "Oh er  I forgot.",
    "M. Pontarlier\n\nPardon Hercule Poirot looked blank.",
    "George considered explanations but decided against it.",
    "The poor old\nboy hadnt understood a word of what was going on.",
    "He said Just a\nfamily joke.",
    "Yes yes I comprehend.",
    "Poirot smiled amiably.",
    "So yours is the casting vote Aunt Helen.",
    "Whose side are you on\n\nHelen smiled.",
    "Perhaps I want it myself George.",
    "She changed the subject deliberately turning to her foreign guest.",
    "Im afraid this is all very dull for you M. Pontarlier\n\nNot at all Madame.",
    "I consider myself privileged to be admitted to your\nfamily life  he bowed.",
    "I would like to say  I cannot quite express my\nmeaning  my regret that this house had to pass out of your hands into\nthe hands of strangers.",
    "It is without doubt  a great sorrow.",
    "No indeed we dont regret at all Susan assured him.",
    "You are very amiable Madame.",
    "It will be let me tell you perfection\nhere for my elderly sufferers of persecution.",
    "What a haven What\npeace I beg you to remember that when the harsh feelings come to\nyou as assuredly they must.",
    "I hear that there was also the question of a\nschool coming here  not a regular school a convent  run by\nreligieuses  by nuns I think you say You would have preferred that\nperhaps\n\nNot at all said George.",
    "The Sacred Heart of Mary continued Poirot.",
    "Fortunately owing to\nthe kindness of an unknown benefactor we were able to make a\n\n\fslightly higher offer.",
    "He addressed Miss Gilchrist directly.",
    "You do not\nlike nuns I think\n\nMiss Gilchrist flushed and looked embarrassed.",
    "Oh really Mr Pontarlier you mustnt  I mean its nothing personal.",
    "But I never do see that its right to shut yourself up from the world in\nthat way  not necessary I mean and really almost selfish though not\nteaching ones of course or the ones that go about amongst the poor because Im sure theyre thoroughly unselfish women and do a lot of\ngood.",
    "I simply cant imagine wanting to be a nun said Susan.",
    "Its very becoming said Rosamund.",
    "You remember  when they\nrevived The Miracle last year.",
    "Sonia Wells looked absolutely too\nglamorous for words.",
    "What beats me said George is why it should be pleasing to the\nAlmighty to dress oneself up in medieval dress.",
    "For after all thats all a\nnuns dress is.",
    "Thoroughly cumbersome unhygienic and impractical.",
    "And it makes them look so alike doesnt it said Miss Gilchrist.",
    "Its\nsilly you know but I got quite a turn when I was at Mrs Abernethies\nand a nun came to the door collecting.",
    "I got it into my head she was\nthe same as a nun who came to the door on the day of the inquest on\npoor Mrs Lansquenet at Lychett St Mary.",
    "I felt you know almost as\nthough she had been following me round\n\n\fI thought nuns always collected in couples said George.",
    "Surely a\ndetective story hinged on that point once\n\nThere was only one this time said Miss Gilchrist.",
    "Perhaps theyve\ngot to economise she added vaguely.",
    "And anyway it couldnt have\nbeen the same nun for the other one was collecting for an organ for St\n Barnabas I think  and this one was for something quite different some thing to do with children.",
    "But they both had the same type of features Hercule Poirot asked.",
    "He sounded interested.",
    "Miss Gilchrist turned to him.",
    "I suppose that must be it.",
    "The upper lip  almost as though she had a\nmoustache.",
    "I think you know that that is really what alarmed me being in a rather nervous state at the time and remembering those\nstories during the war of nuns who were really men and in the Fifth\nColumn and landed by parachute.",
    "Of course it was very foolish of me.",
    "I\nknew that afterwards.",
    "A nun would be a good disguise said Susan thoughtfully.",
    "It hides\nyour feet.",
    "The truth is said George that one very seldom looks properly at\nanyone.",
    "Thats why one gets such wildly differing accounts of a person\nfrom different witnesses in court.",
    "Youd be surprised.",
    "A man is often\ndescribed as tall  short thin  stout fair  dark dressed in a dark  light\n suit and so on.",
    "Theres usually one reliable observer but one has to\nmake up ones mind who that is.",
    "Another queer thing said Susan is that you sometimes catch sight\nof yourself in a mirror unexpectedly and dont know who it is.",
    "It just\nlooks vaguely familiar.",
    "And you say to yourself That s somebody I\nknow quite well and then suddenly realise its yourself\n\nGeorge said It would be more difficult still if you could really see\nyourself  and not a mirror image.",
    "Why asked Rosamund looking puzzled.",
    "Because dont you see nobody ever sees themselves  as they\nappear to other people.",
    "They always see themselves in a glass  that is\n as a reversed image.",
    "But does that look any different\n\nOh yes said Susan quickly.",
    "It must.",
    "Because peoples faces aren t\nthe same both sides.",
    "Their eyebrows are different and their mouths go\nup one side and their noses arent really straight.",
    "You can see with a\npencil  whos got a pencil\n\nSomebody produced a pencil and they experimented holding a pencil\neach side of the nose and laughing to see the ridiculous variation in\nangle.",
    "The atmosphere now had lightened a good deal.",
    "Everybody was in a\ngood humour.",
    "They were no longer the heirs of Richard Abernethie\ngathered together for a division of property.",
    "They were a cheerful and\nnormal set of people gathered together for a weekend in the country.",
    "Only Helen Abernethie remained silent and abstracted.",
    "With a sigh Hercule Poirot rose to his feet and bade his hostess a\npolite good night.",
    "And perhaps Madame I had better say goodbye.",
    "My train departs\nitself at nine oclock tomorrow morning.",
    "That is very early.",
    "So I will\nthank you now for all your kindness and hospitality.",
    "The date of\npossession  that will be arranged with the good Mr Entwhistle.",
    "To suit\nyour convenience of course.",
    "It can be any time you please M. Pontarlier.",
    "I  I have finished all that I\ncame here to do.",
    "You will return now to your villa at Cyprus\n\nYes.",
    "A little smile curved Helen Abernethies lips.",
    "Poirot said\n\nYou are glad yes.",
    "You have no regrets\n\nAt leaving England Or leaving here do you mean\n\nI meant  leaving here\n\nNo  no.",
    "Its no good is it to cling on to the past One must leave that\nbehind one.",
    "If one can.",
    "Blinking his eyes innocently Poirot smiled apologetically\nround on the group of polite faces that surrounded him.",
    "Sometimes is it not the Past will not be left will not suffer itself to\npass into oblivion It stands at ones elbow  it says I am not done with\nyet.",
    "Susan gave a rather doubtful laugh.",
    "Poirot said\n\nBut I am serious  yes.",
    "You mean said Michael that your refugees when they come here\nwill not be able to put their past sufferings completely behind them\n\nI did not mean my Refugees.",
    "He meant us darling said Rosamund.",
    "He means Uncle Richard and\nAunt Cora and the hatchet and all that.",
    "She turned to Poirot.",
    "Didnt you\n\nPoirot looked at her with a blank face.",
    "Then he said\n\nWhy do you think that Madame\n\nBecause youre a detective arent you Thats why youre here.",
    "NARCO or whatever you call it is just nonsense isnt it\n\n\fChapter 20\n\nThere was a moment of extraordinary tenseness.",
    "Poirot felt it though\nhe himself did not remove his eyes from Rosamunds lovely placid\nface.",
    "He said with a little bow You have great perspicacity Madame.",
    "Not really said Rosamund.",
    "You were pointed out to me once in a\nrestaurant.",
    "I remembered.",
    "But you have not mentioned it  until now\n\nI thought it would be more fun not to said Rosamund\n\nMichael said in an imperfectly controlled voice\n\nMy  dear girl.",
    "Poirot shifted his gaze then to look at him.",
    "Michael was angry.",
    "Angry and something else  apprehensive\n\nPoirots eyes went slowly round all the faces.",
    "Susans angry and\nwatchful Gregorys dead and shut in Miss Gilchrists foolish her\nmouth wide open George wary Helen dismayed and nervous...\n\nAll those expressions were normal ones under the circumstances.",
    "He\nwished he could have seen their faces a split second earlier when the\n\n\fwords a detective fell from Rosamunds lips.",
    "For now inevitably it\ncould not be quite the same...",
    "He squared his shoulders and bowed to them.",
    "His language and his\naccent became less foreign.",
    "Yes he said.",
    "I am a detective.",
    "George Crossfield said the white dints showing once more each side\nof his nose Who sent you here\n\nI was commissioned to inquire into the circumstances of Richard\nAbernethies death.",
    "By whom\n\nFor the moment that does not concern you.",
    "But it would be an\nadvantage would it not if you could be assured beyond any possible\ndoubt that Richard Abernethie died a natural death\n\nOf course he died a natural death.",
    "Who says anything else\n\nCora Lansquenet said so.",
    "And Cora Lansquenet is dead herself.",
    "A little wave of uneasiness seemed to sigh through the room like an\nevil breeze.",
    "She said it here  in this room said Susan.",
    "But I didnt really think \n\n\fDidnt you Susan George Crossfield turned his sardonic glance\nupon her.",
    "Why pretend any more You wont take M. Pontarlier in\n\nWe all thought so really said Rosamund.",
    "And his name isnt Pontarlier its Hercules something.",
    "Hercule Poirot  at your service.",
    "Poirot bowed.",
    "There were no gasps of astonishment or of apprehension.",
    "His name\nseemed to mean nothing at all to them.",
    "They were less alarmed by it than they had been by the single word\ndetective.",
    "May I ask what conclusions you have come to asked George.",
    "He wont tell you darling said Rosamund.",
    "Or if he does tell you\nwhat he says wont be true.",
    "Alone of the company she appeared to be amused.",
    "Hercule Poirot looked at her thoughtfully.",
    "II\n\nHercule Poirot did not sleep well that night.",
    "He was perturbed and he\nwas not quite sure why he was perturbed.",
    "Elusive snatches of\n\n\fconversation various glances odd movements  all seemed fraught\nwith a tantalising significance in the loneliness of the night.",
    "He was on\nthe threshold of sleep but sleep would not come.",
    "Just as he was about\nto drop off something flashed into his mind and woke him up again.",
    "Paint  Timothy and paint.",
    "Oil paint  the smell of oil paint  connected\nsomehow with Mr Entwhistle.",
    "Paint and Cora.",
    "Coras paintings picture postcards... Cora was deceitful about her painting... No back\nto Mr Entwhistle  something Mr Entwhistle had said  or was it\nLanscombe A nun who came to the house on the day that Richard\nAbernethie died.",
    "A nun with a moustache.",
    "A nun at Stansfield Grange and at Lytchett St Mary.",
    "Altogether too many nuns Rosamund looking\nglamorous as a nun on the stage.",
    "Rosamund  saying that he was a\ndetective  and everyone staring at her when she said it.",
    "That was the\nway that they must all have stared at Cora that day when she said But\nhe was murdered wasnt he What was it Helen Abernethie had felt to\nbe wrong on that occasion Helen Abernethie  leaving the past\nbehind  going to Cyprus... Helen dropping the wax flowers with a\ncrash when he had said  what was it he had said He couldnt quite\nremember...",
    "He slept then and as he slept he dreamed...",
    "He dreamed of the green malachite table.",
    "On it was the glasscovered\nstand of wax flowers  only the whole thing had been painted over with\nthick crimson oil paint.",
    "Paint the colour of blood.",
    "He could smell the\npaint and Timothy was groaning was saying Im dying  dying... this\nis the end.",
    "And Maude standing by tall and stern with a large knife in\nher hand was echoing him saying Yes its the end...",
    "The end  a\ndeathbed with candles and a nun praying.",
    "If he could just see the\nnuns face he would know...\n\n\fHercule Poirot woke up  and he did know\n\nYes it was the end...",
    "Though there was still a long way to go.",
    "He sorted out the various bits of the mosaic.",
    "Mr Entwhistle the smell of paint Timothys house and something that\nmust be in it  or might be in it... the wax flowers... Helen...",
    "Broken\nglass...\n\nIII\n\nHelen Abernethie in her room took some time in going to bed.",
    "She\nwas thinking.",
    "Sitting in front of her dressingtable she stared at herself unseeingly\nin the glass.",
    "She had been forced into having Hercule Poirot in the house.",
    "She had\nnot wanted it.",
    "But Mr Entwhistle had made it hard for her to refuse.",
    "And now the whole thing had come out into the open.",
    "No question any\nmore of letting Richard Abernethie lie quiet in his grave.",
    "All started by\nthose few words of Coras...\n\nThat day after the funeral... How had they all looked she wondered\nHow had they looked to Cora How had she herself looked\n\n\fWhat was it George had said About seeing oneself\n\nThere was some quotation too.",
    "To see ourselves as others see us... As\nothers see us.",
    "The eyes that were staring into the glass unseeingly suddenly focused.",
    "She was seeing herself  but not really herself  not herself as others\nsaw her  not as Cora had seen her that day.",
    "Her right  no her left eyebrow was arched a little higher than the\nright.",
    "The mouth No the curve of the mouth was symmetrical.",
    "If she\nmet herself she would surely not see much difference from this mirror\nimage.",
    "Not like Cora.",
    "Cora  the picture came quite clearly... Cora on the day of the funeral\nher head tilted sideways  asking her question  looking at Helen...",
    "Suddenly Helen raised her hands to her face.",
    "She said to herself.",
    "It\ndoesnt make sense... it cant make sense....\n\nIV\n\nMiss Entwhistle was aroused from a delightful dream in which she was\nplaying Piquet with Queen Mary by the ringing of the telephone.",
    "She tried to ignore it  but it persisted.",
    "Sleepily she raised her head\nfrom the pillow and looked at the watch beside her bed.",
    "Five minutes\nto seven  who on earth could be ringing up at that hour It must be a\nwrong number.",
    "The irritating dingding continued.",
    "Miss Entwhistle sighed snatched\nup a dressinggown and marched into the sittingroom.",
    "This is Kensington 675498 she said with asperity as she picked up\nthe receiver.",
    "This is Mrs Abernethie speaking.",
    "Mrs Leo Abernethie.",
    "Can I speak to\nMr Entwhistle\n\nOh good morning Mrs Abernethie.",
    "The good morning was not\ncordial.",
    "This is Miss Entwhistle.",
    "My brother is still asleep Im afraid.",
    "I\nwas asleep myself.",
    "Im so sorry Helen was forced to the apology.",
    "But its very\nimportant that I should speak to your brother at once.",
    "Wouldnt it do later\n\nIm afraid not.",
    "Oh very well then.",
    "Miss Entwhistle was tart.",
    "She tapped at her brothers door and went in.",
    "Those Abernethies again she said bitterly.",
    "Eh The Abernethies\n\n\fMrs Leo Abernethie.",
    "Ringing up before seven in the morning Really\n\nMrs Leo is it Dear me.",
    "How remarkable.",
    "Where is my dressinggown Ah thank you.",
    "Presently he was saying\n\nEntwhistle speaking.",
    "Is that you Helen\n\nYes.",
    "Im terribly sorry to get you out of bed like this.",
    "But you did tell\nme once to ring you up at once if I remembered what it was that struck\nme as having been wrong somehow on the day of the funeral when\nCora electrified us all by suggesting that Richard had been murdered.",
    "Ah You have remembered\n\nHelen said in a puzzled voice\n\nYes but it doesnt make sense.",
    "You must allow me to be the judge of that.",
    "Was it something you\nnoticed about one of the people\n\nYes.",
    "Tell me.",
    "It seems absurd.",
    "Helens voice sounded apologetic.",
    "But Im quite\nsure of it.",
    "It came to me when I was looking at myself in the glass last\nnight.",
    "Oh...",
    "The little startled half cry was succeeded by a sound that came oddly\nthrough the wires  a dull heavy sound that Mr Entwhistle couldnt\nplace at all.",
    "He said urgently\n\nHallo  hallo  are you there Helen are you there... Helen...\n\nChapter 21\n\nIt was not until nearly an hour later that Mr Entwhistle after a great\ndeal of conversation with supervisors and others found himself at last\nspeaking to Hercule Poirot.",
    "Thank heaven said Mr Entwhistle with pardonable exasperation.",
    "The Exchange seems to have had the greatest difficulty in getting the\nnumber.",
    "That is not surprising.",
    "The receiver was off the hook.",
    "There was a grim quality in Poirots voice which carried through to the\nlistener.",
    "Mr Entwhistle said sharply\n\nHas something happened\n\n\fYes.",
    "Mrs Leo Abernethie was found by the housemaid about twenty\nminutes ago lying by the telephone in the study.",
    "She was unconscious.",
    "A serious concussion.",
    "Do you mean she was struck on the head\n\nI think so.",
    "It is just possible that she fell and struck her head on a\nmarble doorstop but me I do not think so and the doctor he does not\nthink so either.",
    "She was telephoning to me at the time.",
    "I wondered when we were cut\noff so suddenly.",
    "So it was to you she was telephoning What did she say\n\nShe mentioned to me some time ago that on the occasion when Cora\nLansquenet suggested her brother had been murdered she herself\nhad a feeling of something being wrong  odd  she did not quite know\nhow to put it  unfortunately she could not remember why she had that\nimpression.",
    "And suddenly she did remember\n\nYes.",
    "And rang you up to tell you\n\nYes.",
    "Eh bien\n\n\fTheres no eh bien about it said Mr Entwhistle testily.",
    "She started to\ntell me but was interrupted.",
    "How much had she said\n\nNothing pertinent.",
    "You will excuse me mon ami but I am the judge of that not you.",
    "What\nexactly did she say\n\nShe reminded me that I had asked her to let me know at once if she\nremembered what it was that had struck her as peculiar.",
    "She said she\nhad remembered  but that it didnt make sense.",
    "I asked her if it was something about one of the people who were\nthere that day and she said yes it was.",
    "She said it had come to her\nwhen she was looking in the glass \n\nYes\n\nThat was all.",
    "She gave no hint as to  which of the people concerned it was\n\nI should hardly fail to let you know if she had told me that said Mr\nEntwhistle acidly.",
    "I apologise mon ami.",
    "Of course you would have told me.",
    "Mr Entwhistle said\n\nWe shall just have to wait until she recovers consciousness before we\nknow.",
    "Poirot said gravely\n\nThat may not be for a very long time.",
    "Perhaps never.",
    "Is it as bad as that Mr Entwhistles voice shook a little.",
    "Yes it is as bad as that.",
    "But  thats terrible Poirot.",
    "Yes it is terrible.",
    "And it is why we cannot afford to wait.",
    "For it shows\nthat we have to deal with someone who is either completely ruthless or\nso frightened that it comes to the same thing.",
    "But look here Poirot what about Helen I feel worried.",
    "Are you sure\nshe would be safe at Enderby\n\nNo she would not be safe.",
    "So she is not at Enderby.",
    "Already the\nambulance has come and is taking her to a nursing home where she\nwill have special nurses and where no one family or otherwise will be\nallowed to see her.",
    "Mr Entwhistle sighed.",
    "You relieve my mind She might have been in danger.",
    "She assuredly would have been in danger\n\nM Entwhistles voice sounded deeply moved.",
    "I have a great regard for Helen Abernethie.",
    "I always have had.",
    "A\nwoman of very exceptional character.",
    "She may have had certain  what\nshall I say  reticences in her life.",
    "Ah there were reticences\n\nI have always had an idea that such was the case.",
    "Hence the villa in Cyprus.",
    "Yes that explains a good deal...",
    "I dont want you to begin thinking\n\nYou cannot stop me thinking.",
    "But now there is a little commission\nthat I have for you.",
    "One moment.",
    "There was a pause then Poirots voice spoke again.",
    "I had to make sure that nobody was listening.",
    "All is well.",
    "Now here is\nwhat I want you to do for me.",
    "You must prepare to make a journey.",
    "A journey Mr Entwhistle sounded faintly dismayed Oh I see  you\nwant me to come down to Enderby\n\nNot at all.",
    "I am in charge here.",
    "No you will not have to travel so far.",
    "Your journey will not take you very far from London.",
    "You will travel to\n\n\fBury St Edmunds  Ma foi what names your English towns have and\nthere you will hire a car and drive to Forsdyke House.",
    "It is a Mental\nHome.",
    "Ask for Dr Penrith and inquire of him particulars about a patient\nwho was recently discharged.",
    "What patient Anyway surely \n\nPoirot broke in\n\nThe name of the patient is Gregory Banks.",
    "Find out for what form of\ninsanity he was being treated.",
    "Do you mean that Gregory Banks is insane\n\nSh Be careful what you say.",
    "And now  I have not yet breakfasted and\nyou too I suspect have not breakfasted\n\nNot yet.",
    "I was too anxious \n\nQuite so.",
    "Then I pray you eat your breakfast repose yourself.",
    "There\nis a good train to Bury St Edmunds at twelve oclock.",
    "If I have any more\nnews I will telephone you before you start.",
    "Be careful of yourself Poirot said Mr Entwhistle with some concern.",
    "Ah that yes Me I do not want to be hit on the head with a marble\ndoorstop.",
    "You may be assured that I will take every precaution.",
    "And\nnow  for the moment  goodbye.",
    "Poirot heard the sound of the receiver being replaced at the other end\nthen he heard a very faint second click  and smiled to himself.",
    "Somebody had replaced the receiver on the telephone in the hall.",
    "He went out there.",
    "There was no one about.",
    "He tiptoed to the\ncupboard at the back of the stairs and looked inside.",
    "At that moment\nLanscombe came through the service door carrying a tray with toast\nand a silver coffee pot.",
    "He looked slightly surprised to see Poirot\nemerge from the cupboard.",
    "Breakfast is ready in the diningroom sir he said.",
    "Poirot surveyed him thoughtfully.",
    "The old butler looked white and shaken.",
    "Courage said Poirot clapping him on the shoulder.",
    "All will yet be\nwell.",
    "Would it be too much trouble to serve me a cup of coffee in my\nbedroom\n\nCertainly sir.",
    "I will send Janet up with it sir.",
    "Lanscombe looked disapprovingly at Hercule Poirots back as the\nlatter climbed the stairs.",
    "Poirot was attired in an exotic silk dressinggown with a pattern of triangles and squares.",
    "Foreigners thought Lanscombe bitterly.",
    "Foreigners in the house\nAnd Mrs Leo with concussion I dont know what were coming to.",
    "Nothings the same since Mr Richard died.",
    "Hercule Poirot was dressed by the time he received his coffee from\nJanet.",
    "His murmurs of sympathy were well received since he stressed\nthe shock her discovery must have given her.",
    "Yes indeed sir what I felt when I opened the door of the study and\ncame in with the Hoover and saw Mrs Leo lying there I never shall\nforget.",
    "There she lay  and I made sure she was dead.",
    "She must have\nbeen taken faint as she stood at the phone  and fancy her being up at\nthat time in the morning Ive never known her do such a thing before.",
    "Fancy indeed He added casually No one else was up I suppose\n\nAs it happens sir Mrs Timothy was up and about.",
    "Shes a very early\nriser always  often goes for a walk before breakfast.",
    "She is of the generation that rises early said Poirot nodding his\nhead.",
    "The younger ones now  they do not get up so early\n\nNo indeed sir all fast asleep when I brought them their tea  and\nvery late I was too what with the shock and getting the doctor to\ncome and having to have a cup first to steady myself.",
    "She went off and Poirot reflected on what she had said.",
    "Maude Abernethie had been up and about and the younger generation\nhad been in bed  but that Poirot reflected meant nothing at all.",
    "Anyone could have heard Helens door open and close and have\nfollowed her down to listen  and would afterwards have made a point\nof being fast asleep in bed.",
    "But if I am right thought Poirot.",
    "And after all it is natural to me to\nbe right  it is a habit I have  then there is no need to go into who was\nhere and who was there.",
    "First I must seek a proof where I have\ndeduced the proof may be.",
    "And then  I make my little speech.",
    "And I sit\nback and see what happens...\n\nAs soon as Janet had left the room Poirot drained his coffee cup put\non his overcoat and his hat left his room ran nimbly down the back\nstairs and left the house by the side door.",
    "He walked briskly the\nquartermile to the post office where he demanded a trunk call.",
    "Presently he was once more speaking to Mr Entwhistle.",
    "Yes it is I yet again Pay no attention to the commission with which I\nentrusted you.",
    "C\u00e9tait une blague Someone was listening.",
    "Now mon\nviex to the real commission.",
    "You must as I said take a train.",
    "But not\nto Bury St Edmunds.",
    "I want you to proceed to the house of Mr Timothy\nAbernethie.",
    "But Timothy and Maude are at Enderby.",
    "Exactly.",
    "There is no one in the house but a woman by the name of\nJones who has been persuaded by the offer of considerable largesse\nto guard the house whilst they are absent.",
    "What I want you to do is to\ntake something out of that house\n\nMy dear Poirot I really cant stoop to burglary\n\nIt will not seem like burglary.",
    "You will say to the excellent Mrs Jones\nwho knows you that you have been asked by Mr or Mrs Abernethie to\n\n\ffetch this particular object and take it to London.",
    "She will not suspect\nanything amiss.",
    "No no probably not.",
    "But Idont like it.",
    "Mr Entwhistle sounded most\nreluctant.",
    "Why cant you go and get whatever it is yourself.",
    "Because my friend I should be a stranger of foreign appearance and\nas such a suspicious character and Mrs Jones would at once raise the\ndifficulties With you she will not.",
    "No no  I see that.",
    "But what on earth are Timothy and Maude going to\nthink when they hear about it I have known them for forty odd years.",
    "And you knew Richard Abernethie for that time also And you knew\nCora Lansquenet when she was a little girl\n\nIn a martyred voice Mr Entwhistle asked\n\nYoure sure this is really necessary Poirot\n\nThe old question they asked in the wartime on the posters.",
    "Is your\njourney really necessary I say to you it is necessary.",
    "It is vital\n\nAnd what is this object Ive got to get hold of\n\nPoirot told him.",
    "But really Poirot I dont see \n\nIt is not necessary for you to see.",
    "I am doing the seeing.",
    "And what do you want me to do with the damned thing\n\nYou will take it to London to an address in Elm Park Gardens.",
    "If you\nhave a pencil note it down.",
    "Having done so Mr Entwhistle said still in his martyred voice\n\nI hope you know what you are doing Poirot\n\nHe sounded very doubtful  but Poirots reply was not doubtful at all.",
    "Of course I know what I am doing.",
    "We are nearing the end.",
    "Mr Entwhistle sighed\n\nIf we could only guess what Helen was going to tell me.",
    "No need to guess.",
    "I know.",
    "You know But my dear Poirot \n\nExplanations must wait.",
    "But let me assure you of this.",
    "I know what\nHelen Abernethie saw when she looked in her mirror.",
    "II\n\nBreakfast had been an uneasy meal.",
    "Neither Rosamund nor Timothy\nhad appeared but the others were there and had talked in rather\n\n\fsubdued tones and eaten a little less than they normally would have\ndone.",
    "George was the first one to recover his spirits.",
    "His temperament was\nmercurial and optimistic.",
    "I expect Aunt Helen will be all right he said.",
    "Doctors always like to\npull a long face.",
    "After all whats concussion Often clears up\ncompletely in a couple of days.",
    "A woman I knew had concussion during the war said Miss Gilchrist\nconversationally.",
    "A brick or something hit her as she was walking\ndown Tottenham Court Road  it was during fly bomb time  and she\nnever felt anything at all.",
    "Just went on with what she was doing  and\ncollapsed in a tram to Liverpool twelve hours later.",
    "And would you\nbelieve it she had no recollection at all of going to the station and\ncatching the train or anything.",
    "She just couldnt understand it when\nshe woke up in hospital.",
    "She was there for nearly three weeks.",
    "What I cant make out said Susan is what Helen was doing\ntelephoning at that unearthly hour and who she was telephoning to\n\nFelt ill said Maude with decision.",
    "Probably woke up feeling queer\nand came down to ring up the doctor.",
    "Then had a giddy fit and fell.",
    "Thats the only thing that makes sense.",
    "Bad luck hitting her head on that doorstop said Michael.",
    "If shed\njust pitched over on to that thick pile carpet shed have been all right.",
    "The door opened and Rosamund came in frowning.",
    "I cant find those wax flowers she said.",
    "I mean the ones that were\nstanding on the malachite table the day of Uncle Richards funeral.",
    "She looked accusingly at Susan.",
    "You havent taken them\n\nOf course I havent Really Rosamund youre not still thinking about\nmalachite tables with poor old Helen carted off to hospital with\nconcussion\n\nI dont see why I shouldnt think about them.",
    "If youve got concussion\nyou dont know whats happening and it doesnt matter to you.",
    "We cant\ndo anything for Aunt Helen and Michael and I have got to get back to\nLondon by tomorrow lunchtime because were seeing Jackie Lygo\nabout opening dates for The Baronets Progress.",
    "So Id like to fix up\ndefinitely about the table.",
    "But Id like to have a look at those wax\nflowers again.",
    "Theres a kind of Chinese vase on the table now  nice but not nearly so period.",
    "I do wonder where they are  perhaps\nLanscombe knows.",
    "Lanscombe had just looked in to see if they had finished breakfast.",
    "Were all through Lanscombe said George getting up.",
    "Whats\nhappened to our foreign friend\n\nHe is having his coffee and toast served upstairs sir.",
    "Petit dejeuner for NARCO.",
    "Lanscombe do you know where those wax flowers are that used to\nbe on that green table in the drawingroom asked Rosamund.",
    "I understand Mrs Leo had an accident with them maam.",
    "She was\ngoing to have a new glass shade made but I dont think she has seen\nabout it yet.",
    "Then where is the thing\n\nIt would probably be in the cupboard behind the staircase maam.",
    "That is where things are usually placed when awaiting repair.",
    "Shall I\nascertain for you\n\nIll go and look myself.",
    "Come with me Michael sweetie.",
    "Its dark there\nand Im not going in any dark corners by myself after what happened\nto Aunt Helen.",
    "Everybody showed a sharp reaction.",
    "Maude demanded in her deep\nvoice\n\nWhat do you mean Rosamund\n\nWell she was coshed by someone wasnt she\n\nGregory Banks said sharply\n\nShe was taken suddenly faint and fell.",
    "Rosamund laughed.",
    "Did she tell you so Dont be silly Greg of course she was coshed.",
    "George said sharply\n\nYou shouldnt say things like that Rosamund.",
    "Nonsense said Rosamund.",
    "She must have been.",
    "I mean it all adds\nup.",
    "A detective in the house looking for clues and Uncle Richard\npoisoned and Aunt Cora killed with a hatchet and Miss Gilchrist given\npoisoned wedding cake and now Aunt Helen struck down with a blunt\ninstrument.",
    "Youll see it will go on like that.",
    "One after another of us will\nbe killed and the one thats left will be It  the murderer I mean.",
    "But its\nnot going to be me  whos killed I mean.",
    "And why should anyone want to kill you beautiful Rosamund asked\nGeorge lightly.",
    "Rosamund opened her eyes very wide.",
    "Oh she said.",
    "Because I know too much of course.",
    "What do you know Maude Abernethie and Gregory Banks spoke\nalmost in unison.",
    "Rosamund gave her vacant and angelic smile.",
    "Wouldnt you all like to know she said agreeably.",
    "Come on\nMichael.",
    "Chapter 22\n\n\fAt eleven oclock Hercule Poirot called an informal meeting in the\nlibrary.",
    "Everyone was there and Poirot looked thoughtfully round the\nsemicircle of faces.",
    "Last night he said Mrs Shane announced to you that I was a private\ndetective.",
    "For myself I hoped to retain my  camouflage shall we say\n a little longer.",
    "But no matter Today  or at most the day after  I would\nhave told you the truth.",
    "Please listen carefully now to what I have to\nsay.",
    "I am in my own line a celebrated person  I may say a most celebrated\nperson.",
    "My gifts in fact are unequalled\n\nGeorge Crossfield grinned and said\n\nThats the stuff M. Pont  no its M. Poirot isnt it Funny isnt it that\nIve never even heard of you\n\nIt is not funny said Poirot severely.",
    "It is lamentable Alas there is\nno proper education nowadays.",
    "Apparently one learns nothing but\neconomics  and how to set Intelligence Tests But to continue.",
    "I have\nbeen a friend for many years of Mr Entwhistles \n\nSo hes the nigger in the wood pile \n\nIf you like to put it that way Mr Crossfield.",
    "Mr Entwhistle was greatly\nupset by the death of his old friend Mr Richard Abernethie.",
    "He was\nparticularly perturbed by some words spoken on the day of the funeral\nby Mr Abernethies sister Mrs Lansquenet.",
    "Words spoken in this very\nroom.",
    "Very silly  and just like Cora said Maude.",
    "Mr Entwhistle should\nhave had more sense than to pay attention to them\n\nPoirot went on\n\nMr Entwhistle was even more perturbed after the  the coincidence\nshall I say  of Mrs Lansquenets death.",
    "He wanted one thing only  to\nbe assured that that death was a coincidence.",
    "In other words he\nwanted to feel assured that Richard Abernethie had died a natural\ndeath.",
    "To that end he commissioned me to make the necessary\ninvestigations.",
    "There was a pause.",
    "I have made them...\n\nAgain there was a pause.",
    "No one spoke.",
    "Poirot threw back his head.",
    "Eh bien you will all be delighted to hear that as a result of my\ninvestigations there is absolutely no reason to believe that Mr\nAbernethie died anything but a natural death.",
    "There is no reason at all\nto believe that he was murdered He smiled.",
    "He threw out his hands in\na triumphant gesture.",
    "That is good news is it not\n\nIt hardly seemed to be by the way they took it.",
    "They stared at him and\nin all but the eyes of one person there still seemed to be doubt and\nsuspicion.",
    "The exception was Timothy Abernethie who was nodding his head in\nviolent agreement.",
    "Of course Richard wasnt murdered he said angrily.",
    "Never could\nunderstand why anybody even thought of such a thing for a moment\nJust Cora up to her tricks that was all.",
    "Wanting to give you all a scare.",
    "Her idea of being funny.",
    "Truth is that although she was my own sister\nshe was always a bit mental poor girl.",
    "Well Mr whatever your name is\nIm glad youve had the sense to come to the right conclusion though if\nyou ask me I call it damned cheek of Entwhistle to go commissioning\nyou to come prying and poking about.",
    "And if he thinks hes going to\ncharge the estte with your fee I can tell you he wont get away with it\nDamned cheek and most uncalled for Whos Entwhistle to set himself\nup If the familys satisfied \n\nBut the family wasnt Uncle Timothy said Rosamund.",
    "Hey  whats that\n\nTimothy peered at her under beetling brows of displeasure.",
    "We werent satisfied.",
    "And what about Aunt Helen this morning\n\nMaude said sharply\n\nHelens just the age when youre liable to get a stroke.",
    "Thats all there\nis to that.",
    "I see said Rosamund.",
    "Another coincidence you think\n\n\fShe looked at Poirot.",
    "Arent there rather too many coincidences\n\nCoincidences sid Hercule Poirot do happen.",
    "Nonsense said Maude.",
    "Helen felt ill came down and rang up the\ndoctor and then \n\nBut she didnt ring up the doctor said Rosamund.",
    "I asked him \n\nSusan said sharply\n\nWho did she ring up\n\nI dont know said Rosamund a shade of vexation passing over her\nface.",
    "But I dare say I can find out she added hopefully.",
    "II\n\nHercule Poirot was sitting in the Victorian summerhouse.",
    "He drew his\nlarge watch from his pocket and laid it on the table in front of him.",
    "He had announced that he was leaving by the twelve oclock train.",
    "There was still half an hour to go.",
    "Half an hour for someone to make up\ntheir minds and come to him.",
    "Perhaps more than one person...",
    "The summerhouse was clearly visible from most of the windows of the\nhouse.",
    "Surely soon someone would come If not his knowledge of\nhuman nature was deficient and his main premises incorrect.",
    "He waited  and above his head a spider in its web waited for a fly.",
    "It was Miss Gilchrist who came first.",
    "She was flustered and upset and\nrather incoherent.",
    "Oh Mr Pontarlier  I cant remember your other name she said.",
    "I\nhad to come and speak to you although I dont like doing it  but really I\nfeel I ought to.",
    "I mean after what happened to poor Mrs Leo this\nmorning  and I think myself Mrs Shane was quits right  and not\ncoincidence and certainly not a stroke  as Mrs Timothy suggested\nbecause my own father had a stroke and it was quite a different\nappearance and anyway the doctor said concussion quite clearly\n\nShe paused took breath and looked at Poirot with appealing eyes.",
    "Yes said Poirot gently and encouragingly.",
    "You want to tell me\nsomething\n\nAs I say I dont like doing it  because shes been so kind.",
    "She found\nme the position with Mrs Timothy and everything.",
    "Shes been really\nvery kind.",
    "Thats why I feel so ungrateful.",
    "And even gave me Mrs\nLansquenets musquash jacket which is really most handsome and fits\nbeautifully because it never matters if fur is a little on the large side.",
    "And when I wanted to return her the amethyst brooch she wouldnt\nhear of it \n\n\fYou are referring said Poirot gently to Mrs Banks\n\nYes you see... Miss Gilchrist looked down twisting her fingers\nunhappily.",
    "She looked up and said with a sudden gulp\n\nYou see.",
    "I listened\n\nYou mean you happened to overhear a conversation \n\nNo.",
    "Miss Gilchrist shook her\n\nhead with\n\nan air of\n\nheroic\n\ndetermination.",
    "Id rather speak the truth.",
    "And its not so bad telling\nyou because youre not English.",
    "Hercule Poirot understood her without taking offence.",
    "You mean that to a foreigner it is natural that people should listen at\ndoors and open letters or read letters that are left about\n\nOh Id never open anybody elses letters said Miss Gilchrist in a\nshocked tone.",
    "Not that.",
    "But I did listen that day  the day that Mr\nRichard Abernethie came down to see his sister.",
    "I was curious you\nknow about his turning up suddenly after all those years.",
    "And I did\nwonder why  and  you see when you havent much life of your own or\nvery many friends you do tend to get interested  when youre living\nwith anybody I mean.",
    "Most natural said Poirot.",
    "Yes I do think it was natural...",
    "Though not of course at all right.",
    "But I\ndid it And I heard what he said\n\n\fYou heard what Mr Abernethie said to Mrs Lansquenet\n\nYes.",
    "He said something like  Its no good talking to Timothy.",
    "He poohpoohs everything.",
    "Simply wont listen.",
    "But I thought Id like to get it off\nmy chest to you Cora.",
    "We three are the only ones left.",
    "And though\nyouve always liked to play the simpleton youve got a lot of common\nsense.",
    "So what would you do about it if you were me\n\nI couldnt quite hear what Mrs Lansquenet said but I caught the word\npolice  and then Mr Abernethie burst out quite loud and said I cant\ndo that.",
    "Not when its a question of my own niece.",
    "And then I had to\nrun in the kitchen for something boiling over and when I got back Mr\nAbernethie was saying Even if I die an unnatural death I dont want\nthe police called in if it can possibly be avoided.",
    "You understand that\ndony you my dear girl But dont worry.",
    "Now that I know I shall take all\npossible precautions.",
    "And he went on saying hed made a new will\nand that she Cora would be quite all right.",
    "And then he said about her\nhaving been happy with her husband and how perhaps hed made a\nmistake over that in the past.",
    "Miss Gilchrist stopped.",
    "Poirot said I see  I see...",
    "But I never wanted to say  to tell.",
    "I didnt think Mrs Lansquenet would\nhave wanted me to...",
    "But now  after Mrs Leo being attacked this\nmorning  and then you saying so calmly it was coincidence.",
    "But oh\nM. Pontarlier it wasnt coincidence\n\n\fPoirot smiled.",
    "He said\n\nNo it wasnt coincidence...",
    "Thank you Miss Gilchrist for coming to\nme.",
    "It was very necessary that you should.",
    "III\n\nHe had a little difficulty in getting rid of Miss Gilchrist and it was\nurgent that he should for he hoped for further confidences.",
    "His instinct was right.",
    "Miss Gilchrist had hardly gone before Gregory\nBanks striding across the lawn came impetuously into the summerhouse.",
    "His face was pale and there were beads of perspiration on his\nforehead.",
    "His eyes were curiously excited.",
    "At last he said.",
    "I thought that stupid woman would never go.",
    "Youre\nall wrong in what you said this morning.",
    "Youre wrong about\neverything.",
    "Richard Abernethie was killed.",
    "I killed him.",
    "Hercule Poirot let his eyes move up and down over the excited young\nman.",
    "He showed no surprise.",
    "So you killed him did you How\n\nGregory Banks smiled.",
    "It wasnt difficult for ms. You can surely realise that.",
    "There were\nfifteen or twenty different drugs I could lay my hands on that would do\nit.",
    "The method of administration took rather more thinking out but I hit\n\n\fon a very ingenious idea in the end.",
    "The beauty of it was that I didnt\nneed to be anywhere near at the time.",
    "Clever said Poirot.",
    "Yes.",
    "Gregory Banks cast his eyes down modestly.",
    "He seemed\npleased.",
    "Yes  I do think it was ingenious.",
    "Poirot asked with interest\n\nWhy did you kill him For the money that would come to your wife\n\nNo.",
    "No of course not.",
    "Greg was suddenly excitedly indignant.",
    "Im\nnot a money grubber.",
    "I didnt marry Susan for her money\n\nDidnt you Mr Banks\n\nThats what he thought Greg said with sudden venom.",
    "Richard\nAbernethie He liked Susan he admired her he was proud of her as an\nexample of Abernethie blood But he thought shed married beneath\nher  he thought I was no good  he despised me I dare say I hadnt the\nright accent  I didnt wear my clothes the right way.",
    "He was a snob  a\nfilthy snob\n\nI dont think so said Poirot mildly.",
    "From all I have heard Richard\nAbernethie was no snob.",
    "He was.",
    "He was.",
    "The young man spoke with something approaching\nhysteria.",
    "He thought nothing of me.",
    "He sneered at me  always very\npolite but underneath I could see that he didnt like me\n\n\fPossibly.",
    "People cant treat me like that and get away with it Theyve tried it\nbefore A woman who used to come and have her medicines made up.",
    "She was rude to me.",
    "Do you know what I did\n\nYes said Poirot.",
    "Gregory looked startled.",
    "So you know that Yes.",
    "She nearly died.",
    "He spoke in a satisfied manner.",
    "That shows you Im\nnot the sort of person to be trifled with Richard Abernethie despised\nme  and what happened to him He died.",
    "A most successful murder said Poirot with grave congratulation.",
    "He added But why come and give yourself away  to me\n\nBecause you said you were through with it all You said he hadnt\nbeen murdered.",
    "I had to show you that youre not as clever as you\nthink you are  and besides  besides \n\nYes said Poirot.",
    "And besides\n\nGreg collapsed suddenly on to the bench.",
    "His face changed.",
    "It took on\na sudden ecstatic quality.",
    "It was wrong  wicked...",
    "I must be punished...",
    "I must go back there  to\nthe place if punishment... to atone...",
    "Yes to atone Repentance\nRetribution\n\nHis face was alight now with a kind of glowing ecstasy.",
    "Poirot studied\nhim for a moment or two curiously.",
    "Then he asked\n\nHow badly do you want to get away from your wife\n\nGregorys face changed.",
    "Susan Susan is wonderful  wonderful\n\nYes.",
    "Susan is wonderful.",
    "That is a grave burden.",
    "Susan loves you\ndevotedly.",
    "That is a burden too\n\nGregory sat looking in front of him.",
    "Then he said rather in the manner\nof a sulky child\n\nWhy couldnt she let me alone\n\nHe sprang up.",
    "Shes coming now  across the lawn.",
    "Ill go now.",
    "But youll tell her\nwhat I told you Tell her Ive gone to the police station.",
    "To confess.",
    "IV\n\n\fSusan came in breathlessly.",
    "Wheres Greg He was here I saw him.",
    "Yes.",
    "Poirot paused a moment  before saying He came to tell me\nthat it was he who poisoned Richard Abernethie...\n\nWhat absolute nonsense You didnt believe him I hope\n\nWhy should I not believe him\n\nHe wasnt even near this place when Uncle Richard died\n\nPerhaps not.",
    "Where was he when Cora Lansquenet died\n\nIn London.",
    "We both were.",
    "Hercule Poirot shook his head.",
    "No no that will not do.",
    "You for instance took out your car that day\nand were away all the afternoon.",
    "I think I know where you went.",
    "You\nwent to Lytchett St Mary.",
    "I did no such thing\n\nPoirot smiled.",
    "When I met you here Madame it was not as I told you the first time I\nhad seen you.",
    "After the inquest on Mrs Lansquenet you were in the\ngarage of the Kings Arms.",
    "You talk there to a mechanic and close by\n\n\fyou is a car containing an elderly foreign gentleman.",
    "You did not notice\nhim but he noticed you.",
    "I dont see what you mean.",
    "That was the day of the inquest.",
    "Ah but remember what that mechanic said to you He asked you if\nyou were a relative of the victim and you said you were her niece.",
    "He was just being a ghoul.",
    "Theyre all ghouls.",
    "And his next words were Ah wondered where Id seen you before.",
    "Where did he see you before Madame It must have been in Lytchett\nSt Mary since in his mind his seeing you before was accounted for by\nyour being Mrs Lansquenets niece.",
    "Had he seen you near her\ncottage And when It was a matter was it not that demands inquiry.",
    "And the result of the inquiry is that you were there  in Lytchett St\nMary  on the afternoon Cora Lansquenet died.",
    "You parked your car in\nthe same quarry where you left it the morning of the inquest.",
    "The car\nwas seen and the number was noted.",
    "By this time Inspector Morton\nknows whose car it was.",
    "Susan stared at him.",
    "Her breath came rather fast but she showed no\nsigns of discomposure.",
    "Youre talking nonsense M. Poirot.",
    "And youre making me forget what\nI came here to say  I wanted to try and find you alone \n\nTo confess to me that it was you and not your husband who\ncommitted the murder\n\n\fNo of course not.",
    "What kind of a fool do you think I am And Ive\nalready told you that Gregory never left London that day.",
    "A fact which you cannot possibly know since you were away yourself.",
    "Why did you go down to Lytchett St Mary Mrs Banks\n\nSusan drew a deep breath.",
    "All right if you must have it What Cora said at the funeral worried me.",
    "I kept on thinking about it.",
    "Finally I decided to run down in the car and\nsee her and ask her what had put the idea into her head.",
    "Greg thought\nit a silly idea so I didnt even tell him where I was going.",
    "I got there\nabout three oclock knocked and rang but there was no answer so I\nthought she must be out or gone away.",
    "Thats all there is to it.",
    "I didnt\ngo round to the back of the cottage.",
    "If I had I might have seen the\nbroken window.",
    "I just went back to London without the faintest idea\nthere was anything wrong.",
    "Poirots face was noncommittal.",
    "He said\n\nWhy does your husband accuse himself of the crime\n\nBecause hes  a word trembled on Susans tongue and was rejected.",
    "Poirot seized on it.",
    "You were going to say because he is batty speaking in jest  but the\njest was too near the truth was it not\n\nGregs all right.",
    "He is.",
    "He is.",
    "I know something of his history said Poirot.",
    "He was for some\nmonths in Forsdyke House Mental Home before you met him.",
    "He was never certified.",
    "He was a voluntary patient.",
    "That is true.",
    "He is not I agree to be classed as insane.",
    "But he is very\ndefinitely unbalanced.",
    "He has a punishment complex has had it I\nsuspect since infancy.",
    "Susan spoke quickly and eagerly\n\nYou dont understand M. Poirot.",
    "Greg has never had a chance.",
    "Thats\nwhy I wanted Uncle Richards money so badly.",
    "Uncle Richard was so\nmatteroffact.",
    "He couldnt understand.",
    "I knew Greg had got to set up\nfor himself.",
    "He had got to feel he was someone  not just a chemists\nassistant being pushed around.",
    "Everything will be different now.",
    "He\nwill have his own laboratory.",
    "He can work out his own formulas.",
    "Yes yes  you will give him the earth  because you love him.",
    "Love him\ntoo much for safety or for happiness.",
    "But you cannot give to people\nwhat they are incapable of receiving.",
    "At the end of it all he will still be\nsomething that he does not want to be...\n\nWhats that\n\nSusans husband.",
    "How cruel you are And what nonsense you talk\n\n\fWhere Gregory Banks is concerned you are unscrupulous.",
    "You\nwanted your uncles money  not for yourself  but for your husband.",
    "How badly did you want it\n\nAngrily Susan turned and dashed away.",
    "V\n\nI thought said Michael Shane lightly that Id just come along and\nsay goodbye.",
    "He smiled and his smile had a singularly intoxicating quality.",
    "Poirot was aware of the mans vital charm.",
    "He studied Michael Shane for some moments in silence.",
    "He felt as\nthough he knew this man least well of all the house party for Michael\nShane only showed the side he wanted to show.",
    "Your wife said Poirot conversationally is a very unusual woman.",
    "Michael raised his eyebrows.",
    "Do you think so Shes a lovely I agree.",
    "But not or so Ive found\nconspicuous for brains.",
    "She will never try to be too clever Poirot agreed.",
    "But she knows\nwhat she wants.",
    "He sighed.",
    "So few people do.",
    "Ah Michaels smile broke out again.",
    "Thinking of the malachite\ntable\n\nPerhaps.",
    "Poirot paused and added And of what was on it.",
    "The wax flowers you mean\n\nThe wax flowers.",
    "Michael frowned.",
    "I dont always quite understand you M. Poirot.",
    "However the smile\nwas switched on again Im more thankful than I can say that were all\nout of the wood.",
    "Its unpleasant to say the least of it to go around with\nthe suspicion that somehow or other one of us murdered poor old\nUncle Richard.",
    "That is how he seemed to you when you met him Poirot inquired.",
    "Poor old Uncle Richard\n\nOf course he was very well preserved and all that \n\nAnd in full possession of his faculties \n\nOh yes.",
    "And in fact quite shrewd\n\nI dare say.",
    "A shrewd judge of character.",
    "The smile remained unaltered.",
    "You cant expect me to agree with that M. Poirot.",
    "He didnt approve of\nme.",
    "He thought you perhaps the unfaithful type Poirot suggested.",
    "Michael laughed.",
    "What an oldfashioned idea\n\nBut it is true isnt it\n\nNow I wonder what you mean by that\n\nPoirot placed the tips of his fingers together.",
    "There have been inquiries made you know he murmured.",
    "By you\n\nNot only by me.",
    "Michael Shane gave him a quick searching glance.",
    "His reactions\nPoirot noted were quick.",
    "Michael Shane was no fool.",
    "You mean  the police are interested\n\n\fThey have never been quite satisfied you know to regard the murder\nof Cora Lansquenet as a casual crime.",
    "And theyve been making inquiries about me\n\nPoirot said primly\n\nThey are interested in the movements of Mrs Lansquenets relations\non the day that she was killed.",
    "Thats extremely awkward.",
    "Michael spoke with a\n\ncharming\n\nconfidential rueful air.",
    "Is it Mr Shane\n\nMore so than you can imagine I told Rosamund you see that I was\nlunching with a certain Oscar Lewis on that day.",
    "When in actual fact you were not\n\nNo.",
    "Actually I motored down to see a woman called Sorrel Dainton quite a wellknown actress.",
    "I was with her in her last show.",
    "Rather\nawkward you see for though its quite satisfactory as far as the police\nare concerned it wont go down very well with Rosamund.",
    "Ah Poirot looked discreet.",
    "There has been a little trouble over this\nfriendship of yours\n\nYes...",
    "In fact  Rosamund made me promise I wouldnt see her any\nmore.",
    "Yes I can see that may be awkward... Entre nous you had an affair\nwith the lady\n\nOh just one of those things Its not as though I cared for the woman\nat all.",
    "But she cares for you\n\nWell shes been rather tiresome... Women do cling so.",
    "However as\nyou say the police at any rate will be satisfied.",
    "You think so\n\nWell I could hardly be taking a hatchet to Cora if I was dallying with\nSorrel miles and miles away.",
    "Shes got a cottage in Kent.",
    "I see  I see  and this Miss Dainton she will testify for you\n\nShe wont like it  but as its murder I suppose shell have to do it.",
    "She will do it perhaps even if you were not dallying with her.",
    "What do you mean Michael looked suddenly black as thunder.",
    "The lady is fond of you.",
    "When they are fond women will swear to what\nis true  and also to what is untrue.",
    "Do you mean to say that you dont believe me\n\n\fIt does not matter if I believe you or not.",
    "It is not I you have to satisfy.",
    "Who then\n\nPoirot smiled.",
    "Inspector Morton  who has just come out on the terrace through the\nside door.",
    "Michael Shane wheeled round sharply.",
    "Chapter 23\n\nI heard you were here M. Poirot said Inspector Morton.",
    "The two men were pacing the terrace together.",
    "I came over with Superintendent Parwell from Matchfield.",
    "Dr Larraby\nrang him up about Mrs Leo Abernethie and hes come over here to\nmake a few inquiries.",
    "The doctor wasnt satisfied.",
    "And you my friend inquired Poirot where do you come in You are\na long way from your native Berkshire.",
    "I wanted to ask a few questions  and the people I wanted to ask them\nof seemed very conveniently assembled here.",
    "He paused before\nadding Your doing\n\nYes my doing.",
    "And as a result Mrs Leo Abernethie gets knocked out.",
    "You must not blame me for that.",
    "If she had come to me...",
    "But she did\nnot.",
    "Instead she rang up her lawyer in London.",
    "And was in process of spilling the beans to him when  Wonk\n\nWhen  as you say  Wonk\n\nAnd what had she managed to tell him\n\nVery little.",
    "She had only got as far as telling him that she was looking\nat herself in the glass.",
    "Ah well said Inspector Morton philosophically.",
    "Women will do it.",
    "He looked sharply at Poirot.",
    "That suggests something to you\n\nYes I think I know what it was she was going to tell him.",
    "Wonderful guesser arent you You always were.",
    "Well what was it\n\nExcuse me are you inquiring into the death of Richard Abernethie\n\nOfficially no.",
    "Actually of course if it has a bearing on the murder of\nMrs Lansquenet \n\nIt has a bearing on that yes.",
    "But I will ask you my friend to give me a\nfew more hours.",
    "I shall know by then if what I have imagined  imagined\nonly you comprehend  is correct.",
    "If it is \n\n\fWell if it is\n\nThen I may be able to place in your hands a piece of concrete\nevidence.",
    "We could certainly do with it said Inspector Morton with feeling.",
    "He\nlooked askance at Poirot.",
    "What have you been holding back\n\nNothing.",
    "Absolutely nothing.",
    "Since the piece of evidence I have\nimagined may not in fact exist.",
    "I have only deduced its existence from\nvarious scraps of conversation.",
    "I may said Poirot in a completely\nunconvinced tone be wrong.",
    "Morton smiled.",
    "But that doesnt often happen to you\n\nNo.",
    "Though I will admit  yes I am forced to admit  that it has\nhappened to me.",
    "I must say Im glad to hear it To be always right must be sometimes\nmonotonous.",
    "I do not find it so Poirot assured him.",
    "Inspector Morton laughed.",
    "And youre asking me to hold off with my questioning\n\n\fNo no not at all.",
    "Proceed as you had planned to do.",
    "I suppose you\nwere not actually contemplating an arrest\n\nMorton shook his head.",
    "Much too flimsy for that.",
    "Wed have to get a decision from the Public\nProsecutor first  and were a long way from that.",
    "No just statements\nfrom certain parties of their movements on the day in question  in one\ncase with a caution perhaps.",
    "I see.",
    "Mrs Banks\n\nSmart arent you Yes.",
    "She was there that day.",
    "Her car was parked in\nthat quarry.",
    "She was not seen actually driving the car\n\nNo.",
    "The Inspector added Its bad you know that shes never said a word\nabout being down there that day.",
    "Shes got to explain that\nsatisfactorily.",
    "She is quite skillful at explanations said Poirot dryly.",
    "Yes.",
    "Clever\nyoung lady.",
    "Perhaps a thought too clever.",
    "It is never wise to be too clever.",
    "That is how murderers get caught.",
    "Has anything more come up about George Crossfield\n\n\fNothing definite.",
    "Hes a very ordinary type.",
    "There are a lot of young\nmen like him going about the country in trains and buses or on\nbicycles.",
    "People find it hard to remember when a week or so has gone\nby if it was Wednesday or Thursday when they were at a certain place\nor noticed a certain person.",
    "He paused and went on Weve had one piece of rather curious\ninformation  from the Mother Superior of some convent or other.",
    "Two\nof her nuns had been out collecting from door to door.",
    "It seems that\nthey went to Mrs Lansquenets cottage on the day before she was\nmurdered but couldnt make anyone hear when they knocked and\nrang.",
    "Thats natural enough  she was up North at the Abernethie\nfuneral and Gilchrist had been given the day off and had gone on an\nexcursion to Bournemouth.",
    "The point is that they say there was\nsomeone in the cottage.",
    "They say they heard sighs and groans.",
    "Ive\nqueried whether it wasnt a day later but the Mother Superior is quite\ndefinite that that couldnt be so.",
    "Its all entered up in some book.",
    "Was\nthere someone searching for something in the cottage that day who\nseized the opportunity of both the women being away And did that\nsomebody not find what he or she was looking for and come back the\nnext day I dont set much store on the sighs and still less on the\ngroans.",
    "Even nuns are suggestible and a cottage where murder has\noccurred positively asks for groans.",
    "The point is was there someone\nin the cottage who shouldnt have been there And if so who was it\nAll the Abernethie crowd were at the funeral.",
    "Poirot asked a seemingly irrelevant question\n\nThese nuns who were collecting in that district did they return at all\nat a later date to try again\n\n\fAs a matter of fact they did come again  about a week later.",
    "Actually\non the day of the inquest I believe.",
    "That fits said Hercule Poirot.",
    "That fits very well.",
    "Inspector Morton looked at him.",
    "Why this interest in nuns\n\nThey have been forced on my attention whether I will or no.",
    "It will not\nhave escaped your attention Inspector that the visit of the nuns was\nthe same day that poisoned wedding cake found its way into that\ncottage.",
    "You dont think  Surely thats a ridiculous idea\n\nMy ideas are never ridiculous said Hercule Poirot severely.",
    "And\nnow mon cher I must leave you to your questions and to the inquiries\ninto the attack on Mrs Abernethie.",
    "I myself must go in search of the\nlate Richard Abernethies niece.",
    "Now be careful what you go saying to Mrs Banks.",
    "I do not mean Mrs Banks.",
    "I mean Richard Abernethies other niece.",
    "II\n\nPoirot found Rosamund sitting on a bench overlooking a little stream\nthat cascaded down in a waterfall and then flowed through\nrhododendron thickets.",
    "She was staring into the water.",
    "I do not I trust disturb an Ophelia said Poirot as he took his seat\nbeside her.",
    "You are perhaps studying the r\u00f4le\n\nIve never played in Shakespeare said Rosamund.",
    "Except once in\nRep.",
    "I was Jessica in The Merchant.",
    "A lousy part.",
    "Yet not without pathos.",
    "I am never merry when I hear sweet music.",
    "What a load she carried poor Jessica the daughter of the hated and\ndespised Jew.",
    "What doubts of herself she must have had when she\nbrought with her her fathers ducats when she ran away to her lover.",
    "Jessica with gold was one thing  Jessica without gold might have\nbeen another.",
    "Rosamund turned her head to look at him.",
    "I thought youd gone she said with a touch of reproach.",
    "She glanced\ndown at her wristwatch.",
    "Its past twelve oclock.",
    "I have missed my train said Poirot.",
    "Why\n\nYou think I missed it for a reason\n\nI suppose so.",
    "Youre rather precise arent you If you wanted to\ncatch a train I should think youd catch it.",
    "Your judgment is admirable.",
    "Do you know Madame I have been\nsitting in the little summerhouse hoping that you would perhaps pay\nme a visit there\n\n\fRosamund stared at him.",
    "Why should I You more or less said goodbye to us all in the library.",
    "Quite so.",
    "And there was nothing  you wanted to say to me\n\nNo.",
    "Rosamund shook her head.",
    "I had a lot I wanted to think about.",
    "Important things.",
    "I see.",
    "I dont often do much thinking said Rosamund.",
    "It seems a waste of\ntime.",
    "But this is important.",
    "I think one ought to plan ones life just as\none wants it to be.",
    "And that is what you are doing\n\nWell yes...",
    "I was trying to make a decision about something.",
    "About your husband\n\nIn a way.",
    "Poirot waited a moment then he said\n\nInspector Morton has just arrived here.",
    "He anticipated Rosamunds\nquestion by going on He is the police officer in charge of the inquiries\nabout Mrs Lansquenets death.",
    "He has come here to get statements\nfrom you all about what you were doing on the day she was murdered.",
    "I see.",
    "Alibis said Rosamund cheerfully.",
    "Her beautiful face relaxed into an impish glee.",
    "That will be hell for Michael she said.",
    "He thinks I dont really know\nhe went off to be with that woman that day.",
    "How did you know\n\nIt was obvious from the way he said he was going to lunch with Oscar.",
    "So frightfully casually you know and his nose twitching just a tiny bit\nlike it always does when he tells lies.",
    "How devoutly thankful I am I am not married to you Madame\n\nAnd then of course I made sure by ringing up Oscar continued\nRosamund.",
    "Men always tell such silly lies.",
    "He is not I fear a very faithful husband Poirot hazarded.",
    "Rosamund however did not reject the statement.",
    "But you do not mind\n\nWell its rather fun in a way said Rosamund.",
    "I mean having a\nhusband that all the other women want to snatch away from you.",
    "I\nshould hate to be married to a man that nobody wanted  like poor\nSusan.",
    "Really Greg is so completely wet\n\n\fPoirot was studying her.",
    "And suppose someone did succeed  in snatching your husband away\nfrom you\n\nThey wont said Rosamund.",
    "Not now she added.",
    "You mean \n\nNot now that theres Uncle Richards money.",
    "Michael falls for these\ncreatures in a way  that Sorrel Dainton woman nearly got her hooks\ninto him  wanted him for keeps  but with Michael the show will always\ncome first.",
    "He can launch out now in a big way  put his own shows on.",
    "Do some production as well as acting.",
    "Hes ambitious you know and\nhe really is good.",
    "Not like me I adore acting  but Im ham though I\nlook nice.",
    "No Im not worried about Michael any more.",
    "Because its my\nmoney you see.",
    "Her eyes met Poirots calmly.",
    "He thought how strange it was that both\nRichard Abernethies nieces should have fallen deeply in love with men\nwho were incapable of returning that love.",
    "And yet Rosamund was\nunusually beautiful and Susan was attractive and full of sex appeal.",
    "Susan needed and clung to the illusion that Gregory loved her.",
    "Rosamund clearsighted had no illusions at all but knew what she\nwanted.",
    "The point is said Rosamund that Ive got to make a big decision about the future.",
    "Michael doesnt know yet.",
    "Her face curved into a smile.",
    "He found out that I wasnt shopping that\nday and hes madly suspicious about Regents Park.",
    "What is this about Regents Park Poirot looked puzzled.",
    "I went there you see after Harley Street.",
    "Just to walk about and\nthink.",
    "Naturally Michael thinks that if I went there at all I went to meet\nsome man\n\nRosamund smiled beatifically and added\n\nHe didnt like that at all\n\nBut why should you not go to Regents Park asked Poirot.",
    "Just to walk there you mean\n\nYes.",
    "Have you never done it before\n\nNever.",
    "Why should I What is there to go to Regents Park for\n\nPoirot looked at her and said\n\nFor you  nothing.",
    "He added\n\nI think Madame that you must cede the green malachite table to your\ncousin Susan.",
    "Rosamunds eyes opened very wide.",
    "Why should I I want it.",
    "I know.",
    "I know.",
    "But you  you will keep your husband.",
    "And the poor\nSusan she will lose hers.",
    "Lose him Do you mean Gregs going off with someone I wouldnt\nhave believed it of him.",
    "He looks so wet.",
    "Infidelity is not the only way of losing a husband Madame.",
    "You dont mean Rosamund stared at him.",
    "Youre not thinking that\nGreg poisoned Uncle Richard and killed Aunt Cora and conked Aunt\nHelen on the head Thats ridiculous.",
    "Even I know better than that.",
    "Who did then\n\nGeorge of course.",
    "George is a wrong un you know hes mixed up in\nsome sort of currency swindle  I heard about it from some friends of\nmine who were in Monte.",
    "I expect Uncle Richard got to know about it\nand was just going to cut him out of his will.",
    "Rosamund added complacently\n\nIve always known it was George.",
    "Chapter 24\n\nThe telegram came about six oclock that evening.",
    "As specially requested it was delivered by hand not telephoned and\nHercule Poirot who had been hovering for some time in the\nneighbourhood of the front door was at hand to receive it from\nLanscombe as the latter took it from the telegraph boy.",
    "He tore it open with somewhat less than his usual precision.",
    "It\nconsisted of three words and a signature.",
    "Poirot gave vent to an enormous sigh of relief.",
    "Then he took a pound note from his pocket and handed it to the\ndumbfounded boy.",
    "There are moments he said to Lanscombe when economy should\nbe abandoned.",
    "Very possibly sir said Lanscombe politely.",
    "Where is Inspector Morton asked Poirot.",
    "One of the police gentlemen Lanscombe spoke with distaste  and\nindicated subtly that such things as names for police officers were\nimpossible to remember  has left.",
    "The other is I believe in the\nstudy.",
    "Splendid said Poirot.",
    "I join him immediately.",
    "He once more clapped Lanscombe on the shoulder and said\n\n\fCourage we are on the point of arriving\n\nLanscombe looked slightly bewildered since departures and not\narrivals had been in his mind.",
    "He said\n\nYou do not then propose to leave by the ninethirty train after all\nsir\n\nDo not lose hope Poirot told him.",
    "Poirot moved away then wheeling round he asked\n\nI wonder can you remember what were the first words Mrs\nLansquenet said to you when she arrived here on the day of your\nmasters funeral\n\nI remember very well sir said Lanscombe his face lighting up.",
    "Miss Cora  I beg pardon Mrs Lansquenet  I always think of her as\nMiss Cora somehow \n\nVery naturally.",
    "She said to me Hallo Lanscombe.",
    "Its a long time since you used to\nbring us out meringues to the huts.",
    "All the children used to have a hut\nof their own  down by the fence in the Park.",
    "In summer when there\nwas going to be a dinner party I used to take the young ladies and\ngentlemen  the younger ones you understand sir  some meringues.",
    "Miss Cora sir was always very fond of her food.",
    "Poirot nodded.",
    "Yes he said that was as I thought.",
    "Yes it was very typical that.",
    "He went into the study to find Inspector Morton and without a word\nhanded him the telegram.",
    "Morton read it blankly.",
    "I don t understand a word of this.",
    "The time has come to tell you all.",
    "Inspector Morton grinned.",
    "You sound like a young lady in a Victorian melodrama.",
    "But its about\ntime you came across with something.",
    "I cant hold out on this setup\nmuch longer.",
    "That Banks fellow is still insisting that he poisoned\nRichard Abernethie and boasting that we cant find out how.",
    "What\nbeats me is why theres always somebody who comes forward when\ntheres a murder and yells out that they did it What do they think there\nis in it for them Ive never been able to fathom that.",
    "In this case probably shelter from the difficulties of being responsible\nfor oneself  in other words  Forsdyke Sanatorium.",
    "More likely to be Broadmoor.",
    "That might be equally satisfactory.",
    "Did he do it Poirot The Gilchrist woman came out with the story\nshed already told you and it would fit with what Richard Abernethie\nsaid about his niece.",
    "If her husband did it it would involve her.",
    "Somehow you know I cant visualise that girl committing a lot of\ncrimes.",
    "But theres nothing she wouldnt do to try and cover him.",
    "I will tell you all \n\nYes yes tell me all And for the Lords sake hurry up and do it\n\nII\n\nThis time it was in the big drawingroom that Hercule Poirot assembled\nhis audience.",
    "There was amusement rather than tension in the faces that were\nturned towards him.",
    "Menace had materialised in the shape of\nInspector Morton and Superintendent Parwell.",
    "With the police in\ncharge questioning asking for statements Hercule Poirot private\ndetective lad receded into something closely resembling a joke.",
    "Timothy was not far from voicing the general feeling when he\nremarked in an audible sotto voce to his wife\n\nDamned little mountebank Entwhistle must be gaga  thats all I can\nsay.",
    "It looked as though Hercule Poirot would have to work hard to make\nhis proper effect.",
    "He began in a slightly pompous manner.",
    "For the second time I announce my departure This morning I\nannounced it for the twelve oclock train.",
    "This evening I announce it for\nthe ninethirty  immediately that is after dinner.",
    "I go because there is\nnothing more here for me to do.",
    "Could have told him that all along.",
    "Timothys commentary was still in\nevidence.",
    "Never was anything for him to do.",
    "The cheek of these\nfellows\n\nI came here originally to solve a riddle.",
    "The riddle is solved.",
    "Let me\nfirst go over the various points which were brought to my attention by\nthe excellent Mr Entwhistle.",
    "First Mr Richard Abernethie dies suddenly.",
    "Secondly after his\nfuneral his sister Cora Lansquenet says He was murdered wasnt\nhe Thirdly Mrs Lansquenet is killed.",
    "The question is are those three\nthings part of a sequence Let us observe what happens next Miss\nGilchrist the dead womans companion is taken ill after eating a piece\nof wedding cake which contains arsenic.",
    "That then is the next step in\nthe sequence.",
    "Now as I told you this morning in the course of my inquiries I have\ncome across nothing  nothing at all to substantiate the belief that Mr\nAbernethie was poisoned.",
    "Equally I may say I have found nothing to\nprove conclusively that he was not poisoned.",
    "But as we proceed\nthings become easier.",
    "Cora Lansquenet undoubtedly asked that\nsensational question at the funeral.",
    "Everyone agrees upon that.",
    "And\n\n\fundoubtedly on the following day Mrs Lansquenet was murdered  a\nhatchet being the instrument employed.",
    "Now let us examine the fourth\nhappening.",
    "The local post van driver is strongly of the belief  though\nhe will not definitely swear to it  that he did not deliver that parcel of\nwedding cake in the usual way.",
    "And if that is so then the parcel was\nleft by hand and though we cannot exclude a person unknown  we\nmust take particular notice of those people who were actually on the\nspot and in a position to put the parcel where it was subsequently\nfound.",
    "Those were Miss Gilchrist herself of course Susan Banks who\ncame down that day for the inquest Mr Entwhistle but yes we must\nconsider Mr Entwhistle he was present remember when Cora made\nher disquieting remark And there were two other people.",
    "An old\ngentleman who represented himself to be a Mr Guthrie an art critic\nand a nun or nuns who called early that morning to collect a\nsubscription.",
    "Now I decided that I would start on the assumption that the postal van\ndrivers recollection was correct.",
    "Therefore the little group of people\nunder suspicion must be very carefully studied.",
    "Miss Gilchrist did not\nbenefit in any way by Richard Abernethies death and in only a very\nminute degree by Mrs Lansquenets  in actual fact the death of the\nlatter put her out of employment and left her with the possibility of\nfinding it difficult to get new employment.",
    "Also Miss Gilchrist was\ntaken to hospital definitely suffering from arsenical poisoning.",
    "Susan Banks did benefit from Richard Abernethies death and in a\nsmall degree from Mrs Lansquenets  though here her motive must\nalmost certainly have been security.",
    "She might have very good reason\nto believe that Miss Gilchrist had overheard a conversation between\nCora Lansquenet and her brother which referred to her and she might\n\n\ftherefore decide that Miss Gilchrist must be eliminated.",
    "She herself\nremember refused to partake of the wedding cake and also suggested\nnot calling in a doctor until the morning when Miss Gilchrist was taken\nill in the night.",
    "Mr Entwhistle did not benefit by either of the deaths  but he had had\nconsiderable control over Mr Abernethies affairs and the trust funds\nand there might well be some reason why Richard Abernethie should\nnot live too long.",
    "But  you will say  if it is Mr Entwhistle who was\nconcerned why should he come to me\n\nAnd to that I will answer  it is not the first time that a murderer has\nbeen too sure of himself.",
    "We now come to what I may call the two outsiders.",
    "Mr Guthrie and a\nnun.",
    "If Mr Guthrie is really Mr Guthrie the art critic then that clears\nhim.",
    "The same applies to the nun if she is really a nun.",
    "The question is\nare these people themselves or are they somebody else\n\nAnd I may say that there seems to be a curious  motif  one might call\nit  of a nun running through this business.",
    "A nun comes to the door of\nMr Timothy Abernethies house and Miss Gilchrist believes it is the\nsame nun she has seen at Lychett St Mary.",
    "Also a nun or nuns called\nhere the day before Mr Abernethie died...\n\nGeorge Crossfield murmured Three to one the nun.",
    "Poirot went on\n\n\fSo he we have certain pieces of our pattern  the death of Mr\nAbernethie the murder of Cora Lansquenet the poisoned wedding\ncake the motif of the nun.",
    "I will add some other features of the case that engaged my attention\n\nThe visit of an art critic a smell of oil paint a picture postcard of\nPolflexan harbour and finally a bouquet of wax flowers standing on\nthat malachite table where a Chinese vase stands now.",
    "It was reflecting on these things that led me to the truth  and I am\nnow about to tell you the truth.",
    "The first part of it I told you this morning.",
    "Richard Abernethie died\nsuddenly  but there would have been no reason at all to suspect foul\nplay had it not been for the words uttered by his sister Cora at his\nfuneral.",
    "The whole case for the murder of Richard Abernethie rests\nupon those words.",
    "As a result of them you all believed that murder\nhad taken place and you believed it not really because of the words\nthemselves but because of the character of Cora Lansquenet herself.",
    "For Cora Lansquenet had always been famous for speaking the truth\nat awkward moments.",
    "So the case for Richards murder rested not\nonly upon what Cora had said but upon Cora herself.",
    "And now I come to the question that I suddenly asked myself\n\nHow well did you all know Cora Lansquenet\n\nHe was silent for a moment and Susan asked sharply What do you\nmean\n\n\fPoirot went on\n\nNot well at all  that is the answer The younger generation had never\nseen her at all or if so only when they were very young children.",
    "There were actually only three people present that day who actually\nknew Cora.",
    "Lanscombe the butler who is old and very blind Mrs\nTimothy Abernethie who had only seen her a few times round about\nthe date of her own wedding and Mrs Leo Abernethie who had known\nher quite well but who had not seen her for over twenty years.",
    "So I said to myself Supposing it was not Cora Lansquenet who came\nto the funeral that day\n\nDo you mean that Aunt Cora  wasnt Aunt Cora Susan demanded\nincredulously.",
    "Do you mean that it wasnt Aunt Cora who was\nmurdered but someone else\n\nNo no it was Cora Lansquenet who was murdered.",
    "But it was not\nCora Lansquenet who came the day before to her brothers funeral.",
    "The woman who came that day came for one purpose only  to exploit\none may say the fact that Richard died suddenly.",
    "And to create in the\nminds of his relations the belief that he had been murdered.",
    "Which she\nmanaged to do most successfully\n\nNonsense Why What was the point of it Maude spoke bluffly.",
    "Why To draw attention away from the other murder.",
    "From the\nmurder of Cora Lansquenet herself.",
    "For if Cora says that Richard has\nbeen murdered and the next day she herself is killed the two deaths\n\n\fare bound to be at least considered as possible cause and effect.",
    "But if\nCora is murdered and her cottage is broken into and if the apparent\nrobbery does not convince the police then they will look  where\nClose at home will they not Suspicion will tend to fall on the woman\nwho shares the house with her.",
    "Miss Gilchrist protested in a tone that was almost bright\n\nOh come  really  Mr Pontarlier  you dont suggest Id commit a\nmurder for an amethyst brooch and a few worthless sketches\n\nNo said Poirot.",
    "For a little more than that.",
    "There was one of those\nsketches Miss Gilchrist that represented Polflexan harbour and\nwhich as Mrs Banks was clever enough to realise had been copied\nfrom a picture postcard which showed the old pier still in position.",
    "But\nMrs Lansquenet painted always from life.",
    "I remembered then that Mr\nEntwhistle had mentioned there being a smell of oil paint in the cottage\nwhen he first got there.",
    "You can paint cant you Miss Gilchrist Your\nfather was an artist and you know a good deal about pictures.",
    "Supposing that one of the pictures that Cora picked up cheaply at a\nsale was a valuable picture.",
    "Supposing that she herself did not\nrecognise it for what it was but that you did.",
    "You knew she was\nexpecting very shortly a visit from an old friend of hers who was a\nwellknown art critic.",
    "Then her brother dies suddenly  and a plan\nleaps into your head.",
    "Easy to administer a sedative to her in her early\ncup of tea that will keep her unconscious for the whole of the day of\nthe funeral whilst you yourself are playing her part at Enderby.",
    "You\nknow Enderby well from listening to her talk about it.",
    "She has talked\nas people do when they get on in life a great deal about her childhood\ndays.",
    "Easy for you to start off by a remark to old Lanscombe about\n\n\fmeringues and huts which will make him quite sure of your identity in\ncase he was inclined to doubt.",
    "Yes you used your knowledge of\nEnderby well that day with allusions to this and that and recalling\nmemories.",
    "None of them suspected you were not Cora.",
    "You were\nwearing her clothes slightly padded and since she wore a false front\nof hair it was easy for you to assume that.",
    "Nobody had seen Cora for\ntwenty years  and in twenty years people change so much that one\noften hears the remark I would never have known her But\nmannerisms are remembered and Cora had certain very definite\nmannerisms all of which you had practised carefully before the glass.",
    "And it was there strangely enough that you made your first mistake.",
    "You forgot that a mirror image is reversed.",
    "When you saw in the glass\nthe perfect reproduction of Coras birdlike sidewise tilt of the head\nyou didnt realise that it was actually the wrong way round.",
    "You saw\nlet us say Cora inclining her head to the right  but you forgot that\nactually your own head was inclined to the left to produce that effect in\nthe glass.",
    "That was what puzzled and worried Helen Abernethie at the moment\nwhen you made your famous insinuation.",
    "Something seemed to her\nwrong.",
    "I realised myself the other night when Rosamund Shane made\nan unexpected remark what happens on such an occasion.",
    "Everybody\ninevitably looks at the speaker.",
    "Therefore when Mrs Leo felt\nsomething was wrong it must be that something was wrong with\nCora Lansquenet.",
    "The other evening after talk about mirror images\nand seeing oneself I think Mrs Leo experimented before a lookingglass.",
    "Her own face is not particularly asymmetrical.",
    "She probably\nthought of Cora remembered how Cora used to incline her head to the\nright did so and looked in the glass when of course the image\n\n\fseemed to her wrong and she realised in a flash just what had been\nwrong on the day of the funeral.",
    "She puzzled it out  either Cora had\ntaken to inclining her head in the opposite direction  most unlikely  or\nelse Cora had not ben Cora.",
    "Neither way seemed to her to make\nsense.",
    "But she determined to tell Mr Entwhistle of her discovery at\nonce.",
    "Someone who was used to getting up early was already about\nand followed her down and fearful of what revelations she might be\nabout to make struck her down with a heavy doorstop.",
    "Poirot paused and added\n\nI may as well tell you now Miss Gilchrist that Mrs Abernethies\nconcussion is not serious.",
    "She will soon be able to tell us her own\nstory.",
    "I never did anything of the sort said Miss Gilchrist.",
    "The whole thing\nis a wicked lie.",
    "It was you that day said Michael Shane suddenly.",
    "He had been\nstudying Miss Gilchrists face.",
    "I ought to have seen it sooner  I felt in\na vague kind of way I had seen you before somewhere  but of course\none never looks much at  he stopped.",
    "No one doesnt bother to look at a mere companionhelp said Miss\nGilchrist.",
    "Her voice shook a little.",
    "A drudge a domestic drudge\nAlmost a servant But go on M. Poirot.",
    "Go on with this fantastic piece\nof nonsense\n\nThe suggestion of murder thrown out at the funeral was only the first\nstep of course said Poirot.",
    "You had more in reserve.",
    "At any moment\n\n\fyou were prepared to admit to having listened to a conversation\nbetween Richard and his sister.",
    "What he actually told her no doubt\nwas the fact that he had not long to live and that explains a cryptic\nphrase in the letter he wrote her after getting home.",
    "The nun was\nanother of your suggestions.",
    "The nun  or rather nuns  who called at\nthe cottage on the day of the inquest suggested to you a mention of a\nnun who was following you round and you used that when you were\nanxious to hear what Mrs Timothy was saying to her sisterinlaw at\nEnderby.",
    "And also because you wished to accompany her there and\nfind out for yourself just how suspicions were going.",
    "Actually to poison\nyourself badly but not fatally with arsenic is a very old device  and I\nmay say that it served to awaken Inspector Mortons suspicions of\nyou.",
    "But the picture said Rosamund.",
    "What kind of a picture was it\n\nPoirot slowly unfolded a telegram.",
    "This morning I rang up Mr Entwhistle a responsible person to go to\nStansfield Grange and acting on authority from Mr Abernethie himself\n here Poirot gave a hard stare at Timothy to look amongst the\npictures in Miss Gilchrists room and select the one of Polflexan\nHarbour on pretext of having it reframed as a surprise for Miss\nGilchrist.",
    "He was to take it back to London and call upon Mr Guthrie\nwhom I had warned by telegram.",
    "The hastily painted sketch of\nPolflexan Harbour was removed and the original picture exposed.",
    "He held up the telegram and read\n\nDefinitely a Vermeer.",
    "Guthrie.",
    "Suddenly with electrifying effect Miss Gilchrist burst into speech.",
    "I knew it was a Vermeer.",
    "I knew it She didnt know Talking about\nRembrandts and Italian Primitives and unable to recognise a Vermeer\nwhen it was under her nose Always prating about Art  and really\nknowing nothing about it She was a thoroughly stupid woman.",
    "Always\nmaundering on about this place  about Enderby and what they did\nthere as children and about Richard and Timothy and Laura and all\nthe rest of them.",
    "Rolling in money always Always the best of\neverything those children had.",
    "You dont know how boring it is\nlistening to somebody going on about the same things hour after hour\nand day after day.",
    "And saying Oh yes Mrs Lansquenet and Really\nMrs Lansquenet Pretending to be interested.",
    "And really bored bored  bored... And nothing to look forward to... And then  a Vermeer\nI saw in the papers that a Vermeer sold the other day for over five\nthousand pounds\n\nYou killed her  in that brutal way  for five thousand pounds Susans\nvoice was incredulous.",
    "Five thousand pounds said Poirot would have rented and equipped\na teashop...\n\nMiss Gilchrist turned to him.",
    "At least she said.",
    "You do understand.",
    "It was the only chance Id\never get.",
    "I had to have a capital sum.",
    "Her voice vibrated with the\nforce and obsession of her dream.",
    "I was going to call it the Palm Tree.",
    "And have little camels as menu holders.",
    "One can occasionally get\n\n\fquite nice china  export rejects  not that awful white utility stuff.",
    "I\nmeant to start it in some nice neighbourhood where nice people would\ncome in.",
    "I had thought of Rye... Or perhaps Chichester... Im sure I\ncould have made a success of it.",
    "She paused a minute then added\nmusingly Oak tables  and little basket chairs with striped red and\nwhite cushions \n\nFor a few moments the teashop that would never be seemed more\nreal than the Victorian solidity of the drawingroom at Enderby...",
    "It was Inspector Morton who broke the spell.",
    "Miss Gilchrist turned to him quite politely.",
    "Oh certainly she said.",
    "At once.",
    "I dont want to give any trouble Im\nsure.",
    "After all if I cant have the Palm Tree nothing really seems to\nmatter very much...\n\nShe went out of the room with him and Susan said her voice still\nshaken\n\nIve never imagined a ladylike murderer.",
    "Its horrible...\n\nChapter 25\n\nBut I dont understand about the wax flowers said Rosamund.",
    "She fixed Poirot with large reproachful blue eyes.",
    "They were at Helens flat in London.",
    "Helen herself was resting on the\nsofa and Rosamund and Poirot were having tea with her.",
    "I dont see that wax flowers had anything to do with it said\nRosamund.",
    "Or the malachite table.",
    "The malachite table no.",
    "But the wax flowers were Miss Gilchrists\nsecond mistake.",
    "She said how nice they looked on the malachite table.",
    "And you see Madame she could not have seen them there.",
    "Because\nthey had been broken and put away before she arrived with the\nTimothy Abernethies.",
    "So she could only have seen them when she was\nthere as Cora Lansquenet.",
    "That was stupid of her wasnt it said Rosamund.",
    "Poirot shook a forefinger at her.",
    "It shows you Madame the dangers of conversation.",
    "It is a profound\nbelief of mine that if you can induce a person to talk to you for long\nenough on any subject whatever sooner or later they will give\nthemselves away.",
    "Miss Gilchrist did.",
    "I shall have to be careful said Rosamund thoughtfully.",
    "Then she\nbrightened up.",
    "Did you know Im going to have a baby.",
    "Aha So that is the meaning of Harley Street and Regents Park\n\n\fYes.",
    "I was so upset you know and so surprised  that I just had to go\nsomewhere and think.",
    "You said I remember that that does not very often happen.",
    "Well its much easier not to.",
    "But this time I had to decide about the\nfuture.",
    "And Ive decided to leave the stage and just be a mother.",
    "A r\u00f4le that will suit you admirably.",
    "Already I foresee delightful\npictures in the Sketch and the Tatler.",
    "Rosamund smiled happily.",
    "Yes its wonderful.",
    "Do you know Michael is delighted.",
    "I didnt really\nthink he would be.",
    "She paused and added\n\nSusans got the malachite table.",
    "I thought as I was having a baby \n\nShe left the sentence unfinished.",
    "Susans cosmetic business promises well said Helen.",
    "I think she is\nall set for a big success.",
    "Yes she was born to succeed said Poirot.",
    "She is like her uncle.",
    "You mean Richard I suppose said Rosamund.",
    "Not Timothy\n\nAssuredly not like Timothy said Poirot.",
    "They laughed.",
    "Gregs away somewhere said Rosamund.",
    "Having a rest cure Susan\nsays\n\nShe looked inquiringly at Poirot who said nothing.",
    "I cant think why he kept on saying hed killed Uncle Richard said\nRosamund.",
    "Do you think it was a form of Exhibitionism\n\nPoirot reverted to the previous topic.",
    "I received a very amiable letter from Mr Timothy Abernethie he said.",
    "He expressed himself as highly satisfied with the services I had\nrendered the family.",
    "I do think Uncle Timothy is quite awful said Rosamund.",
    "Im going to stay with them next week said Helen.",
    "They seem to be\ngetting the gardens into order but domestic help is still difficult.",
    "They miss the awful Gilchrist I suppose said Rosamund.",
    "But I dare\nsay in the end shed have killed Uncle Timothy too.",
    "What fun if she\nhad\n\nMurder has always seemed fun to you Madame.",
    "Oh not really said Rosamund vaguely.",
    "But I did think it was\nGeorge.",
    "She brightened up.",
    "Perhaps he will do one some day.",
    "And that will be fun said Poirot sarcastically.",
    "Yes wont it Rosamund agreed.",
    "She ate another \u00e9clair from the plate in front of her.",
    "Poirot turned to Helen.",
    "And you Madame are off to Cyprus\n\nYes in a fortnights time.",
    "Then let me wish you a happy journey.",
    "He bowed over her hand.",
    "She came with him to the door leaving\nRosamund dreamily stuffing herself with cream pastries.",
    "Helen said abruptly\n\nI should like you to know M. Poirot that the legacy Richard left me\nmeant more to me than theirs did to any of the others.",
    "As much as that Madame\n\nYes.",
    "You see  there is a child in Cyprus... My husband and I were very\ndevoted it was a great sorrow to us to have no children.",
    "After he died\nmy loneliness was unbelievable.",
    "When I was nursing in London at the\nend of the war I met someone...",
    "He was younger than I was and\nmarried though not very happily.",
    "We came together for a little while.",
    "That was all.",
    "He went back to Canada  to his wife and his children.",
    "He\nnever knew about  our child.",
    "He would not have wanted it.",
    "I did.",
    "It\nseemed like a miracle to me  a middleaged woman with everything\nbehind her.",
    "With Richards money I can educate my socalled nephew\nand give him a start in life.",
    "She paused then added I never told\nRichard.",
    "He was fond of me and I of him  but he would not have\nunderstood.",
    "You know so much about us all that I thought I would like\nyou to know this about me.",
    "Once again Poirot bowed over her hand.",
    "He got home to find the armchair on the left of the fireplace occupied.",
    "Hallo Poirot said Mr Entwhistle.",
    "Ive just come back from the\nAssizes.",
    "They brought in a verdict of Guilty of course.",
    "But I shouldnt\nbe surprised if she ends up in Broadmoor.",
    "Shes gone definitely over\nthe edge since shes been in prison.",
    "Quite happy you know and most\ngracious.",
    "She spends most of her time making the most elaborate\nplans to run a chain of teashops.",
    "Her newest establishment is to be\nthe Lilac Bush.",
    "Shes opening it in Cromer.",
    "One wonders if she was always a little mad But me I think not.",
    "Good Lord no Sane as you and I when she planned that murder.",
    "Carried it out in cold blood.",
    "Shes got a good head on her you know\nunderneath the fluffy manner.",
    "Poirot gave a little shiver.",
    "I am thinking he said of some words that Susan Banks said  that\nshe had never imagined a ladylike murderer.",
    "Why not said Mr Entwhistle.",
    "It takes all sorts.",
    "They were silent  and Poirot thought of murderers he known..."
