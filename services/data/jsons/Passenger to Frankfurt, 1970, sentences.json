    "Then of course you have\nto start writing it.",
    "That\u2019s not nearly such fun\u2013it becomes hard work.",
    "Alternatively you can tuck it carefully away in storage for perhaps\nusing in a year or two years\u2019 time.\u2019\nA second question\u2013or rather a statement\u2013is then likely to be\n\u2018I suppose you take most of your characters from real life\u2019\nAn indignant denial to that monstrous suggestion.",

    "The first two come from inside\n\n\fsources but the third is outside\u2013it must be there\u2013waiting\u2013in existence\nalready.",

    "His\npresence in Sofiagrad had been due entirely to a blameless interest in the\nrarer wild flowers and to the urgencies of an elderly friend of his Lady\nLucy Cleghorn who was indefatigable in her quest for these shy floral\nrarities and who at any moment would scale a rock cliff or leap joyously\ninto a bog at the sight of some flowerlet the length of whose Latin name\nwas in inverse proportion to its size.",

    "If I can get to Geneva it will be all right.",

    "I can be safe.\u2019\n\u2018Safe\u2019 He smiled a little.",

    "A strong family resemblance.",
    "She had\nhad a slightly masculine type of face.",
    "His face perhaps had been\ncertainly in early life of a slightly effeminate type.",
    "They had both had\nthe highbridged nose the tilt of eyebrows the slightly sideways smile of\n\n\fthe lips.",
    "Pamela had been tall five foot eight he himself five foot ten.",
    "He\nlooked at the woman who had tendered him the mirror.",
    "\u2018There is a facial likeness between us that\u2019s what you mean isn\u2019t it\nBut my dear girl it wouldn\u2019t deceive anyone who knew me or knew\nyou.\u2019\n\u2018Of course it wouldn\u2019t.",

    "I am\ntravelling wearing slacks.",
    "You have been travelling with the hood of\nyour cloak drawn up round your face.",
    "All I have to do is to cut off my\nhair wrap it up in a twist of newspaper throw it in one of the litterbaskets here.",
    "Then I put on your burnous I have your boarding card\nticket and passport.",

    "\u2018I haven\u2019t seen your passport yet.",
    "I\u2019ve no idea who\nyou are.\u2019\n\u2018And yet you say I can establish my identity easily.\u2019\n\u2018I am a good judge of people.",

    "You are an important person.\u2019\n\u2018And why should I do all this\u2019\n\n\f\u2018Perhaps to save the life of a fellow human being.\u2019\n\u2018Isn\u2019t that rather a highly coloured story\u2019\n\u2018Oh yes.",
    "Quite easily not believed.",
    "Do you believe it\u2019\nHe looked at her thoughtfully.",
    "\u2018You know what you\u2019re talking like A\nbeautiful spy in a thriller.\u2019\n\u2018Yes perhaps.",
    "But I am not beautiful.\u2019\n\u2018And you\u2019re not a spy\u2019\n\u2018I might be so described perhaps.",
    "I have certain information.",
    "Information I want to preserve.",

    "She was very like Pamela.",
    "Her voice although\nforeign in intonation was like Pamela\u2019s.",
    "What she proposed was\nridiculous absurd quite impossible and probably dangerous.",
    "Dangerous\nto him.",
    "Unfortunately though that was what attracted him.",
    "To have the\nnerve to suggest such a thing to him What would come of it all It\nwould be interesting certainly to find out.",

    "Just right if I may say so.",

    "Then she was gone vanishing\nbehind him mingling with the crowd.",
    "Stafford Nye went on.",
    "He couldn\u2019t\novertake her.",
    "She did not wish to be overtaken either.",
    "He hurried on and\nhis hand held something firmly.",
    "And so at long last it seemed he came\nto the end of the bridge on the Surrey side.",
    "A few minutes later he had turned into a small caf\u00e9 and sat there\nbehind a table ordering coffee.",
    "Then he looked at what was in his hand.",
    "It was a very thin oilskin envelope.",
    "Inside it was a cheap quality white\nenvelope.",
    "That too he opened.",
    "What was inside surprised him.",
    "It was a\nticket.",
    "A ticket for the Festival Hall for the following evening.",
    "Chapter 5\nWagnerian Motif\n\nSir Stafford Nye adjusted himself more comfortably in his seat and\nlistened to the persistent hammering of the Nibelungen with which the\nprogramme began.",
    "Though he enjoyed Wagnerian opera Siegfried was by no means his\nfavourite of the operas composing the Ring.",
    "Rheingold and\nG\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung were his two preferences.",
    "The music of the young\nSiegfried listening to the songs of the birds had always for some strange\nreason irritated him instead of filling him with melodic satisfaction.",
    "It\nmight have been because he went to a performance in Munich in his\nyoung days which had displayed a magnificent tenor of unfortunately\novermagnificent proportions and he had been too young to divorce the\njoy of music from the visual joy of seeing a young Siegfried that looked\neven passably young.",
    "The fact of an outsized tenor rolling about on the\nground in an access of boyishness had revolted him.",
    "He was also not\nparticularly fond of birds and forest murmurs.",
    "No give him the Rhine\nMaidens every time although in Munich even the Rhine Maidens in\nthose days had been of fairly solid proportions.",
    "But that mattered less.",
    "Carried away by the melodic flow of water and the joyous impersonal\nsong he had not allowed visual appreciation to matter.",
    "From time to time he looked about him casually.",
    "He had taken his seat\nfairly early.",
    "It was a full house as it usually was.",
    "The intermission came.",
    "Sir Stafford rose and looked about him.",
    "The seat beside his had remained\nempty.",
    "Someone who was supposed to have arrived had not arrived.",
    "Was\nthat the answer or was it merely a case of being excluded because\nsomeone had arrived late which practice still held on the occasions when\nWagnerian music was listened to.",
    "He went out strolled about drank a cup of coffee smoked a cigarette\nand returned when the summons came.",
    "This time as he drew near he\nsaw that the seat next to his was filled.",
    "Immediately his excitement\nreturned.",
    "He regained his seat and sat down.",
    "Yes it was the woman of\nthe Frankfurt Air Lounge.",
    "She did not look at him she was looking\nstraight ahead.",
    "Her face in profile was as cleancut and pure as he\n\n\fremembered it.",
    "Her head turned slightly and her eyes passed over him\nbut without recognition.",
    "So intent was that nonrecognition that it was as\ngood as a word spoken.",
    "This was a meeting that was not to be\nacknowledged.",
    "Not now at any event.",
    "The lights began to dim.",
    "The\nwoman beside him turned.",
    "\u2018Excuse me could I look at your programme I have dropped mine\nI\u2019m afraid coming to my seat.\u2019\n\u2018Of course\u2019 he said.",
    "He handed over the programme and she took it from him.",
    "She opened\nit studied the items.",
    "The lights went lower.",
    "The second half of the\nprogramme began.",
    "It started with the overture to Lohengrin.",
    "At the end\nof it she handed back the programme to him with a few words of thanks.",
    "\u2018Thank you so much.",
    "It was very kind of you.\u2019\nThe next item was the Siegfried forest murmur music.",
    "He consulted\nthe programme she had returned to him.",
    "It was then that he noticed\nsomething faintly pencilled at the foot of a page.",
    "He did not attempt to\nread it now.",
    "Indeed the light would have not been sufficient.",
    "He merely\nclosed the programme and held it.",
    "He had not he was quite sure written\nanything there himself.",
    "Not that is in his own programme.",
    "She had he\nthought had her own programme ready folded perhaps in her handbag\nand had already written some message ready to pass to him.",
    "Altogether\nit seemed to him there was still that atmosphere of secrecy of danger.",
    "The meeting on Hungerford Bridge and the envelope with the ticket\nforced into his hand.",
    "And now the silent woman who sat beside him.",
    "He\nglanced at her once or twice with the quick careless glance that one\ngives to a stranger sitting next to one.",
    "She lolled back in her seat her\nhighnecked dress was of dull black cr\u00eape an antique torque of gold\nencircled her neck.",
    "Her dark hair was cropped closely and shaped to her\nhead.",
    "She did not glance at him or return any look.",
    "He wondered.",
    "Was\nthere someone in the seats of the Festival Hall watching her\u2013or watching\nhim Noting whether they looked or spoke to each other Presumably\nthere must be or there must be at least the possibility of such a thing.",
    "She had answered his appeal in the newspaper advertisement.",
    "Let that be\nenough for him.",
    "His curiosity was unimpaired but he did at least know\nnow that Daphne Theodofanous\u2013alias Mary Ann\u2013was here in London.",
    "There were possibilities in the future of his learning more of what was\nafoot.",
    "But the plan of campaign must be left to her.",
    "He must follow her\nlead.",
    "As he had obeyed her in the airport so he would obey her now\nand\u2013let him admit it\u2013life had become suddenly more interesting.",
    "This\nwas better than the boring conferences of his political life.",
    "Had a car\n\n\freally tried to run him down the other night He thought it had.",
    "Two\nattempts\u2013not only one.",
    "It was easy enough to imagine that one was the\ntarget of assault people drove so recklessly nowadays that you could\neasily fancy malice aforethought when it was not so.",
    "He folded his\nprogramme did not look at it again.",
    "The music came to its end.",
    "The\nwoman next to him spoke.",
    "She did not turn her head or appear to speak\nto him but she spoke aloud with a little sigh between the words as\nthough she was communing with herself or possibly to her neighbour on\nthe other side.",
    "\u2018The young Siegfried\u2019 she said and sighed again.",
    "The programme ended with the March from Die Meistersinger.",
    "After\nenthusiastic applause people began to leave their seats.",
    "He waited to see\nif she would give him any lead but she did not.",
    "She gathered up her\nwrap moved out of the row of chairs and with a slightly accelerated\nstep moved along with other people and disappeared in the crowd.",
    "Stafford Nye regained his car and drove home.",
    "Arrived there he\nspread out the Festival Hall programme on his desk and examined it\ncarefully after putting the coffee to percolate.",
    "The programme was disappointing to say the least of it.",
    "There did not\nappear to be any message inside.",
    "Only on one page above the list of the\nitems were the pencil marks that he had vaguely observed.",
    "But they\nwere not words or letters or even figures.",
    "They appeared to be merely a\nmusical notation.",
    "It was as though someone had scribbled a phrase of\nmusic with a somewhat inadequate pencil.",
    "For a moment it occurred to\nStafford Nye there might perhaps be a secret message he could bring out\nby applying heat.",
    "Rather gingerly and in a way rather ashamed of his\nmelodramatic fancy he held it towards the bar of the electric fire but\nnothing resulted.",
    "With a sigh he tossed the programme back on to the\ntable.",
    "But he felt justifiably annoyed.",
    "All this rigmarole a rendezvous on\na windy and rainy bridge overlooking the river Sitting through a concert\nby the side of a woman of whom he yearned to ask at least a dozen\nquestions\u2013and at the end of it Nothing No further on.",
    "Still she had met\nhim.",
    "But why If she didn\u2019t want to speak to him to make further\narrangements with him why had she come at all\nHis eyes passed idly across the room to his bookcase which he\nreserved for various thrillers works of detective fiction and an\noccasional volume of science fiction he shook his head.",
    "Fiction he\nthought was infinitely superior to real life.",
    "Dead bodies mysterious\ntelephone calls beautiful foreign spies in profusion However this\nparticular elusive lady might not have done with him yet.",
    "Next time he\n\n\fthought he would make some arrangements of his own.",
    "Two could play\nat the game that she was playing.",
    "He pushed aside the programme and drank another cup of coffee and\nwent to the window.",
    "He had the programme still in his hand.",
    "As he\nlooked out towards the street below his eyes fell back again on the open\nprogramme in his hand and he hummed to himself almost\nunconsciously.",
    "He had a good ear for music and he could hum the notes\nthat were scrawled there quite easily.",
    "Vaguely they sounded familiar as\nhe hummed them.",
    "He increased his voice a little.",
    "What was it now Tum\ntum tum tum titum.",
    "Tum.",
    "Yes definitely familiar.",
    "He started opening his letters.",
    "They were mostly uninteresting.",
    "A couple of invitations one from the\nAmerican Embassy one from Lady Athelhampton a Charity Variety\nperformance which Royalty would attend and for which it was suggested\nfive guineas would not be an exorbitant fee to obtain a seat.",
    "He threw\nthem aside lightly.",
    "He doubted very much whether he wished to accept\nany of them.",
    "He decided that instead of remaining in London he would\nwithout more ado go and see his Aunt Matilda as he had promised.",
    "He\nwas fond of his Aunt Matilda though he did not visit her very often.",
    "She\nlived in a rehabilitated apartment consisting of a series of rooms in one\nwing of a large Georgian manor house in the country which she had\ninherited from his grandfather.",
    "She had a large beautifully proportioned\nsittingroom a small oval diningroom a new kitchen made from the old\nhousekeeper\u2019s room two bedrooms for guests a large comfortable\nbedroom for herself with an adjoining bathroom and adequate quarters\nfor a patient companion who shared her daily life.",
    "The remains of a\nfaithful domestic staff were well provided for and housed.",
    "The rest of the\nhouse remained under dust sheets with periodical cleaning.",
    "Stafford Nye\nwas fond of the place having spent holidays there as a boy.",
    "It had been a\ngay house then.",
    "His eldest uncle had lived there with his wife and their\ntwo children.",
    "Yes it had been pleasant there then.",
    "There had been money\nand a sufficient staff to run it.",
    "He had not specially noticed in those days\nthe portraits and pictures.",
    "There had been largesized examples of\nVictorian art occupying pride of place\u2013overcrowding the walls but there\nhad been other masters of an older age.",
    "Yes there had been some good\nportraits there.",
    "A Raeburn two Lawrences a Gainsborough a Lely two\nrather dubious Vandykes.",
    "A couple of Turners too.",
    "Some of them had\nhad to be sold to provide the family with money.",
    "He still enjoyed when\nvisiting there strolling about and studying the family pictures.",
    "His Aunt Matilda was a great chatterbox but she always enjoyed his\nvisits.",
    "He was fond of her in a desultory way but he was not quite sure\nwhy it was that he had suddenly wanted to visit her now.",
    "And what it\nwas that had brought family portraits into his mind Could it have been\nbecause there was a portrait of his sister Pamela by one of the leading\nartists of the day twenty years ago.",
    "He would like to see that portrait of\nPamela and look at it more closely.",
    "See how close the resemblance had\nbeen between the stranger who had disrupted his life in this really\noutrageous fashion and his sister.",
    "He picked up the Festival Hall programme again with some irritation\nand began to hum the pencilled notes.",
    "Tum tum ti tum\u2013Then it came to\nhim and he knew what it was.",
    "It was the Siegfried motif.",
    "Siegfried\u2019s\nHorn.",
    "The Young Siegfried motif.",
    "That was what the woman had said\nlast night.",
    "Not apparently to him not apparently to anybody.",
    "But it had\nbeen the message a message that would have meant nothing to anyone\naround since it would have seemed to refer to the music that had just\nbeen played.",
    "And the motif had been written on his programme also in\nmusical terms.",
    "The Young Siegfried.",
    "It must have meant something.",
    "Well perhaps further enlightenment would come.",
    "The Young Siegfried.",
    "What the hell did that mean Why and how and when and what\nRidiculous All those questioning words.",
    "He rang the telephone and obtained Aunt Matilda\u2019s number.",
    "\u2018But of course Staffy dear it will be lovely to have you.",
    "Take the\nfourthirty train.",
    "It still runs you know but it gets here an hour and a half\nlater.",
    "And it leaves Paddington later\u2013fivefifteen.",
    "That\u2019s what they mean\nby improving the railways I suppose.",
    "Stops at several most absurd\nstations on the way.",
    "All right.",
    "Horace will meet you at King\u2019s Marston.\u2019\n\u2018He\u2019s still there then\u2019\n\u2018Of course he\u2019s still there.\u2019\n\u2018I suppose he is\u2019 said Sir Stafford Nye.",
    "Horace once a groom then a coachman had survived as a chauffeur\nand apparently was still surviving.",
    "\u2018He must be at least eighty\u2019 said Sir\nStafford.",
    "He smiled to himself.",
    "Chapter 6\nPortrait Of A Lady\n\nI\n\u2018You look very nice and brown dear\u2019 said Aunt Matilda surveying him\nappreciatively.",
    "\u2018That\u2019s Malaya I suppose.",
    "If it was Malaya you went to\nOr was it Siam or Thailand They change the names of all these places\nand really it makes it very difficult.",
    "Anyway it wasn\u2019t Vietnam was it\nYou know I don\u2019t like the sound of Vietnam at all.",
    "It\u2019s all very\nconfusing North Vietnam and South Vietnam and the VietCong and the\nViet\u2013whatever the other thing is and all wanting to fight each other and\nnobody wanting to stop.",
    "They won\u2019t go to Paris or wherever it is and sit\nround tables and talk sensibly.",
    "Don\u2019t you think really dear\u2013I\u2019ve been\nthinking it over and I thought it would be a very nice solution\u2013couldn\u2019t\nyou make a lot of football fields and then they could all go and fight each\nother there but with less lethal weapons.",
    "Not that nasty palm burning\nstuff.",
    "You know.",
    "Just hit each other and punch each other and all that.",
    "They\u2019d enjoy it everyone would enjoy it and you could charge\nadmission for people to go and see them do it.",
    "I do think really that we\ndon\u2019t understand giving people the things they really want.\u2019\n\u2018I think it\u2019s a very fine idea of yours Aunt Matilda\u2019 said Sir Stafford\nNye as he kissed a pleasantly perfumed pale pink wrinkled cheek.",
    "\u2018And\nhow are you my dear\u2019\n\u2018Well I\u2019m old\u2019 said Lady Matilda Cleckheaton.",
    "\u2018Yes I\u2019m old.",
    "Of\ncourse you don\u2019t know what it is to be old.",
    "If it isn\u2019t one thing it\u2019s\nanother.",
    "Rheumatism or arthritis or a nasty bit of asthma or a sore throat\nor an ankle you\u2019ve turned.",
    "Always something you know.",
    "Nothing very\nimportant.",
    "But there it is.",
    "Why have you come to see me dear\u2019\nSir Stafford was slightly taken aback by the directness of the query.",
    "\u2018I usually come and see you when I return from a trip abroad.\u2019\n\u2018You\u2019ll have to come one chair nearer\u2019 said Aunt Matilda.",
    "\u2018I\u2019m just\nthat bit deafer since you saw me last.",
    "You look different\u2026Why do you\nlook different\u2019\n\u2018Because I\u2019m more sunburnt.",
    "You said so.\u2019\n\n\f\u2018Nonsense that\u2019s not what I mean at all.",
    "Don\u2019t tell me it\u2019s a girl at\nlast.\u2019\n\u2018A girl\u2019\n\u2018Well I\u2019ve always felt it might be one some day.",
    "The trouble is you\u2019ve\ngot too much sense of humour.\u2019\n\u2018Now why should you think that\u2019\n\u2018Well it\u2019s what people do think about you.",
    "Oh yes they do.",
    "Your\nsense of humour is in the way of your career too.",
    "You know you\u2019re all\nmixed up with all these people.",
    "Diplomatic and political.",
    "What they call\nyounger statesmen and elder statesmen and middle statesmen too.",
    "And\nall those different Parties.",
    "Really I think it\u2019s too silly to have too many\nParties.",
    "First of all those awful awful Labour people.\u2019 She raised her\nConservative nose into the air.",
    "\u2018Why when I was a girl there wasn\u2019t such\na thing as a Labour Party.",
    "Nobody would have known what you meant\nby it.",
    "They\u2019d have said \u201cnonsense\u201d.",
    "Pity it wasn\u2019t nonsense too.",
    "And\nthen there\u2019s the Liberals of course but they\u2019re terribly wet.",
    "And then\nthere are the Tories or the Conservatives as they call themselves again\nnow.\u2019\n\u2018And what\u2019s the matter with them\u2019 asked Stafford Nye smiling\nslightly.",
    "\u2018Too many earnest women.",
    "Makes them lack gaiety you know.\u2019\n\u2018Oh well no political party goes in for gaiety much nowadays.\u2019\n\u2018Just so\u2019 said Aunt Matilda.",
    "\u2018And then of course that\u2019s where you go\nwrong.",
    "You want to cheer things up.",
    "You want to have a little gaiety and\nso you make a little gentle fun at people and of course they don\u2019t like it.",
    "They say \u201cCe n\u2019est pas un gar\u00e7on s\u00e9rieux\u201d like that man in the fishing.\u2019\nSir Stafford Nye laughed.",

    "\u2018What are you looking at\u2019 said Lady Matilda.",
    "\u2018Your pictures.\u2019\n\u2018You don\u2019t want me to sell them do you Everyone seems to be\nselling their pictures nowadays.",
    "Old Lord Grampion you know.",
    "He sold\nhis Turners and he sold some of his ancestors as well.",
    "And Geoffrey\nGouldman.",
    "All those lovely horses of his.",
    "By Stubbs weren\u2019t they\nSomething like that.",
    "Really the prices one gets\n\u2018But I don\u2019t want to sell my pictures.",
    "I like them.",
    "Most of them in this\nroom have a real interest because they\u2019re ancestors.",
    "I know nobody\nwants ancestors nowadays but then I\u2019m oldfashioned.",
    "I like ancestors.",
    "My own ancestors I mean.",
    "What are you looking at Pamela\u2019\n\u2018Yes I was.",
    "I was thinking about her the other day.\u2019\n\n\f\u2018Astonishing how alike you two are.",
    "I mean it\u2019s not even as though\nyou were twins though they say that different sex twins even if they are\ntwins can\u2019t be identical if you know what I mean.\u2019\n\u2018So Shakespeare must have made rather a mistake over Viola and\nSebastian.\u2019\n\u2018Well ordinary brothers and sisters can be alike can\u2019t they You and\nPamela were always very alike\u2013to look at I mean.\u2019\n\u2018Not in any other way Don\u2019t you think we were alike in character\u2019\n\u2018No not in the least.",
    "That\u2019s the funny part of it.",
    "But of course you and\nPamela have what I call the family face.",
    "Not a Nye face.",
    "I mean the\nBaldwenWhite face.\u2019\nSir Stafford Nye had never quite been able to compete when it came\ndown to talking on a question of genealogy with his greataunt.",
    "\u2018I\u2019ve always thought that you and Pamela both took after Alexa\u2019 she\nwent on.",
    "\u2018Which was Alexa\u2019\n\u2018Your greatgreat\u2013I think one more great\u2013grandmother.",
    "Hungarian.",
    "A\nHungarian countess or baroness or something.",
    "Your greatgreatgrandfather fell in love with her when he was at Vienna in the Embassy.",
    "Yes.",
    "Hungarian.",
    "That\u2019s what she was.",
    "Very sporting too.",
    "They are\nsporting you know Hungarians.",
    "She rode to hounds rode\nmagnificently.\u2019\n\u2018Is she in the picture gallery\u2019\n\u2018She\u2019s on the first landing.",
    "Just over the head of the stairs a little to\nthe right.\u2019\n\u2018I must go and look at her when I go to bed.\u2019\n\u2018Why don\u2019t you go and look at her now and then you can come back\nand talk about her.\u2019\n\u2018I will if you like.\u2019 He smiled at her.",
    "He ran out of the room and up the staircase.",
    "Yes she had a sharp eye\nold Matilda.",
    "That was the face.",
    "That was the face that he had seen and\nremembered.",
    "Remembered not for its likeness to himself not even for its\nlikeness to Pamela but for a closer resemblance still to this picture here.",
    "A handsome girl brought home by his Ambassador greatgreatgreatgrandfather if that was enough greats.",
    "Aunt Matilda was never satisfied\nwith only a few.",
    "About twenty she had been.",
    "She had come here and\nbeen highspirited and rode a horse magnificently and danced divinely\nand men had fallen in love with her.",
    "But she had been faithful so it was\nalways said to greatgreatgreatgrandfather a very steady and sober\nmember of the Diplomatic Service.",
    "She had gone with him to foreign\n\n\fEmbassies and returned here and had had children\u2013three or four children\nhe believed.",
    "Through one of those children the inheritance of her face\nher nose the turn of her neck had been passed down to him and to his\nsister Pamela.",
    "He wondered if the young woman who had doped his\nbeer and forced him to lend her his cloak and who had depicted herself\nas being in danger of death unless he did what she asked had been\npossibly related as a fifth or sixth cousin removed a descendant of the\nwoman pictured on the wall at which he looked.",
    "Well it could be.",
    "They\nhad been of the same nationality perhaps.",
    "Anyway their faces had\nresembled each other a good deal.",
    "How upright she\u2019d sat at the opera\nhow straight that profile the thin slightly arched aquiline nose.",
    "And the\natmosphere that hung about her.",
    "II\n\u2018Find it\u2019 asked Lady Matilda when her nephew returned to the white\ndrawingroom as her sittingroom was usually called.",
    "\u2018Interesting face\nisn\u2019t it\u2019\n\u2018Yes quite handsome too.\u2019\n\u2018It\u2019s much better to be interesting than handsome.",
    "But you haven\u2019t\nbeen in Hungary or Austria have you You wouldn\u2019t meet anyone like\nher out in Malaya She wouldn\u2019t be sitting around a table there making\nlittle notes or correcting speeches or things like that.",
    "She was a wild\ncreature by all accounts.",
    "Lovely manners and all the rest of it.",
    "But wild.",
    "Wild as a wild bird.",
    "She didn\u2019t know what danger was.\u2019\n\u2018How do you know so much about her\u2019\n\u2018Oh I agree I wasn\u2019t a contemporary of hers I wasn\u2019t born until\nseveral years after she was dead.",
    "All the same I\u2019ve always been\ninterested in her.",
    "She was adventurous you know.",
    "Very adventurous.",
    "Very queer stories were told about her about things she was mixed up\nin.\u2019\n\u2018And how did my greatgreatgreatgrandfather react to that\u2019\n\u2018I expect it worried him to death\u2019 said Lady Matilda.",
    "\u2018They say he\nwas devoted to her though.",
    "By the way Staffy did you ever read The\nPrisoner of Zenda\u2019\n\u2018Prisoner of Zenda Sounds very familiar.\u2019\n\u2018Well of course it\u2019s familiar it\u2019s a book.\u2019\n\u2018Yes yes I realize it\u2019s a book.\u2019\n\u2018You wouldn\u2019t know about it I expect.",

    "This was something planned beforehand.",
    "Reasonable nothing doubtful\nor unexpected about it.",

    "\u2018Takes money to\nkeep these places up and in good order.",
    "I should say this was a\ncomfortable house to live in.\u2019\n\u2018Comfortable but not beautiful.",
    "The man who lives in it prefers\ncomfort to beauty I should say.\u2019\n\u2018Perhaps wisely\u2019 said Sir Stafford.",
    "\u2018And yet in some ways he is very\nappreciative of beauty of some kinds of beauty.\u2019\nThey drew up before the welllighted porch.",

    "We\u2019ll telephone down in the morning.\u2019\n\u2018Good night.",
    "Good night sir.\u2019\nThere were footsteps inside and the door was flung open.",
    "Sir Stafford\nhad expected some kind of butler but instead there was a tall grenadier\nof a parlourmaid.",
    "Greyhaired tightlipped eminently reliable and\ncompetent he thought.",
    "An invaluable asset and hard to find nowadays.",
    "Trustworthy capable of being fierce.",
    "\u2018I am afraid we are a little late\u2019 said Renata.",

    "He heard the door shut quietly behind him.",
    "There were four people in the room.",
    "Sitting behind a large desk which\nwas well covered with papers documents an open map or two and\npresumably other papers which were in the course of discussion was a\nlarge fat man with a very yellow face.",
    "It was a face Sir Stafford Nye had\nseen before though he could not for the moment attach the proper name\nto it.",
    "It was a man whom he had met only in a casual fashion and yet the\noccasion had been an important one.",
    "He should know yes definitely he\nshould know.",
    "But why\u2013why wouldn\u2019t the name come\nWith a slight struggle the figure sitting at the desk rose to his feet.",
    "He\ntook the Countess Renata\u2019s outstretched hand.",
    "\u2018You\u2019ve arrived\u2019 he said \u2018splendid.\u2019\n\u2018Yes.",
    "Let me introduce you though I think you already know him.",
    "Sir\nStafford Nye Mr Robinson.\u2019\nOf course.",
    "In Sir Stafford Nye\u2019s brain something clicked like a\ncamera.",
    "That fitted in too with another name.",
    "Pikeaway.",
    "To say that he\nknew all about Mr Robinson was not true.",
    "He knew about Mr Robinson\nall that Mr Robinson permitted to be known.",
    "His name as far as anyone\nknew was Robinson though it might have been any name of foreign\norigin.",
    "No one had ever suggested anything of that kind.",
    "Recognition\ncame also of his personal appearance.",
    "The high forehead the melancholy\ndark eyes the large generous mouth and the impressive white teeth\u2013\n\n\ffalse teeth presumably but at any rate teeth of which it might have been\nsaid like in Red Riding Hood \u2018the better to eat you with child\u2019\nHe knew too what Mr Robinson stood for.",
    "Just one simple word\ndescribed it.",
    "Mr Robinson represented Money with a capital M. Money\nin its every aspect.",
    "International money worldwide money private\nhome finances banking money not in the way that the average person\nlooked at it.",
    "You never thought of him as a very rich man.",
    "Undoubtedly\nhe was a very rich man but that wasn\u2019t the important thing.",
    "He was one\nof the arrangers of money the great clan of bankers.",
    "His personal tastes\nmight even have been simple but Sir Stafford Nye doubted if they were.",
    "A reasonable standard of comfort even luxury would be Mr Robinson\u2019s\nway of life.",
    "But not more than that.",
    "So behind all this mysterious\nbusiness there was the power of money.",
    "\u2018I heard of you just a day or two ago\u2019 said Mr Robinson as he shook\nhands \u2018from our friend Pikeaway you know.\u2019\nThat fitted in thought Stafford Nye because now he remembered that\non the solitary occasion before that he had met Mr Robinson Colonel\nPikeaway had been present.",
    "Horsham he remembered had spoken of Mr\nRobinson.",
    "So now there was Mary Ann or the Countess Zerkowski\nand Colonel Pikeaway sitting in his own smokefilled room with his eyes\nhalf closed either going to sleep or just waking up and there was Mr\nRobinson with his large yellow face and so there was money at stake\nsomewhere and his glance shifted to the three other people in the room\nbecause he wanted to see if he knew who they were and what they\nrepresented or if he could guess.",
    "In two cases at least he didn\u2019t need to guess.",
    "The man who sat in the\ntall porter\u2019s chair by the fireplace an elderly figure framed by the chair\nas a picture frame might have framed him was a face that had been well\nknown all over England.",
    "Indeed it still was well known although it was\nvery seldom seen nowadays.",
    "A sick man an invalid a man who made\nvery brief appearances and then it was said at physical cost to himself\nin pain and difficulty.",
    "Lord Altamount.",
    "A thin emaciated face\noutstanding nose grey hair which receded just a little from the forehead\nand then flowed back in a thick grey mane somewhat prominent ears\nthat cartoonists had used in their time and a deep piercing glance that\nnot so much observed as probed.",
    "Probed deeply into what it was looking\nat.",
    "At the moment it was looking at Sir Stafford Nye.",
    "He stretched out a\nhand as Stafford Nye went towards him.",
    "\u2018I don\u2019t get up\u2019 said Lord Altamount.",
    "His voice was faint an old\nman\u2019s voice a faraway voice.",
    "\u2018My back doesn\u2019t allow me.",
    "Just come\n\n\fback from Malaya haven\u2019t you Stafford Nye\u2019\n\u2018Yes.\u2019\n\u2018Was it worth your going I expect you think it wasn\u2019t.",
    "You\u2019re\nprobably right too.",
    "Still we have to have these excrescences in life\nthese ornamental trimmings to adorn the better kind of diplomatic lies.",
    "I\u2019m glad you could come here or were brought here tonight.",
    "Mary Ann\u2019s\ndoing I suppose\u2019\nSo that\u2019s what he calls her and thinks of her as thought Stafford Nye\nto himself.",
    "It was what Horsham had called her.",
    "She was in with them\nthen without a doubt.",
    "As for Altamount he stood for\u2013what did he stand\nfor nowadays Stafford Nye thought to himself.",
    "He stands for England.",
    "He still stands for England until he\u2019s buried in Westminster Abbey or a\ncountry mausoleum whatever he chooses.",
    "He has been England and he\nknows England and I should say he knows the value of every politician\nand government official in England pretty well even if he\u2019s never\nspoken to them.",
    "Lord Altamount said\n\u2018This is our colleague Sir James Kleek.\u2019\nStafford Nye didn\u2019t know Kleek.",
    "He didn\u2019t think he\u2019d even heard of\nhim.",
    "A restless fidgety type.",
    "Sharp suspicious glances that never rested\nanywhere for long.",
    "He had the contained eagerness of a sporting dog\nawaiting the word of command.",
    "Ready to start off at a glance from his\nmaster\u2019s eye.",
    "But who was his master Altamount or Robinson\nStafford\u2019s eye went round to the fourth man.",
    "He had risen to his feet\nfrom the chair where he had been sitting close to the door.",
    "Bushy\nmoustache raised eyebrows watchful withdrawn managing in some\nway to remain familiar yet almost unrecognizable.",
    "\u2018So it\u2019s you\u2019 said Sir Stafford Nye \u2018how are you Horsham\u2019\n\u2018Very pleased to see you here Sir Stafford.\u2019\nQuite a representative gathering Stafford Nye thought with a swift\nglance round.",
    "They had set a chair for Renata not far from the fire and Lord\nAltamount.",
    "She had stretched out a hand\u2013her left hand he noticed\u2013and\nhe had taken it between his two hands holding it for a minute then\ndropping it.",
    "He said\n\u2018You took risks child you take too many risks.\u2019\nLooking at him she said \u2018It was you who taught me that and it\u2019s the\nonly way of life.\u2019\nLord Altamount turned his head towards Sir Stafford Nye.",
    "\u2018It wasn\u2019t I who taught you to choose your man.",
    "You\u2019ve got a natural\ngenius for that.\u2019 Looking at Stafford Nye he said \u2018I know your greataunt or your greatgreataunt is she\u2019\n\u2018GreatAunt Matilda\u2019 said Stafford Nye immediately.",
    "\u2018Yes.",
    "That\u2019s the one.",
    "One of the Victorian toursdeforce of the\n\u2019nineties.",
    "She must be nearly ninety herself now.\u2019\nHe went on\n\u2018I don\u2019t see her very often.",
    "Once or twice a year perhaps.",
    "But it strikes\nme every time\u2013that sheer vitality of hers that outlives her bodily strength.",
    "They have the secret of that those indomitable Victorians and some of\nthe Edwardians as well.\u2019\nSir James Kleek said \u2018Let me get you a drink Nye What will you\nhave\u2019\n\u2018Gin and tonic if I may.\u2019\nThe Countess refused with a small shake of the head.",
    "James Kleek brought Nye his drink and set it on the table near Mr\nRobinson.",
    "Stafford Nye was not going to speak first.",
    "The dark eyes\nbehind the desk lost their melancholy for a moment.",
    "They had quite\nsuddenly a twinkle in them.",
    "\u2018Any questions\u2019 he said.",
    "\u2018Too many\u2019 said Sir Stafford Nye.",
    "\u2018Wouldn\u2019t it be better to have\nexplanations first questions later\u2019\n\u2018Is that what you\u2019d like\u2019\n\u2018It might simplify matters.\u2019\n\u2018Well we start with a few plain statements of facts.",
    "You may or you\nmay not have been asked to come here.",
    "If not that fact may rankle\nslightly.\u2019\n\u2018He prefers to be asked always\u2019 said the Countess.",
    "\u2018He said as much\nto me.\u2019\n\u2018Naturally\u2019 said Mr Robinson.",
    "\u2018I was hijacked\u2019 said Stafford Nye.",
    "\u2018Very fashionable I know.",
    "One of\nour more modern methods.\u2019\nHe kept his tone one of light amusement.",
    "\u2018Which invites surely a question from you\u2019 said Mr Robinson.",
    "\u2018Just one small word of three letters.",
    "Why\u2019\n\u2018Quite so.",
    "Why I admire your economy of speech.",
    "This is a private\ncommittee\u2013a committee of inquiry.",
    "An inquiry of worldwide\nsignificance.\u2019\n\u2018Sounds interesting\u2019 said Sir Stafford Nye.",
    "\u2018It is more than interesting.",
    "It is poignant and immediate.",
    "Four\ndifferent ways of life are represented in this room tonight\u2019 said Lord\nAltamount.",
    "\u2018We represent different branches.",
    "I have retired from active\nparticipation in the affairs of this country but I am still a consulting\nauthority.",

    "He is my righthand man.",
    "He is also our spokesman.",
    "Explain the\ngeneral setout if you will Jamie to Sir Stafford here.\u2019\nIt seemed to Stafford Nye that the gun dog quivered.",
    "At last At last I\ncan speak and get on with it He leaned forward a little in his chair.",
    "\u2018If things happen in the world you have to look for a cause for them.",

    "It\u2019s always been the same way.",
    "You take a\nnatural force a great fall of water that will give you turbine power.",
    "You\ntake the discovery of uranium from pitchblende and that will give you in\ndue course nuclear power that had not been dreamt of or known.",
    "When\nyou found coal and minerals they gave you transport power energy.",
    "There are forces at work always that give you certain things.",
    "But behind\neach of them there is someone who controls it.",
    "You\u2019ve got to find who\u2019s\ncontrolling the powers that are slowly gaining ascendancy in practically\nevery country in Europe further afield still in parts of Asia.",
    "Less\npossibly in Africa but again in the American continents both north and\nsouth.",
    "You\u2019ve got to get behind the things that are happening and find\nout the motive force that\u2019s making them happen.",
    "One thing that makes\nthings happen is money.\u2019\nHe nodded towards Mr Robinson.",
    "\u2018Mr Robinson there knows as much about money as anybody in the\nworld I suppose.\u2019\n\u2018It\u2019s quite simple\u2019 said Mr Robinson.",
    "\u2018There are big movements afoot.",
    "There has to be money behind them.",
    "We\u2019ve got to find out where that\nmoney\u2019s coming from.",
    "Who\u2019s operating with it Where do they get it\nfrom Where are they sending it to Why It\u2019s quite true what James\nsays I know a lot about money As much as any man alive knows today.",
    "Then there are what you might call trends.",
    "It\u2019s a word we use a good deal\nnowadays Trends or tendencies\u2013there are innumerable words one uses.",
    "They mean not quite the same thing but they\u2019re in relationship with each\nother.",
    "A tendency shall we say to rebellion shows up.",
    "Look back\nthrough history.",
    "You\u2019ll find it coming again and again repeating itself\n\n\flike a periodic table repeating a pattern.",
    "A desire for rebellion the\nmeans of rebellion the form the rebellion takes.",
    "It\u2019s not a thing particular\nto any particular country.",

    "\u2018That\u2019s the way you more or less\nput it to me.\u2019\n\u2018Yes you\u2019re expressing things very well James.\u2019\n\u2018It\u2019s a pattern a pattern that arises and seems inevitable.",
    "You can\nrecognize it where you find it.",

    "All over Europe people embarked in\nships they went off to deliver the Holy Land.",
    "All quite clear a perfectly\ngood pattern of determined behaviour.",
    "But why did they go That\u2019s the\ninterest of history you know.",
    "Seeing why these desires and patterns\narise.",
    "It\u2019s not always a materialistic answer either.",
    "All sorts of things can\ncause rebellion a desire for freedom freedom of speech freedom of\nreligious worship again a series of closely related patterns.",
    "It led people\nto embrace emigration to other countries to formation of new religions\nvery often as full of tyranny as the forms of religion they had left behind.",
    "But in all this if you look hard enough if you make enough\ninvestigations you can see what started the onset of these and many\nother\u2013I\u2019ll use the same word\u2013patterns.",
    "In some ways it\u2019s like a virus\ndisease.",
    "The virus can be carried\u2013round the world across seas up\nmountains.",
    "It can go and infect.",
    "It goes apparently without being set in\nmotion.",
    "But one can\u2019t be sure even now that that was always really true.",
    "There could have been causes.",
    "Causes that made things happen.",
    "One can\ngo a few steps further.",
    "There are people.",
    "One person\u2013ten persons\u2013a few\nhundred persons who are capable of being and setting in motion a cause.",
    "So it is not the end process that one has to look at.",
    "It is the first people\nwho set the cause in motion.",
    "You have your crusaders you have your\nreligious enthusiasts you have your desires for liberty you have all the\nother patterns but you\u2019ve got to go further back still.",
    "Further back to a\nhinterland.",
    "Visions dreams.",
    "The prophet Joel knew it when he wrote\n\u201cYour old men shall dream dreams your young men shall see visions.\u201d\nAnd of those two which are the more powerful Dreams are not\ndestructive.",

    "Why was everyone so impressed And so she went.",

    "I wouldn\u2019t have believed it.",
    "Of course I don\u2019t\nunderstand German very well but I was carried away too.",
    "And I see now\nwhy everyone is.",
    "I mean his ideas were wonderful\u2026They inflamed you.",
    "The things he said.",
    "I mean you just felt there was no other way of\nthinking that a whole new world would happen if only one followed\nhim.",
    "Oh I can\u2019t explain properly.",
    "I\u2019m going to write down as much as I\ncan remember and then if I bring it to you to see you\u2019ll see better than\nmy just trying to tell you the effect it had.\u201d\n\u2018I told her that was a very good idea.",
    "She came to me the next day and\nshe said \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019ll believe this.",
    "I started to write down the\nthings I\u2019d heard the things Hitler had said.",

    "By their personal magnetism perhaps a\ntone of voice perhaps some emanation that comes forth straight from the\nflesh.",
    "I don\u2019t know but it exists.",

    "\u2018Things that sound\nexaggerated are very often not exaggerated at all.",

    "And therefore\nthey come to you as so unfamiliar that you can hardly do anything about\nthem except accept them.",

    "At Mr\nRobinson impassively yellowfaced with his mouthful of teeth\ndisplayed to Sir James Kleek a somewhat brash talker Sir Stafford Nye\nhad considered him but nevertheless he had obviously his uses Master\u2019s\ndog he called him in his own mind.",
    "He looked at Lord Altamount the\nhood of the porter\u2019s chair framed round his head.",
    "The lighting was not\nstrong in the room.",
    "It gave him the look of a saint in a niche in a\ncathedral somewhere.",
    "Ascetic.",

    "A great man.",
    "Yes\nAltamount had been one of the great men of the past.",

    "Pah It makes the old Bayreuth Festival Hall look\nlike a comprehensive school Do you know what it cost to build that\nOpera House\u2019\nShe mentioned a sum in millions of marks.",
    "It quite took Stafford\nNye\u2019s breath away but he was under no necessity to conceal that.",
    "She\nwas pleased with the effect it made upon him.",
    "\u2018With money\u2019 she said \u2018if one knows if one has the ability if one has\nthe discrimination what is there that money cannot do It can give one\nthe best.\u2019\nShe said the last two words with a rich enjoyment a kind of smacking\nof the lips which he found both unpleasant and at the same time slightly\nsinister.",
    "\u2018I see that here\u2019 he said as he looked round the walls.",
    "\u2018You are fond of art Yes I see you are.",
    "There on the east wall is the\nfinest C\u00e9zanne in the world today.",
    "Some say that the\u2013ah I forget the\nname of it at the moment the one in the Metropolitan in New York\u2013is\nfiner.",

    "\u2018Quite wonderful.\u2019\nDrinks were being handed round.",
    "The Old Woman of the Mountain\nSir Stafford Nye noticed did not drink anything.",
    "It was possible he\nthought that she feared to take any risks over her blood pressure with\nthat vast weight.",
    "\u2018And where did you meet this child\u2019 asked the mountainous Dragon.",
    "Was it a trap He did not know but he made his decision.",
    "\u2018At the American Embassy in London.\u2019\n\u2018Ah yes so I heard.",

    "She chuckled.",
    "\u2018Aha you\u2019re tactful are you not Ah well he does well enough.",
    "He\ndoes what he is told as a good politician should.",
    "And it is enjoyable to be\nAmbassador in London.",
    "She could do that for him Milly Jean.",
    "Ah she\ncould get him an Embassy anywhere in the world with that wellstuffed\npurse of hers.",
    "Her father owns half the oil in Texas he owns land\ngoldfields everything.",
    "A coarse singularly ugly man\u2013But what does she\nlook like A gentle little aristocrat.",
    "Not blatant not rich.",

    "\u2018And you You are not rich\u2019\n\u2018I wish I was.\u2019\n\u2018The Foreign Office nowadays it is not shall we say very\nrewarding\u2019\n\u2018Oh well I would not put it like that\u2026After all one goes places one\nmeets amusing people one sees the world one sees something of what\ngoes on.\u2019\n\u2018Something yes.",
    "But not everything.\u2019\n\u2018That would be very difficult.\u2019\n\u2018Have you ever wished to see what\u2013how shall I put it\u2013what goes on\nbehind the scenes in life\u2019\n\u2018One has an idea sometimes.\u2019 He made his voice noncommittal.",
    "\u2018I have heard it said that that is true of you that you have sometimes\nideas about things.",
    "Not perhaps the conventional ideas\u2019\n\u2018There have been times when I\u2019ve been made to feel the bad boy of\nthe family\u2019 said Stafford Nye and laughed.",
    "Old Charlotte chuckled.",
    "\u2018You don\u2019t mind admitting things now and again do you\u2019\n\u2018Why pretend People always know what you\u2019re concealing.\u2019\nShe looked at him.",
    "\u2018What do you want out of life young man\u2019\nHe shrugged his shoulders.",
    "Here again he had to play things by ear.",
    "\u2018Nothing\u2019 he said.",

    "I am not ambitious.",
    "Do I look ambitious\u2019\n\u2018No I will admit that.\u2019\n\u2018I ask only to be amused to live comfortably to eat to drink in\nmoderation to have friends who amuse me.\u2019\nThe old woman leant forward.",
    "Her eyes snapped open and shut three\nor four times.",
    "Then she spoke in a rather different voice.",
    "It was like a\nwhistling note.",
    "\u2018Can you hate Are you capable of hating\u2019\n\u2018To hate is a waste of time.\u2019\n\u2018I see.",
    "I see.",
    "There are no lines of discontent in your face.",
    "That is true\nenough.",
    "All the same I think you are ready to take a certain path which\nwill lead you to a certain place and you will go along it smiling as\nthough you did not care but all the same in the end if you find the right\nadvisers the right helpers you might attain what you want if you are\ncapable of wanting.\u2019\n\n\f\u2018As to that\u2019 said Stafford Nye \u2018who isn\u2019t\u2019 He shook his head at her\nvery gently.",
    "\u2018You see too much\u2019 he said.",
    "\u2018Much too much.\u2019\nFootmen threw open a door.",
    "\u2018Dinner is served.\u2019\nThe proceedings were properly formal.",
    "They had indeed almost a\nroyal tinge about them.",
    "The big doors at the far end of the room were\nflung open showing through to a brightly lighted ceremonial diningroom with a painted ceiling and three enormous chandeliers.",
    "Two\nmiddleaged women approached the Gr\u00e4fin one on either side.",
    "They\nwore evening dress their grey hair was carefully piled on their heads\neach wore a diamond brooch.",
    "To Sir Stafford Nye all the same they\nbrought a faint flavour of wardresses.",
    "They were he thought not so\nmuch security guards as perhaps highclass nursing attendants in charge\nof the health the toilet and other intimate details of the Gr\u00e4fin\nCharlotte\u2019s existence.",
    "After respectful bows each one of them slipped an\narm below the shoulder and elbow of the sitting woman.",
    "With the ease of\nlong practice aided by the effort which was obviously as much as she\ncould make they raised her to her feet in a dignified fashion.",
    "\u2018We will go in to dinner now\u2019 said Charlotte.",
    "With her two female attendants she led the way.",
    "On her feet she\nlooked even more a mass of wobbling jelly yet she was still formidable.",
    "You could not dispose of her in your mind as just a fat old woman.",
    "She\nwas somebody knew she was somebody intended to be somebody.",
    "Behind the three of them he and Renata followed.",
    "As they entered through the portals of the diningroom he felt it was\nalmost more a banquet hall than a diningroom.",
    "There was a bodyguard\nhere.",
    "Tall fairhaired handsome young men.",
    "They wore some kind of\nuniform.",
    "As Charlotte entered there was a clash as one and all drew their\nswords.",
    "They cross them overhead to make a passageway and Charlotte\nsteadying herself passed along that passageway released by her\nattendants and making her progress solo to a vast carved chair with gold\nfittings and upholstered in golden brocade at the head of the long table.",
    "It\nwas rather like a wedding procession Stafford Nye thought.",
    "A naval or\nmilitary one.",
    "In this case surely military strictly military\u2013but lacking a\nbridegroom.",
    "They were all young men of super physique.",
    "None of them he\nthought was older than thirty.",
    "They had good looks their health was\nevident.",
    "They did not smile they were entirely serious they were\u2013he\nthought of a word for it\u2013yes dedicated.",
    "Perhaps not so much a military\nprocession as a religious one.",
    "The servitors appeared oldfashioned\n\n\fservitors belonging he thought to the Schloss\u2019s past to a time before the\n1939 war.",
    "It was like a super production of a period historic play.",
    "And\nqueening over it sitting in the chair or the throne or whatever you liked\nto call it at the head of the table was not a queen or an empress but an\nold woman noticeable mainly for her avoirdupois weight and her\nextraordinary and intense ugliness.",
    "Who was she What was she doing\nhere Why\nWhy all this masquerade why this bodyguard a security bodyguard\nperhaps Other diners came to the table.",
    "They bowed to the monstrosity\non the presiding throne and took their places.",
    "They wore ordinary\nevening dress.",
    "No introductions were made.",

    "Different types.",
    "A great many different types.",
    "Lawyers he was certain.",
    "Several lawyers.",
    "Possibly accountants or financiers one or two army\nofficers in plain clothes.",
    "They were of the Household he thought but\nthey were also in the oldfashioned feudal sense of the term those who\n\u2018sat below the salt\u2019.",
    "Food came.",
    "A vast boar\u2019s head pickled in aspic venison a cool\nrefreshing lemon sorbet a magnificent edifice of pastry\u2013a super\nmillefeuille that seemed of unbelievable confectionary richness.",
    "The vast woman ate ate greedily hungrily enjoying her food.",
    "From\noutside came a new sound.",
    "The sound of the powerful engine of a super\nsports car.",
    "It passed the windows in a white flash.",
    "There came a cry\ninside the room from the bodyguard.",
    "A great cry of \u2018Heil Heil Heil\nFranz\u2019\nThe bodyguard of young men moved with the ease of a military\nmanoeuvre known by heart.",
    "Everyone had risen to their feet.",
    "Only the\nold woman sat without moving her head lifted high on her dais.",
    "And so\nStafford Nye thought a new excitement now permeated the room.",
    "The other guests or the other members of the household whatever\nthey were disappeared in a way that somehow reminded Stafford of\nlizards disappearing into the cracks of a wall.",
    "The goldenhaired boys\nformed a new figure their swords flew out they saluted their patroness\nshe bowed her head in acknowledgment their swords were sheathed and\nthey turned permission given to march out through the door of the\nroom.",
    "Her eyes followed them then went first to Renata and then to\nStafford Nye.",
    "\u2018What do you think of them\u2019 she said.",
    "\u2018My boys my youth corps my\nchildren.",
    "Yes my children.",
    "Have you a word that can describe them\u2019\n\n\f\u2018I think so\u2019 said Stafford Nye.",
    "\u2018Magnificent.\u2019 He spoke to her as to\nRoyalty.",
    "\u2018Magnificent ma\u2019am.\u2019\n\u2018Ah\u2019 She bowed her head.",
    "She smiled the wrinkles multiplying all\nover her face.",
    "It made her look exactly like a crocodile.",
    "A terrible woman he thought a terrible woman impossible dramatic.",
    "Was any of this happening He couldn\u2019t believe it was.",
    "What could this\nbe but yet another festival hall in which a production was being given.",
    "The doors clashed open again.",
    "The yellowhaired band of the young\nsupermen marched as before through it.",
    "This time they did not wield\nswords instead they sang.",
    "Sang with unusual beauty of tone and voice.",
    "After a good many years of pop music Stafford Nye felt an\nincredulous pleasure.",
    "Trained voices these.",
    "Not raucous shouting.",
    "Trained by masters of the singing art.",
    "Not allowed to strain their vocal\ncords to be off key.",
    "They might be the new Heroes of a New World but\nwhat they sang was not new music.",
    "It was music he had heard before.",
    "An\narrangement of the Preislied there must be a concealed orchestra\nsomewhere he thought in a gallery round the top of the room.",
    "It was an\narrangement or adaptation of various Wagnerian themes.",
    "It passed from\nthe Preislied to the distant echoes of the Rhine music.",
    "The Elite Corps made once more a double lane where somebody was\nexpected to make an entrance.",
    "It was not the old Empress this time.",
    "She\nsat on her dais awaiting whoever was coming.",
    "And at last he came.",
    "The music changed as he came.",
    "It gave out that\nmotif which by now Stafford Nye had got by heart.",
    "The melody of the\nYoung Siegfried.",
    "Siegfried\u2019s horn call rising up in its youth and its\ntriumph its mastery of a new world which the young Siegfried came to\nconquer.",
    "Through the doorway marching up between the lines of what were\nclearly his followers came one of the handsomest young men Stafford\nNye had ever seen.",
    "Goldenhaired blueeyed perfectly proportioned\nconjured up as it were by the wave of a magician\u2019s wand he came forth\nout of the world of myth.",
    "Myth heroes resurrection rebirth it was all\nthere.",
    "His beauty his strength his incredible assurance and arrogance.",
    "He strode through the double lines of his bodyguard until he stood\nbefore the hideous mountain of womanhood that sat there on her throne\nhe knelt on one knee raised her hand to his lips and then rising to his\nfeet he threw up one arm in salutation and uttered the cry that Stafford\nNye had heard from the others.",
    "\u2018Heil\u2019 His German was not very clear\nbut Stafford Nye thought he distinguished the syllables \u2018Heil to the great\nmother\u2019\n\n\fThen the handsome young hero looked from one side to the other.",
    "There was some faint recognition though an uninterested one of Renata\nbut when his gaze turned to Stafford Nye there was definite interest and\nappraisal.",

    "\u2018So\u2019 he said \u2018we have guests\u2019 And he added smiling with the\narrogance of a young man who knows that he is vastly superior to any\nother person in the world.",
    "\u2018Welcome guests welcome to you both.\u2019\nSomewhere in the depths of the Schloss a great bell began tolling.",
    "It\nhad no funereal sound about it but it had a disciplinary air.",

    "He said that Martin B.\nhad told him that I actually had a large number of patients thinking not\nto put too fine a point on it that they were themselves Adolf Hitler.",

    "If any of these socalled Hitlers believing passionately in\nthemselves as such were inclined to be a little violent or dangerous\u2026I\nassured him that he need have no worry.",

    "But he was\nexcited with an idea and he said I\u2019d put it into his head so it must have\nbeen something rather pleasant I\u2019d put into his head mustn\u2019t it I mean I\nhadn\u2019t suggested any ideas to him of any nastier ways for killing people\nand I didn\u2019t want people even \u2013you know\u2013to cry like tear gas or\nanything like that.",

    "\u201cNo\u201d he\nsaid \u201cit\u2019s not like that.\u201d He said it\u2019s a\u2013oh of course now I remember.",

    "They preach that to you and\nif you did what they preach it\u2019d be a very happy world.",

    "He proposed to do something in his laboratory\nto bring about this result by purely physical means.\u2019\n\u2018That\u2019s the sort of thing.",
    "And he said you can never tell when things\nare beneficial to people or when they\u2019re not.",
    "They are in one way\nthey\u2019re not in another.",
    "And he said things about\u2013oh penicillin and\nsulphonamides and heart transplants and things like pills for women\nthough we hadn\u2019t got \u201cThe Pill\u201d then.",
    "But you know things that seem all\nright and they\u2019re wonderdrugs or wondergases or wondersomething or\nother and then there\u2019s something about them that makes them go wrong\nas well as right and then you wish they weren\u2019t there and had never been\nthought of.",
    "Well that\u2019s the sort of thing that he seemed to be trying to get\nover to me.",
    "It was all rather difficult to understand.",
    "I said \u201cDo you mean\nyou don\u2019t like to take the risk\u201d and he said \u201cYou\u2019re quite right.",
    "I don\u2019t\nlike to take the risk.",
    "That\u2019s the trouble because you see I don\u2019t know in\nthe least what the risk will be.",
    "That\u2019s what happens to us poor devils of\nscientists.",
    "We take the risks and the risks are not in what we\u2019ve\ndiscovered it\u2019s the risks of what the people we\u2019ll have to tell about it\nwill do with what we\u2019ve discovered.\u201d I said \u201cNow you\u2019re talking about\nnuclear weapons again and atom bombs\u201d and he said \u201cOh to Hell with\nnuclear weapons and atomic bombs.",
    "We\u2019ve gone far beyond that.\u201d\n\u2018\u201cBut if you\u2019re going to make people nicetempered and benevolent\u201d\nI said \u201cwhat have you got to worry about\u201d And he said \u201cYou don\u2019t\nunderstand Matilda.",
    "You\u2019ll never understand.",
    "My fellow scientists in all\nprobability would not understand either.",
    "And no politicians would ever\nunderstand.",
    "And so you see it\u2019s too big a risk to be taken.",
    "At any rate\none would have to think for a long time.\u201d\n\u2018\u201cBut\u201d I said \u201cyou could bring people out of it again just like\nlaughing gas couldn\u2019t you I mean you could make people benevolent\njust for a short time and then they\u2019d get all right again\u2013or all wrong\nagain\u2013it depends which way you look at it I should have thought.\u201d And\nhe said \u201cNo.",
    "This will be you see permanent.",
    "Quite permanent because\nit affects the\u2013\u201d and then he went into jargon again.",
    "You know long\n\n\fwords and numbers.",
    "Formulas or molecular changes\u2013something like\nthat.",

    "I forget which it is.",
    "Something like that.",

    "Air or train.",

    "That was Security\u2019s\ndoing he supposed.",
    "Taking no chances.",
    "He\u2019d done this sort of thing\nbefore more than once.",

    "A faithful dog who never left his side.",
    "He would have with him\nrestoratives stimulants all the medical box of tricks.",
    "The Squadron\nLeader wondered why there wasn\u2019t a doctor also in attendance.",
    "It would\nhave been an extra precaution.",
    "Like a death\u2019s head the old man looked.",
    "A noble death\u2019s head.",
    "Something made of marble in a museum.",
    "Henry\nHorsham the Squadron Leader knew quite well.",
    "He knew several of the\nSecurity lot.",
    "And Colonel Munro looking slightly less fierce than usual\nrather more worried.",
    "Not very happy on the whole.",
    "There was also a\nlarge yellowfaced man.",
    "Foreigner he might be.",
    "Asiatic What was he\ndoing flying in a plane to the North of Scotland The Squadron Leader\nsaid deferentially to Colonel Munro\n\u2018Everything laid on sir The car is here waiting.\u2019\n\u2018How far exactly is the distance\u2019\n\u2018Seventeen miles sir roughish road but not too bad.",
    "There are extra\nrugs in the car.\u2019\n\u2018You have your orders Repeat please if you will Squadron Leader\nAndrews.\u2019\nThe Squadron Leader repeated and the Colonel nodded satisfaction.",
    "As the car finally drove off the Squadron Leader looked after it\nwondering to himself why on earth those particular people were here on\n\n\fthis drive over the lonely moor to a venerable old castle where a sick\nman lived as a recluse without friends or visitors in the general run of\nthings.",
    "Horsham knew he supposed.",
    "Horsham must know a lot of\nstrange things.",
    "Oh well Horsham wasn\u2019t likely to tell him anything.",
    "The car was well and carefully driven.",
    "It drew up at last over a gravel\ndriveway and came to a stop before the porch.",

    "I thought you would\nprefer privacy but that she ought not to be out of call in case she was\nneeded.\u2019\n\u2018Is he in very bad health\u2019 asked Colonel Munro.",
    "\u2018He doesn\u2019t actually suffer\u2019 said Miss Neumann \u2018but you must\nprepare yourself if you have not seen him that is for a long time.",
    "He is\nonly what is left of a man.\u2019\n\u2018Just one moment before you take us to him.",
    "His mental processes are\nnot too badly depleted He can understand what one says to him\u2019\n\u2018Oh yes he can understand perfectly but as he is semiparalysed he\nis unable to speak with much clarity though that varies and is unable to\nwalk without help.",
    "His brain in my opinion is as good as ever it was.",
    "The only difference is that he tires very easily now.",
    "Now would you like\nsome refreshment first\u2019\n\u2018No\u2019 said Lord Altamount.",
    "\u2018No I don\u2019t want to wait.",
    "This is a rather\nurgent matter on which we have come so if you will take us to him\nnow\u2013he expects us I understand\u2019\n\u2018He expects you yes\u2019 said Lisa Neumann.",
    "She led the way up some stairs along a corridor and opened a room of\nmedium size.",
    "It had tapestries on the wall the heads of stags looked\ndown on them the place had been a onetime shootingbox.",
    "It had been\nlittle changed in its furnishing or arrangements.",
    "There was a big recordplayer on one side of the room.",

    "A man who had once been tall sturdy strong.",
    "He had a fine\nforehead deepset eyes and a rugged determinedlooking chin.",
    "The\neyes below the heavy eyebrows were intelligent.",
    "He said something.",
    "His voice was not weak it made fairly clear sounds but not always\nrecognizable ones.",
    "The faculty of speech had only partly gone from him\nhe was still understandable.",

    "\u2018Some questions I can ask of Miss Neumann.\u2019\nShoreham\u2019s hand went out in a faint gesture towards the woman\nstanding by his side.",
    "Sounds came from his lips again not quite\nrecognizable to them but she translated quickly.",
    "\u2018He says he can depend on me to transcribe anything you wish to say\nto him or I to you.\u2019\n\u2018You have I think already received a letter from me\u2019 said Colonel\nMunro.",
    "\u2018That is so\u2019 said Miss Neumann.",
    "\u2018Professor Shoreham received your\nletter and knows its contents.\u2019\nA hospital nurse opened the door just a crack\u2013but she did not come in.",

    "I should be\nglad though if you could stay in your sittingroom just along the\npassage in case we should need anything.\u2019\n\u2018Certainly\u2013I quite understand.\u2019 She went away closing the door softly.",
    "\u2018We don\u2019t want to lose time\u2019 said Colonel Munro.",
    "\u2018No doubt\nProfessor Shoreham is in tune with current affairs.\u2019\n\u2018Entirely so\u2019 said Miss Neumann \u2018as far as he is interested.\u2019\n\u2018Does he keep in touch with scientific advancements and such things\u2019\nRobert Shoreham\u2019s head shook slightly from side to side.",
    "He himself\nanswered.",
    "\u2018I have finished with all that.\u2019\n\u2018But you know roughly the state the world is in The success of what\nis called the Revolution of Youth.",
    "The seizing of power by youthful\nfullyequipped forces.\u2019\nMiss Neumann said \u2018He is in touch entirely with everything that is\ngoing on\u2013in a political sense that is.\u2019\n\u2018The world is now given over to violence pain revolutionary tenets a\nstrange and incredible philosophy of rule by an anarchic minority.\u2019\nA faint look of impatience went across the gaunt face.",
    "\u2018He knows all that\u2019 said Mr Robinson speaking unexpectedly.",
    "\u2018No\nneed to go over a lot of things again.",
    "He\u2019s a man who knows everything.\u2019\n\n\fHe said\n\u2018Do you remember Admiral Blunt\u2019\nAgain the head bowed.",
    "Something like a smile showed on the twisted\nlips.",
    "\u2018Admiral Blunt remembers some scientific work you had done on a\ncertain project\u2013I think project is what you call these things Project\nBenvo.\u2019\nThey saw the alert look which came into the eyes.",
    "\u2018Project Benvo\u2019 said Miss Neumann.",
    "\u2018You are going back quite a long\ntime Mr Robinson to recall that.\u2019\n\u2018It was your project wasn\u2019t it\u2019 said Mr Robinson.",
    "\u2018Yes it was his project.\u2019 Miss Neumann now spoke more easily for\nhim as a matter of course.",
    "\u2018We cannot use nuclear weapons we cannot use explosives or gas or\nchemistry but your project Project Benvo we could use.\u2019\nThere was silence and nobody spoke.",
    "And then again the queer\ndistorted sounds came from Professor Shoreham\u2019s lips.",
    "\u2018He says of course\u2019 said Miss Neumann \u2018Benvo could be used\nsuccessfully in the circumstances in which we find ourselves\u2013\u2019\nThe man in the chair had turned to her and was saying something to\nher.",
    "\u2018He wants me to explain it to you\u2019 said Miss Neumann.",
    "\u2018Project B\nlater called Project Benvo was something that he worked upon for many\nyears but which at last he laid aside for reasons of his own.\u2019\n\u2018Because he had failed to make his project materialize\u2019\n\u2018No he had not failed\u2019 said Lisa Neumann.",
    "\u2018We had not failed.",
    "I\nworked with him on this project.",
    "He laid it aside for certain reasons but\nhe did not fail.",
    "He succeeded.",
    "He was on the right track he developed it\nhe tested it in various laboratory experiments and it worked.\u2019 She turned\nto Professor Shoreham again made a few gestures with her hand\ntouching her lips ear mouth in a strange kind of code signal.",
    "\u2018I am asking if he wants me to explain just what Benvo does.\u2019\n\u2018We do want you to explain.\u2019\n\u2018And he wants to know how you learnt about it.\u2019\n\u2018We learnt about it\u2019 said Colonel Munro \u2018through an old friend of\nyours Professor Shoreham.",
    "Not Admiral Blunt he could not remember\nvery much but the other person to whom you had once spoken about it\nLady Matilda Cleckheaton.\u2019\nAgain Miss Neumann turned to him and watched his lips.",
    "She smiled\nfaintly.",
    "\u2018He says he thought Matilda was dead years ago.\u2019\n\u2018She is very much alive.",
    "It is she who wanted us to know about this\ndiscovery of Professor Shoreham\u2019s.\u2019\n\u2018Professor Shoreham will tell you the main points of what you want to\nknow though he has to warn you that this knowledge will be quite\nuseless to you.",
    "Papers formulae accounts and proofs of this discovery\nwere all destroyed.",
    "But since the only way to satisfy your questions is for\nyou to learn the main outline of Project Benvo I can tell you fairly\nclearly of what it consists.",
    "You know the uses and purpose of tear gas as\nused by the police in controlling riot crowds violent demonstrations and\nso on.",
    "It induces a fit of weeping painful tears and sinus inflammation.\u2019\n\u2018And this is something of the same kind\u2019\n\u2018No it is not in the least of the same kind but it can have the same\npurpose.",
    "It came into the heads of scientists that one can change not only\nmen\u2019s principal reactions and feeling but also mental characteristics.",
    "You can change a man\u2019s character.",
    "The qualities of an aphrodisiac are\nwell known.",
    "They lead to a condition of sexual desire there are various\ndrugs or gases or glandular operations\u2013any of these things can lead to a\nchange in your mental vigour increased energy as by alterations to the\nthyroid gland and Professor Shoreham wishes to tell you that there is a\ncertain process\u2013he will not tell you now whether it is glandular or a gas\nthat can be manufactured but there is something that can change a man\nin his outlook on life\u2013his reaction to people and to life generally.",
    "He may\nbe in a state of homicidal fury he may be pathologically violent and yet\nby the influence of Project Benvo he turns into something or rather\nsomeone quite different.",
    "He becomes\u2013there is only one word for it I\nbelieve which is embodied in its name\u2013he becomes benevolent.",
    "He\nwishes to benefit others.",
    "He exudes kindness.",
    "He has a horror of causing\npain or inflicting violence.",
    "Benvo can be released over a big area it can\naffect hundreds thousands of people if manufactured in big enough\nquantities and if distributed successfully.\u2019\n\u2018How long does it last\u2019 said Colonel Munro.",
    "\u2018Twentyfour hours\nLonger\u2019\n\u2018You don\u2019t understand\u2019 said Miss Neumann.",
    "\u2018It is permanent.\u2019\n\u2018Permanent You\u2019ve changed a man\u2019s nature you\u2019ve altered a\ncomponent a physical component of course of his being which has\nproduced the effect of a permanent change in his nature.",
    "And you cannot\ngo back on that You cannot put him back to where he was again.",
    "It has\nto be accepted as a permanent change\u2019\n\n\f\u2018Yes.",
    "It was perhaps a discovery more of medical interest at first but\nProfessor Shoreham had conceived of it as a deterrent to be used in war\nin mass risings riotings revolutions anarchy.",
    "He didn\u2019t think of it as\nmerely medical.",
    "It does not produce happiness in the subject only a great\nwish for others to be happy.",
    "That is an effect he says that everyone feels\nin their life at one time or another.",
    "They have a great wish to make\nsomeone one person or many people\u2013to make them comfortable happy\nin good health all these things.",
    "And since people can and do feel these\nthings there is we both believed a component that controls that desire\nin their bodies and if you once put that component in operation it can go\non in perpetuity.\u2019\n\u2018Wonderful\u2019 said Mr Robinson.",
    "He spoke thoughtfully rather than enthusiastically.",
    "\u2018Wonderful.",
    "What a thing to have discovered.",
    "What a thing to be able\nto put into action if\u2013but why\u2019\nThe head resting towards the back of the chair turned slowly towards\nMr Robinson.",
    "Miss Neumann said\n\u2018He says you understand better than the others.\u2019\n\u2018But it\u2019s the answer\u2019 said James Kleek.",
    "\u2018It\u2019s the exact answer It\u2019s\nwonderful.\u2019 His face was enthusiastically excited.",
    "Miss Neumann was shaking her head.",
    "\u2018Project Benvo\u2019 she said \u2018is not for sale and not for a gift.",
    "It has been\nrelinquished.\u2019\n\u2018Are you telling us the answer is no\u2019 said Colonel Munro\nincredulously.",
    "\u2018Yes.",
    "Professor Shoreham says the answer is no.",
    "He decided that it\nwas against\u2013\u2019 she paused a minute and turned to look at the man in the\nchair.",
    "He made quaint gestures with his head with one hand and a few\nguttural sounds came from his mouth.",
    "She waited and then she said \u2018He\nwill tell you himself he was afraid.",
    "Afraid of what science has done in\nits time of triumph.",
    "The things it has found out and known the things it\nhas discovered and given to the world.",
    "The wonder drugs that have not\nalways been wonder drugs the penicillin that has saved lives and the\npenicillin that has taken lives the heart transplants that have brought\ndisillusion and the disappointment of a death not expected.",
    "He has lived\nin the period of nuclear fission new weapons that have slain.",
    "The\ntragedies of radioactivity the pollutions that new industrial discoveries\nhave brought about.",
    "He has been afraid of what science could do used\nindiscriminately.\u2019\n\u2018But this is a benefit.",
    "A benefit to everyone\u2019 cried Munro.",
    "\u2018So have many things been.",
    "Always greeted as great benefits to\nhumanity as great wonders.",
    "And then come the side effects and worse\nthan that the fact that they have sometimes brought not benefit but\ndisaster.",
    "And so he decided that he would give up.",
    "He says\u2019\u2013she read\nfrom a paper she held whilst beside her he nodded agreement from his\nchair\u2013\n\u2018\u201cI am satisfied that I have done what I set out to do that I made\nmy discovery.",
    "But I decided not to put it into circulation.",
    "It must\nbe destroyed.",
    "And so it has been destroyed.",
    "And so the answer to\nyou is no.",
    "There is no benevolence on tap.",
    "There could have been\nonce but now all the formulae all the knowhow my notes and\nmy account of the necessary procedure are gone\u2013burnt to ashes\u2013I\nhave destroyed my brain child.\u201d\u2019\nII\nRobert Shoreham struggled into raucous difficult speech.",
