    "\fHALLOWEEN PARTY 1969\nAgatha Christie\nTo P.G.",
    "Wodehouse\nwhose books and stories have brightened my life for many years.",
    "Also to show my pleasure in his having been kind\nenough to tell me that he enjoys my books.",
    "Chapter 1\nMrs Ariadne Oliver had gone with the friend with whom she was staying Judith Butler to help with the\npreparations for a childrens party which was to take place that same evening.",
    "At the moment it was a scene of chaotic activity.",
    "Energetic women came in and out of doors moving chairs small\ntables flower vases and carrying large quantities of yellow pumpkins which they disposed strategically in selected\nspots.",
    "It was to be a Halloween party for invited guests of an age group between ten and seventeen years old.",
    "Mrs Oliver removing herself from the main group leant against a vacant background of wall and held up a large\nyellow pumpkin looking at it critically.",
    "The last time I saw one of these she said sweeping back her grey hair from her prominent forehead was in the\nUnited States last year  hundreds of them.",
    "All over the house.",
    "Ive never seen so many pumpkins.",
    "As a matter of\nfact she added thoughtfully Ive never really known the difference between a pumpkin and a vegetable marrow.",
    "Whats this one\nSorry dear said Mrs Butler as she fell over her friends feet.",
    "Mrs Oliver pressed herself closer against the wall.",
    "My fault she said.",
    "Im standing about and getting in the way.",
    "But it was rather remarkable seeing so many\npumpkins or vegetable marrows whatever they are.",
    "They were everywhere in the shops and in peoples houses\nwith candles or night lights inside them or strung up.",
    "Very interesting really.",
    "But it wasnt for a Halloween party it\nwas Thanksgiving.",
    "Now Ive always associated pumpkins with Halloween and thats the end of October.",
    "Thanksgiving comes much later doesnt it Isnt it November about the third week in November Anyway here\nHalloween is definitely the 31st of October isnt it First Halloween and then what comes next All Souls Day\nThats when in Paris you go to cemeteries and put flowers on graves.",
    "Not a sad sort of feast.",
    "I mean all the children\ngo too and enjoy themselves.",
    "You go to flower markets first and buy lots and lots of lovely flowers.",
    "Flowers never\nlook so lovely as they do in Paris in the market there.",
    "A lot of busy women were falling over Mrs Oliver occasionally but they were not listening to her.",
    "They were all too\nbusy with what they were doing.",
    "They consisted for the most part of mothers one or two competent spinsters there\nwere useful teenagers boys of sixteen and seventeen climbing up ladders or standing on chairs to put decorations\npumpkins or vegetable marrows or brightly coloured witch balls at a suitable elevation girls from eleven to fifteen\nhung about in groups and giggled.",
    "And after All Souls Day and cemeteries went on Mrs Oliver lowering her bulk on to the arm of a settee you\nhave All Saints Day.",
    "I think Im right Nobody responded to this question.",
    "Mrs Drake a handsome middleaged woman who was giving the party made a pronouncement.",
    "Im not calling this a Halloween party although of course it is one really.",
    "Im calling it the Eleven Plus party.",
    "Its\nthat sort of age group.",
    "Mostly people who are leaving The Elms and going on to other schools.",
    "But thats not very accurate Rowena is it said Miss Whittaker resetting her pincenez on her nose\ndisapprovingly.",
    "Miss Whittaker as a local schoolteacher was always firm on accuracy.",
    "Because weve abolished the eleven plus some time ago.",
    "Mrs Oliver rose from the settee apologetically.",
    "I havent been making myself useful.",
    "Ive just been sitting here saying silly things about pumpkins and vegetable\nmarrows  And resting my feet she thought with a slight pang of conscience but without sufficient feeling of guilt\nto say it aloud.",
    "Now what can I do next she asked and added What lovely apples Someone had just brought a large bowl of\napples into the room.",
    "Mrs Oliver was partial to apples.",
    "Lovely red ones she added.",
    "Theyre not really very good said Rowena Drake.",
    "But they look nice and partified.",
    "Thats for bobbing for apples.",
    "Theyre rather soft apples so people will be able to get their teeth into them better.",
    "Take them into the library will\nyou Beatrice Bobbing for apples always makes a mess with the water slopping over but that doesnt matter with\nthe library carpet its so old.",
    "Oh\nthank you Joyce.",
    "Joyce a sturdy thirteenyearold seized the bowl of apples.",
    "Two rolled off it and stopped as though arrested by a\nwitchs wand at Mrs Olivers feet.",
    "You like apples dont you said Joyce.",
    "I read you did or perhaps I heard it on the telly.",
    "Youre the one who\nwrites murder stories arent you\nYes said Mrs Oliver.",
    "We ought to have made you do something connected with murders.",
    "Have a murder at the party tonight and make\npeople solve it.",
    "No thank you said Mrs Oliver.",
    "Never again.",
    "What do you mean never again\nWell I did once and it didnt turn out much of a success said Mrs Oliver.",
    "But youve written lots of books said Joyce you make a lot of money out of them dont you\nIn a way said Mrs Oliver her thoughts flying to the Inland Revenue.",
    "And youve got a detective whos a Finn.",
    "Mrs Oliver admitted the fact.",
    "A small stolid boy not yet Mrs Oliver would have thought arrived at the seniority of\nthe elevenplus said sternly Why a Finn\nIve often wondered said Mrs Oliver truthfully.",
    "Mrs Hargreaves the organists wife came into the room breathing\nheavily and bearing a large green plastic pail.",
    "What about this she said for the apple bobbing Kind of gay I thought.",
    "Miss Lee the doctors dispenser said\nGalvanised buckets better.",
    "Wont tip over so easily.",
    "Where are you going to have it Mrs Drake\nI thought the bobbing for apples had better be in the library.",
    "The carpets old there and a lot of water always gets\nspilt anyway.",
    "All right.",
    "Well take em along.",
    "Rowena heres another basket of apples.",
    "Let me help said Mrs Oliver.",
    "She picked up the two apples at her feet.",
    "Almost without noticing what she was doing she sank her teeth into one of them and began to crunch it.",
    "Mrs Drake\nabstracted the second apple from her firmly and restored it to the basket.",
    "A buzz of conversation broke out.",
    "Yes but where are we going to have the Snapdragon\nYou ought to have the Snapdragon in the library its much the darkest room.",
    "No were going to have that in the diningroom.",
    "Well have to put something on the table first.",
    "Theres a green baize cloth to put on that and then the rubber sheet over it.",
    "What about the lookingglasses Shall we really see our husbands in them Surreptitiously removing her shoes\nand still quietly chomping at her apple Mrs Oliver lowered herself once more on to the settee and surveyed the\nroom full of people critically.",
    "She was thinking in her authoresss mind Now if I was going to make a book about\nall these people how should I do it Theyre nice people I should think on the whole but who knows\nIn a way she felt it was rather fascinating not to know anything about them.",
    "They all lived in Woodleigh Common\nsome of them had faint tags attached to them in her memory because of what Judith had told her.",
    "Miss Johnson something to do with the church not the vicars sister.",
    "Oh no it was the organists sister of course Rowena Drake\nwho seemed to run things in Woodleigh Common.",
    "The puffing woman who had brought in the pail a particularly\nhideous plastic pail.",
    "But then Mrs Oliver had never been fond of plastic things.",
    "And then the children the teenage\ngirls and boys.",
    "So far they were really only names to Mrs Oliver.",
    "There was a Nan and a Beatrice and a Cathie a Diana and a\nJoyce who was boastful and asked questions.",
    "I dont like Joyce much thought Mrs Oliver.",
    "A girl called Ann who\nlooked tall and superior.",
    "There were two adolescent boys who appeared to have just got used to trying out different\nhair styles with rather unfortunate results.",
    "A smallish boy entered in some condition of shynesss.",
    "Mummy sent these mirrors to see if theyd do he said in a slightly breathless voice.",
    "Mrs Drake took them from\nhim.",
    "Thank you so much Eddy she said.",
    "Theyre just ordinary looking handmirrors said the girl called Ann.",
    "Shall we really see our future husbands\nfaces in them\nSome of you may and some may not said Judith Butler.",
    "Did you ever see your husbands face when you went to a party  I mean this kind of a party\nOf course she didnt said Joyce.",
    "She might have said the superior Beatrice.",
    "ESP they call it.",
    "Extra sensory perception she added in the tone of one pleased with being thoroughly conversant\nwith the terms of the times.",
    "I read one of your books said Ann to Mrs Oliver.",
    "The Dying Goldfish.",
    "It was quite good she said kindly.",
    "I didnt like that one said Joyce.",
    "There wasnt enough blood in it.",
    "I like murders to have lots of blood.",
    "A bit messy said Mrs Oliver dont you think\nBut exciting said Joyce.",
    "Not necessarily said Mrs Oliver.",
    "I saw a murder once said Joyce.",
    "Dont be silly Joyce said Miss Whittaker the schoolteacher.",
    "I did said Joyce.",
    "Did you really asked Cathie gazing at Joyce with wide eyes really and truly see a murder\nOf course she didnt said Mrs Drake.",
    "Dont say silly things Joyce.",
    "I did see a murder said Joyce.",
    "I did.",
    "I did.",
    "I did.",
    "A seventeenyearold boy poised on a ladder looked down\ninterestedly.",
    "What kind of a murder he asked.",
    "I dont believe it said Beatrice.",
    "Of course not said Cathies mother.",
    "Shes just making it up.",
    "Im not.",
    "I saw it.",
    "Why didnt you go to the police about it asked Cathie.",
    "Because I didnt know it was a murder when I saw it.",
    "It wasnt really till a long time afterwards I mean that I began\nto know that it was a murder.",
    "Something that somebody said only about a month or two ago suddenly made me\nthink Of course that was a murder I saw.",
    "You see said Ann shes making it all up.",
    "Its nonsense.",
    "When did it happen asked Beatrice.",
    "Years ago said Joyce.",
    "I was quite young at the time she added.",
    "Who murdered who said Beatrice.",
    "I shant tell any of you said Joyce.",
    "Youre all so horrid about it.",
    "Miss Lee came in with another kind of bucket.",
    "Conversation shifted to a comparison of buckets or plastic pails as most suitable for the sport of bobbing for apples.",
    "The majority of the helpers repaired to the library for an appraisal on the spot.",
    "Some of the younger members it may\nbe said were anxious to demonstrate by a rehearsal the difficulties and their own accomplishment in the sport.",
    "Hair got wet water got spilt towels were sent for to mop it up.",
    "In the end it was decided that a galvanised bucket\nwas preferable to the more meretricious charms of a plastic pail which overturned rather too easily.",
    "Mrs Oliver\nsetting down a bowl of apples which she had carried in to replenish the store required for tomorrow once more\nhelped herself to one.",
    "I read in the paper that you were fond of eating apples the accusing voice of Ann or Susan  she was not quite sure\nwhich  spoke to her.",
    "Its my besetting sin said Mrs Oliver.",
    "It would be more fun if it was melons objected one of the boys.",
    "Theyre so juicy.",
    "Think of the mess it would make he said surveying the carpet with pleasurable anticipation.",
    "Mrs Oliver feeling a little guilty at the public arraignment of greediness left the room in search of a particular\napartment the geography of which is usually fairly easily identified.",
    "She went up the staircase and turning the\ncorner on the half landing cannoned into a pair a girl and a boy clasped in each others arms and leaning against the\ndoor which Mrs Oliver felt fairly certain was the door to the room to which she herself was anxious to gain access.",
    "The couple paid no attention to her.",
    "They sighed and they snuggled.",
    "Mrs Oliver wondered how old they were.",
    "The\n\n\fboy was fifteen perhaps the girl little more than twelve although the development of her chest seemed certainly on\nthe mature side.",
    "Apple Trees was a house of fair size.",
    "It had she thought several agreeable nooks and corners.",
    "How selfish people\nare thought Mrs Oliver.",
    "No consideration for others.",
    "That wellknown tag from the past came into her mind.",
    "It had\nbeen said to her in succession by a nursemaid a nanny a governess her grandmother two great aunts her mother\nand a few others.",
    "Excuse me said Mrs Oliver in a loud clear voice.",
    "The boy and the girl clung closer than ever their lips fastened\non each others.",
    "Excuse me said Mrs Oliver again do you mind letting me pass I want to get in at this door.",
    "Unwillingly the couple fell apart.",
    "They looked at her in an aggrieved fashion.",
    "Mrs Oliver went in banged the door\nand shot the bolt.",
    "It was not a very close fitting door.",
    "The faint sound of words came to her from outside.",
    "Isnt that like people one voice said in a somewhat uncertain tenor.",
    "They might see we didnt want to be\ndisturbed.",
    "People are so selfish piped a girls voice.",
    "They never think of anyone but themselves.",
    "No consideration for others said the boys voice.",
    "Chapter 2\nPreparation for a childrens party usually give far more trouble to the organisers than an entertainment devised for\nthose of adult years.",
    "Food of good quality and suitable alcoholic refreshment  with lemonade on the side that to the\nright people is quite enough to make a party go.",
    "It may cost more but the trouble is infinitely less.",
    "So Ariadne\nOliver and her friend Judith Butler agreed together.",
    "What about teenage parties said Judith.",
    "I dont know much about them said Mrs Oliver.",
    "In one way said Judith I think theyre probably least trouble of all.",
    "I mean they just throw all of us adults out.",
    "And say theyll do it all themselves.",
    "And do they\nWell not in our sense of the word said Judith.",
    "They forget to order some of the things and order a lot of other\nthings that nobody likes.",
    "Having thrown us out then they say there were things we ought to have provided for them\nto find.",
    "They break a lot of glasses and other things and theres always somebody undesirable or who brings an\nundesirable friend.",
    "You know the sort of thing.",
    "Peculiar drugs and what do they call it Flower Pot or Purple Hemp\nor LSD which I always have thought just meant money but apparently it doesnt.",
    "I suppose it costs it suggested Ariadne Oliver.",
    "Its very unpleasant and Hemp has a nasty smell.",
    "It all sounds very depressing said Mrs Oliver.",
    "Anyway this party will go all right.",
    "Trust Rowena Drake for that.",
    "Shes a wonderful organiser.",
    "Youll see.",
    "I dont feel I even want to go to a party sighed Mrs Oliver.",
    "You go up and lie down for an hour or so.",
    "Youll see.",
    "Youll enjoy it when you get there.",
    "I wish Miranda hadnt got\na temperature.",
    "Shes so disappointed at not being able to go poor child.",
    "The party came into being at half past seven.",
    "Ariadne Oliver had to admit that her friend was right.",
    "Arrivals were\npunctual.",
    "Everything went splendidly.",
    "It was well imagined well run and ran like clockwork.",
    "There were red and blue lights on the stairs and yellow pumpkins in profusion.",
    "The girls and boys arrived holding\ndecorated broomsticks for a competition.",
    "After greetings Rowena Drake announced the programme for the evening.",
    "First judging of the broomstick competition she said three prizes first second and third.",
    "Then comes cutting\nthe flour cake.",
    "Thatll be in the small conservatory.",
    "Then bobbing for apples  theres a list pinned upon the wall over\nthere of the partners for that event  then therell be dancing.",
    "Every time the lights go out you change partners.",
    "Then\ngirls to the small study where theyll be given their mirrors.",
    "After that supper Snapdragon and then prizegiving.",
    "Like all parties it went slightly stickily at first.",
    "The brooms were admired they were very small miniature brooms\nand on the whole the decorating of them had not reached a very high standard of merit which makes it easier said\nMrs Drake in an aside to one of her friends.",
    "And its a very useful thing because I mean there are always one or two children one knows only too well wont win\na prize at anything else so one can cheat a little over this.",
    "So unscrupulous Rowena.",
    "Im not really.",
    "I just arrange so that things should be fair and evenly divided.",
    "The whole point is that everyone\nwants to win something.",
    "Whats the Flour Game asked Ariadne Oliver.",
    "Oh yes of course you werent here when we were doing it.",
    "Well you just fill a tumbler with flour press it in well\nthen you turn it out in a tray and place a sixpence on top of it.",
    "Then everyone slices a slice off it very carefully so as\nnot to tumble the sixpence off.",
    "As soon as someone tumbles the sixpence off that person goes out.",
    "Its a sort of\nelimination.",
    "The last one left in gets the sixpence of course.",
    "Now then away we go.",
    "And away they went.",
    "Squeals of excitement were heard coming from the library where bobbing for apples went on\nand competitors returned from there with wet locks and having disposed a good deal of water about their persons.",
    "One of the most popular contests at any rate among the girls was the arrival of the Halloween witch played by Mrs\nGoodbody a local cleaning woman who not only having the necessary hooked nose and chin which almost met\nwas admirably proficient in producing a semicooing voice which had definitely sinister undertones and also\nproduced magical doggerel rhymes.",
    "Now then come along.",
    "Beatrice is it Ah Beatrice.",
    "A very interesting name.",
    "Now you want to know what your\nhusband is going to look like.",
    "Now my dear sit here.",
    "Yes yes under this light here.",
    "Sit here and hold this little\nmirror in your hand and presently when the lights go out youll see him appear.",
    "Youll see him looking over your\nshoulder.",
    "Now hold the mirror steady.",
    "Abracadabra who shall see The face of the man who will marry me.",
    "Beatrice Beatrice you shall find the face of the man who shall please your mind.",
    "A sudden shaft of light shot\nacross the room from a stepladder placed behind a screen.",
    "It hit the right spot in the room which was reflected in\nthe mirror grasped in Beatrices excited hand.",
    "Oh cried Beatrice.",
    "Ive seen him.",
    "Ive seen him I can see him in my mirror\nThe beam was shut off the lights came on and a coloured photograph pasted on a card floated down from the\nceiling.",
    "Beatrice danced about excitedly.",
    "That was him That was him I saw him she cried.",
    "Oh hes got a lovely ginger beard.",
    "She rushed to Mrs Oliver who was the nearest person.",
    "Do look do look.",
    "Dont you think hes rather wonderful Hes like Eddie Presweight the pop singer.",
    "Dont you\n\n\fthink so\nMrs Oliver did think he looked like one of the faces she daily deplored having to see in her morning paper.",
    "The\nbeard she thought had been an afterthought of genius.",
    "Where do all these things come from she asked.",
    "Oh Rowena gets Nicky to make them.",
    "And his friend Desmond helps.",
    "He experiments a good deal with\nphotography.",
    "He and a couple of pals of his made themselves up with a great deal of hair or sideburns or beards\nand things.",
    "And then with the light on him and everything of course it sends the girls wild with delight.",
    "I cant help thinking said Ariadne Oliver that girls are really very silly nowadays.",
    "Dont you think they always were asked Rowena Drake.",
    "Mrs Oliver considered.",
    "I suppose youre right she admitted.",
    "Now then cried Mrs Drake  supper.",
    "Supper went off well.",
    "Rich iced cakes savouries prawns cheese and nut\nconfections.",
    "The elevenpluses stuffed themselves.",
    "And now said Rowena that last one for the evening.",
    "Snapdragon.",
    "Across there through the pantry.",
    "Thats right.",
    "Now then.",
    "Prizes first.",
    "The prizes were presented and then there was a wailing banshee call.",
    "The children rushed\nacross the hall back to the diningroom.",
    "The food had been cleared away.",
    "A green baize cloth was laid across the table and here was borne a great dish of\nflaming raisins.",
    "Everybody shrieked rushing forward snatching the blazing raisins with cries of Ow Im burned\nIsnt it lovely Little by little the Snapdragon flickered and died down.",
    "The lights went up.",
    "The party was over.",
    "Its been a great success said Rowena.",
    "So it should be with all the trouble youve taken.",
    "It was lovely said Judith quietly.",
    "Lovely.",
    "And now she added ruefully well have to clear up a bit.",
    "We cant leave everything for those poor women\ntomorrow morning.",
    "Chapter 3\nIn a flat in London the telephone bell rang.",
    "The owner of the flat Hercule Poirot stirred in his chair.",
    "Disappointment attacked him.",
    "He knew before he answered it what it meant.",
    "His friend Solly with whom he had\nbeen going to spend the evening reviving their never ending controversy about the real culprit in the Canning Road\nMunicipal Baths murder was about to say that he could not come.",
    "Poirot who had collected certain bits of evidence\nin favour of his own somewhat farfetched theory was deeply disappointed.",
    "He did not think his friend Solly would\naccept his suggestions but he had no doubt that when Solly in his turn produced his own fantastic beliefs he\nhimself Hercule Poirot would just as easily be able to demolish them in the name of sanity logic order and\nmethod.",
    "It was annoying to say the least of it if Solly did not come this evening.",
    "But it is true that when they had\nmet earlier in the day Solly had been racked with a chesty cough and was in a state of highly infectious catarrh.",
    "He had a nasty cold said Hercule Poirot and no doubt in spite of the remedies that I have handy here he would\nprobably have given it to me.",
    "It is better that he should not come.",
    "Tout de m\u00eame he added with a sigh it will\nmean that now I shall pass a dull evening.",
    "Many of the evenings were dull now Hercule Poirot thought.",
    "His mind magnificent as it was for he had never\n\n\fdoubted that fact required stimulation from outside sources.",
    "He had never been of a philosophic cast of mind.",
    "There\nwere times when he almost regretted that he had not taken to the study of theology instead of going into the police\nforce in his early days.",
    "The number of angels who could dance on the point of a needle it would be interesting to\nfeel that that mattered and to argue passionately on the point with ones colleagues.",
    "His manservant George entered\nthe room.",
    "It was Mr Solomon Levy sir.",
    "Ah yes said Hercule Poirot.",
    "He very much regrets that he will not be able to join you this evening.",
    "He is in bed with a serious bout of flu.",
    "He has not got flu said Hercule Poirot.",
    "He has only a nasty cold.",
    "Everyone always thinks they have flu.",
    "It\nsounds more important.",
    "One gets more sympathy.",
    "The trouble with a catarrhal cold is that it is hard to glean the\nproper amount of sympathetic consideration from ones friends.",
    "Just as well he isnt coming here sir really said George.",
    "Those colds in the head are very infectious.",
    "Wouldnt be\ngood for you to go down with one of those.",
    "It would be extremely tedious Poirot agreed.",
    "The telephone bell rang again.",
    "And now who has a cold he demanded.",
    "I have not asked anyone else.",
    "George crossed towards the telephone.",
    "I will take the call here said Poirot.",
    "I have no doubt that it is nothing of interest.",
    "But at any rate  he shrugged his shoulders  it will perhaps pass the\ntime.",
    "Who knows George said Very good sir and left the room.",
    "Poirot stretched out a hand raised the receiver\nthus stilling the clamour of the bell.",
    "Hercule Poirot speaks he said with a certain grandeur of manner designed to impress whoever was at the other\nend of the line.",
    "Thats wonderful said an eager voice.",
    "A female voice slightly impaired with breathlessness.",
    "I thought youd be sure to be out that you wouldnt be there.",
    "Why should you think that inquired Poirot.",
    "Because I cant help feeling that nowadays things always happen to frustrate one.",
    "You want someone in a terrible\nhurry you feel you cant wait and you have to wait.",
    "I wanted to get hold of you urgently  absolutely urgently.",
    "And who are you asked Hercule Poirot.",
    "The voice a female one seemed surprised.",
    "Dont you know it said incredulously.",
    "Yes I know said Hercule Poirot.",
    "You are my friend Ariadne.",
    "And Im in a terrible state said Ariadne.",
    "Yes yes I can hear that.",
    "Have you also been running You are very breathless are you not\nI havent been exactly running.",
    "Its emotion.",
    "Can I come and see you at once Poirot let a few moments elapse\nbefore he answered.",
    "His friend Mrs Oliver sounded in a highly excitable condition.",
    "Whatever was the matter with\nher she would no doubt spend a very long time pouring out her grievances her woes her frustrations or whatever\nwas ailing her.",
    "Once having established herself within Poirots sanctum it might be hard to induce her to go home without a certain\namount of impoliteness.",
    "The things that excited Mrs Oliver were so numerous and frequently so unexpected that one\nhad to be careful how one embarked upon a discussion of them.",
    "Something has upset you\nYes.",
    "Of course Im upset.",
    "I dont know what to do.",
    "I dont know  oh I dont know anything.",
    "What I feel is that Ive\ngot to come and tell you  tell you just whats happened for youre the only person who might know what to do.",
    "Who might tell me what I ought to do.",
    "So can I come\nBut certainly but certainly.",
    "I shall be delighted to receive you.",
    "The receiver was thrown down heavily at the other\nend and Poirot summoned George reflected a few minutes then ordered lemon barley water bitter lemon and a\nglass of brandy for himself.",
    "Mrs Oliver will be here in about ten minutes he said.",
    "George withdrew.",
    "He returned with the brandy for Poirot\nwho accepted it with a nod of satisfaction and George then proceeded to provide the teetotal refreshment that was\nthe only thing likely to appeal to Mrs Oliver.",
    "Poirot took a sip of brandy delicately fortifying himself for the ordeal\nwhich was about to descend upon him.",
    "It is a pity he murmured to himself that she is so scatty.",
    "And yet she has originality of mind.",
    "It could be that I\nam going to enjoy what she is coming to tell me.",
    "It could be  he reflected a minute  that it may take a great deal\nof the evening and that it will all be excessively foolish.",
    "Eh bien one must take ones risks in life.",
    "A bell sounded.",
    "A bell on the outside door of the flat this time.",
    "It was not a single pressure of the button.",
    "It lasted for\na long time with a kind of steady action that was very effective the sheer making of noise.",
    "Assuredly she has excited herself said Poirot.",
    "He heard George go to the door open it and before any decorous\nannouncement could be made the door of his sittingroom opened and Ariadne Oliver charged through it with\nGeorge in tow behind her hanging on to something which looked like a fishermans souwester and oilskins.",
    "What on earth are you wearing said Hercule Poirot.",
    "Let George take it from you.",
    "Its very wet.",
    "Of course its wet said Mrs Oliver.",
    "Its very wet out.",
    "I never thought about water before.",
    "Its a terrible thing to\nthink of.",
    "Poirot looked at her with interest.",
    "Will you have some lemon barley water he said or could I persuade you to a small glass of eau de vie\nI hate water said Mrs Oliver.",
    "Poirot looked surprised.",
    "I hate it.",
    "Ive never thought about it before.",
    "What it can do and everything.",
    "My dear friend said Hercule Poirot as George extricated her from the flapping folds of watery oilskin.",
    "Come and sit down here.",
    "Let George finally relieve you of what is it you are wearing\nI got it in Cornwall said Mrs Oliver.",
    "Oilskins.",
    "A real proper fishermans oilskin.",
    "Very useful to him no doubt said Poirot but not I think so suitable for you.",
    "Heavy to wear.",
    "But come sit down\nand tell me.",
    "I dont know how said Mrs Oliver sinking into a chair.",
    "Sometimes you know I cant feel its really true.",
    "But it\nhappened.",
    "It really happened.",
    "Tell me said Poirot.",
    "Thats what Ive come for.",
    "But now Ive got here its so difficult because I dont know where to begin.",
    "At the beginning suggested Poirot or is that too conventional a way of acting\nI dont know when the beginning was.",
    "Not really.",
    "It could have been a long time ago you know.",
    "Calm yourself said Poirot.",
    "Gather together the various threads of this matter in your mind and tell me.",
    "What is it\nthat has so upset you\nIt would have upset you too said Mrs Oliver.",
    "At least I suppose it would.",
    "She looked rather doubtful.",
    "One\ndoesnt know really what does upset you.",
    "You take so many things with a lot of calm.",
    "It is often the best way said Poirot.",
    "All right said Mrs Oliver.",
    "It began with a party.",
    "Ah yes said Poirot relieved to have something as ordinary and sane as a party presented to him.",
    "A party.",
    "You\nwent to a party and something happened.",
    "Do you know what a Halloween party is said Mrs Oliver.",
    "I know what Halloween is said Poirot.",
    "The 31st of October.",
    "He twinkled slightly as he said When witches ride on broomsticks.",
    "There were broomsticks said Mrs Oliver.",
    "They gave prizes for them.",
    "Prizes\nYes for who brought the best decorated ones.",
    "Poirot looked at her rather doubtfully.",
    "Originally relieved at the mention of a party he now again felt slightly\ndoubtful.",
    "Since he knew that Mrs Oliver did not partake of spirituous liquor he could not make one of the\nassumptions that he might have made in any other case.",
    "A childrens party said Mrs Oliver.",
    "Or rather an elevenplus party.",
    "Elevenplus\nWell thats what they used to call it you know in schools.",
    "I mean they see how bright you are and if youre bright\nenough to pass your elevenplus you go on to a grammar school or something.",
    "But if youre not bright enough you\ngo to something called a Secondary Modern.",
    "A silly name.",
    "It doesnt seem to mean anything.",
    "I do not I confess really understand what you are talking about said Poirot.",
    "They seemed to have got away from parties and entered into the realms of education.",
    "Mrs Oliver took a deep breath and began again.",
    "It started really she said with the apples.",
    "Ah yes said Poirot it would.",
    "It always might with you mightnt it He was thinking to himself of a small car on\na hill and a large woman getting out of it and a bag of apples breaking and the apples running and cascading down\nthe hill.",
    "Yes he said encouragingly apples.",
    "Bobbing for apples said Mrs Oliver.",
    "Thats one of the things you do at a Halloween party.",
    "Ah yes I think I have heard of that yes.",
    "You see all sorts of things were being done.",
    "There was bobbing for apples and cutting sixpence off a tumblerful of\nflour and looking in a lookingglass \nTo see your true loves face suggested Poirot knowledgeably.",
    "Ah said Mrs Oliver youre beginning to understand at last.",
    "A lot of old folklore in fact said Poirot and this all took place at your party.",
    "Yes it was all a great success.",
    "It finished up with Snapdragon.",
    "You know burning raisins in a great dish.",
    "I suppose\n her voice faltered I suppose that must be the actual time when it was done.",
    "When what was done\nA murder.",
    "After the Snapdragon everyone went home said Mrs Oliver.",
    "That you see was when they couldnt\nfind her.",
    "Find whom\nA girl.",
    "A girl called Joyce.",
    "Everyone called her name and looked around and asked if shed gone home with anyone\nelse and her mother got rather annoyed and said that Joyce must have felt tired or ill or something and gone off by\nherself and that it was very thoughtless of her not to leave word.",
    "All the sort of things that mothers say when things\nlike that happen.",
    "But anyway we couldnt find Joyce.",
    "And had she gone home by herself\nNo said Mrs Oliver she hadnt gone home...",
    "Her voice faltered.",
    "We found her in the end in the library.",
    "Thats where  where someone did it you know.",
    "Bobbing for apples.",
    "The\nbucket was there.",
    "A big galvanised bucket.",
    "They wouldnt have the plastic one.",
    "Perhaps if theyd had the plastic one\nit wouldnt have happened.",
    "It wouldnt have been heavy enough.",
    "It might have tipped over \nWhat happened said Poirot.",
    "His voice was sharp.",
    "Thats where she was found said Mrs Oliver.",
    "Someone you know someone had shoved her head down into the\nwater with the apples.",
    "Shoved her down and held her there so that she was dead of course.",
    "Drowned.",
    "Drowned.",
    "Just\nin a galvanised iron bucket nearly full of water.",
    "Kneeling there sticking her head down to bob at an apple.",
    "I hate\napples said Mrs Oliver.",
    "I never want to see an apple again...\nPoirot looked at her.",
    "He stretched out a hand and filled a small glass with cognac.",
    "Drink this he said.",
    "It will do you good.",
    "Chapter 4\nMrs Oliver put down the glass and wiped her lips.",
    "You were right she said.",
    "That  that helped.",
    "I was getting hysterical.",
    "You have had a great shock I see now.",
    "When did this happen\nLast night.",
    "Was it only last night Yes yes of course.",
    "And you came to me.",
    "It was not quite a question but it displayed a desire for more information than Poirot had yet had.",
    "You came to me why\nI thought you could help said Mrs Oliver.",
    "You see its  its not simple.",
    "It could be and it could not said Poirot.",
    "A lot depends.",
    "You must tell me more you know.",
    "The police I presume\nare in charge.",
    "A doctor was no doubt called.",
    "What did he say\nTheres to be an inquest said Mrs Oliver.",
    "Naturally.",
    "Tomorrow or the next day.",
    "This girl this Joyce how old was she\nI dont know exactly.",
    "I should think perhaps twelve or thirteen.",
    "Small for her age\nNo no.",
    "I should think rather mature perhaps.",
    "Lumpy said Mrs Oliver.",
    "Well developed You mean sexy looking.",
    "Yes that is what I mean.",
    "But I dont think that was the kind of crime it was  I mean that would have been more\nsimple wouldnt it\nIt is the kind of crime said Poirot of which one reads every day in the paper.",
    "A girl who is attacked a school\nchild who is assaulted  yes every day.",
    "This happened in a private house which makes it different but perhaps not\nso different as all that.",
    "But all the same Im not sure yet that youve told me everything.",
    "No I dont suppose I have said Mrs Oliver.",
    "I havent told you the reason I mean why I came to you.",
    "You knew this Joyce you knew her well\nI didnt know her at all.",
    "Id better explain to you I think just how I came to be there.",
    "There is where\nOh a place called Woodleigh Common.",
    "Woodleigh Common said Poirot thoughtfully.",
    "Not where lately  he broke off.",
    "Its not very far from London.",
    "About  oh thirty to forty miles I think.",
    "Its near Medchester.",
    "Its one of those places\nwhere there are a few nice houses but where a certain amount of new building has been done.",
    "Residential.",
    "A good\nschool nearby and people can commute from there to London or into Medchester.",
    "Its quite an ordinary sort of place\nwhere people with what you might call everyday reasonable incomes live.",
    "Woodleigh Common said Poirot again thoughtfully.",
    "I was staying with a friend there.",
    "Judith Butler.",
    "Shes a widow.",
    "I went on a Hellenic cruise this year and Judith was\non the cruise and we became friends.",
    "Shes got a daughter a girl called Miranda who is twelve or thirteen.",
    "Anyway\nshe asked me to come and stay and she said friends of hers were giving this party for children and it was to be a\nHalloween party.",
    "She said perhaps I had some interesting ideas.",
    "Ah said Poirot she did not suggest this time that you should arrange a murder hunt or anything of that kind\nGood gracious no said Mrs Oliver.",
    "Do you think I should ever consider such a thing again\nI should think it unlikely.",
    "But it happened thats what is so awful said Mrs Oliver.",
    "I mean it couldnt have happened just because I was\nthere could it\nI do not think so.",
    "At least  Did any of the people at the party know who you were\nYes said Mrs Oliver.",
    "One of the children said something about my writing books and that they liked murders.",
    "Thats how it  well thats what led to the thing...",
    "I mean to the thing that made me come to you.",
    "Which you still havent told me.",
    "Well you see at first I didnt think of it.",
    "Not straight away.",
    "I mean children do queer things sometimes.",
    "I mean\nthere are queer children about children who  well once I suppose they would have been in mental homes and\nthings but they send them home now and tell them to lead ordinary lives or something and then they go and do\nsomething like this.",
    "There were some young adolescents there\nThere were two boys or youths as they always seem to call them in police reports.",
    "About sixteen to eighteen.",
    "I suppose one of them might have done it.",
    "Is that what the police think\nThey dont say what they think said Mrs Oliver but they looked as though they might think so.",
    "Was this Joyce an attractive girl\nI dont think so said Mrs Oliver.",
    "You mean attractive to boys do you\nNo said Poirot I think I meant  well just the plain simple meaning of the word.",
    "I dont think she was a very nice girl said Mrs Oliver not one youd want to talk to much.",
    "She was the sort of girl\nwho shows off and boasts.",
    "Its a rather tiresome age I think.",
    "It sounds unkind what Im saying but \nIt is not unkind in murder to say what the victim was like said Poirot.",
    "It is very very necessary.",
    "The personality\nof the victim is the cause of many a murder.",
    "How many people were there in the house at the time\nYou mean for the party and so on Well I suppose there were five or six women some mothers a schoolteacher a\ndoctors wife or sister I think a couple of middleaged married people the two boys of sixteen to eighteen a girl of\nfifteen two or three of eleven or twelve well that sort of thing.",
    "About twentyfive or thirty in all perhaps.",
    "Any strangers\nThey all knew each other I think.",
    "Some better than others.",
    "I think the girls were mostly in the same school.",
    "There\nwere a couple of women who had come in to help with the food and the supper and things like that.",
    "When the party\nended most of the mothers went home with their children.",
    "I stayed behind with Judith and a couple of others to help\nRowena Drake the woman who gave the party to clear up a bit so the cleaning women who came in the morning\nwouldnt have so much mess to deal with.",
    "You know there was a lot of flour about and paper caps out of crackers\nand different things.",
    "So we swept up a bit and we got to the library last of all.",
    "And thats when  when we found her.",
    "And then I remembered what shed said.",
    "What who had said\nJoyce.",
    "What did she say We are coming to it now are we not We are coming to the reason why you are here\nYes.",
    "I thought it wouldnt mean anything to  oh to a doctor or the police or anyone but I thought it might mean\nsomething to you.",
    "Eh bien said Poirot tell me.",
    "Was this something Joyce said at the party\n\n\fNo  earlier in the day.",
    "That afternoon when we were fixing things up.",
    "It was after theyd talked about my writing\nmurder stories and Joyce said I saw a murder once and her mother or somebody said Dont be silly Joyce saying\nthings like that and one of the older girls said Youre just making it up and Joyce said I did.",
    "I saw it.",
    "I tell you.",
    "I\ndid.",
    "I saw someone do a murder but no one believed her.",
    "They just laughed and she got very angry.",
    "Did you believe her\nNo of course not.",
    "I see said Poirot yes I see.",
    "He was silent for some moments tapping a finger on the table.",
    "Then he said I wonder  she gave no details  no\nnames\nNo.",
    "She went on boasting and shouting a bit and being angry because most of the other girls were laughing at her.",
    "The mothers I think and the older people were rather cross with her.",
    "But the girls and the younger boys just\nlaughed at her They said things like Go on Joyce when was this Why did you never tell us about it And Joyce\nsaid Id forgotten all about it it was so long ago.",
    "Aha Did she say how long ago\nYears ago she said.",
    "You know in rather a wouldbe grownup way.",
    "Why didnt you go and tell the police then one of the girls said.",
    "Ann I think or Beatrice.",
    "Rather a smug superior\ngirl.",
    "Aha and what did she say to that\nShe said Because I didnt know at the time it was a murder.",
    "A very interesting remark said Poirot sitting up rather straighter in his chair.",
    "Shed got a bit mixed up by then I think said Mrs Oliver.",
    "You know trying to explain herself and getting angry\nbecause they were all teasing her.",
    "They kept asking her why she hadnt gone to the police and she kept on saying\nBecause I didnt know then that it was a murder.",
    "It wasnt until afterwards that it came to me quite suddenly that that\nwas what I had seen.",
    "But nobody showed any signs of believing her  and you yourself did not believe her  but when you came across\nher dead you suddenly felt that she might have been speaking the truth\nYes just that.",
    "I didnt know what I ought to do or what I could do.",
    "But then later I thought of you.",
    "Poirot bowed his head gravely in acknowledgment.",
    "He was silent for a moment or two then he said\nI must pose to you a serious question and reflect before you answer it.",
    "Do you think that this girl had really seen a\nmurder Or do you think that she merely believed that she had seen a murder\nThe first I think said Mrs Oliver.",
    "I didnt at the time.",
    "I just thought that she was vaguely remembering something\nshe had once seen and was working it up to make it sound important and exciting.",
    "She became very vehement\nsaying I did see it I tell you.",
    "I did see it happen.",
    "And so.",
    "And so Ive come along to you said Mrs Oliver because the only way her death makes sense is that there really\n\n\fwas a murder and that she was witness to it.",
    "That would involve certain things.",
    "It would involve that one of the people who were at the party committed the\nmurder and that that same person must also have been there earlier that day and have heard what Joyce said.",
    "You dont think Im just imagining things do you said Mrs Oliver.",
    "Do you think that it is all just my very\nfarfetched imagination\nA girl was murdered said Poirot.",
    "Murdered by someone who had strength enough to hold her head down in a\nbucket of water.",
    "An ugly murder and a murder that was committed with what we might call no time to lose.",
    "Somebody was threatened and whoever it was struck as soon as it was humanly possible.",
    "Joyce could not have known who it was who did the murder she saw said Mrs Oliver.",
    "I mean she wouldnt have\nsaid what she did if there was someone actually in the room who was concerned.",
    "No said Poirot I think you are right there.",
    "She saw a murder but she did not see the murderers face.",
    "We have to\ngo beyond that.",
    "I dont understand exactly what you mean.",
    "It could be that someone who was there earlier in the day and heard Joyces accusation knew about the murder\nknew who committed the murder perhaps was closely involved with that person.",
    "It may have been that that\nsomeone thought he was the only person who knew what his wife had done or his mother or his daughter or his son.",
    "Or it might have been a woman who knew what her husband or mother or daughter or son had done.",
    "Someone who\nthought that no one else knew.",
    "And then Joyce began talking...\nAnd so  Joyce had to die\nYes.",
    "What are you going to do\nI have just remembered said Hercule Poirot why the name of Woodleigh Common was familiar to me.",
    "Chapter 5\nHercule Poirot looked over the small gate which gave admission to Pine Crest.",
    "It was a modern perky little house\nnicely built.",
    "Hercule Poirot was slightly out of breath.",
    "The small neat house in front of him was very suitably\nnamed.",
    "It was on a hill top and the hill top was planted with a few sparse pines.",
    "It had a small neat garden and a\nlarge elderly man was trundling along a path with a big tin galvanised waterer.",
    "Superintendent Spences hair was now grey all over instead of having a neat touch of grey hair at the temples.",
    "He\nhad not shrunk much in girth.",
    "He stopped trundling his can and looking at the visitor at the gate.",
    "Hercule Poirot\nstood there without moving.",
    "God bless my soul said Superintendent Spence.",
    "It must be.",
    "It cant be but it is.",
    "Yes it must be.",
    "Hercule Poirot as\nI live.",
    "Aha said Hercule Poirot you know me.",
    "That is gratifying.",
    "May your moustaches never grow less said Spence.",
    "He abandoned the watering can and came down to the gate.",
    "Diabolical weeds he said.",
    "And what brings you down here\nWhat has brought me to many places in my time said Hercule Poirot and what once a good many years ago\nbrought you to see me.",
    "Murder.",
    "Ive done with murder said Spence except in the case of weeds.",
    "Thats what Im doing now.",
    "Applying weed\n\n\fkiller.",
    "Never so easy as you think somethings always wrong usually the weather.",
    "Mustnt be too wet mustnt be too dry and all the rest of it.",
    "How did you know where to find me he asked as he\nunlatched the gate and Poirot passed through.",
    "You sent me a Christmas card.",
    "It had your new address notified on it.",
    "Ah yes so I did.",
    "Im oldfashioned you know.",
    "I like to send round cards at Christmas time to a few old friends.",
    "I appreciate that said Poirot.",
    "Spence said Im an old man now.",
    "We are both old men.",
    "Not much grey in your hair said Spence.",
    "I attend to that with a bottle said Hercule Poirot.",
    "There is no need to appear in public with grey hair unless you\nwish to do so.",
    "Well I dont think jet black would suit me said Spence.",
    "I agree said Poirot.",
    "You look most distinguished with grey hair.",
    "I should never think of myself as a distinguished man.",
    "I think of you as such.",
    "Why have you come to live in Woodleigh Common\nAs a matter of fact I came here to join forces with a sister of mine.",
    "She lost her husband her children are married\nand living abroad one in Australia and the other in South Africa.",
    "So I moved in here.",
    "Pensions dont go far\nnowadays but we do pretty comfortably living together.",
    "Come and sit down.",
    "He led the way on to the small glazedin verandah where there were chairs and a table or two.",
    "The autumn sun fell pleasantly upon this retreat.",
    "What shall I get you said Spence.",
    "No fancy stuff here Im afraid.",
    "No black currant or rose hip syrup or any of\nyour patent things.",
    "Beer Or shall I get Elspeth to make you a cup of tea Or I can do you a shandy or CocaCola or\nsome cocoa if you like it.",
    "My sister Elspeth is a cocoa drinker.",
    "You are very kind.",
    "For me I think a shandy.",
    "The ginger beer and the beer That is right is it not\nAbsolutely so.",
    "He went into the house and returned shortly afterwards carrying two large glass mugs.",
    "Im joining you he said.",
    "He drew a chair up to the table and sat down placing the two glasses in front of himself and Poirot.",
    "What was it you said just now he said raising his glass.",
    "We wont say Heres to crime.",
    "Ive done with crime and if you mean the crime I think you do in fact which I think\nyou have to do because I dont recall any other crime just lately I dont like the particular form of murder weve just\nhad.",
    "No I do not think you would do so.",
    "We are talking about the child who had her head shoved into a bucket\nYes said Poirot that is what I am talking about.",
    "I dont know why you come to me said Spence.",
    "Im nothing to do with the police nowadays.",
    "All thats over many\nyears ago.",
    "Once a policeman said Hercule Poirot always a policeman.",
    "That is to say there is always the point of view of\nthe policeman behind the point of view of the ordinary man.",
    "I know I who talk to you.",
    "I too started in the police\nforce in my country.",
    "Yes so you did.",
    "I remember now your telling me.",
    "Well I suppose ones outlook is a bit slanted but its a long time\nsince Ive had any active connection.",
    "But you hear the gossip said Poirot.",
    "You have friends of your own trade.",
    "You will hear what they think or\nsuspect or what they know.",
    "Spence sighed.",
    "One knows too much he said that is one of the troubles nowadays.",
    "There is a crime a crime of which the pattern\nis familiar and you know that is to say the active police officers know pretty well whos probably done that crime.",
    "They dont tell the newspapers but they make their inquiries and they know.",
    "But whether theyre going to get any\nfurther than that  well things have their difficulties.",
    "You mean the wives and the girl friends and the rest of it\nPartly that yes.",
    "In the end perhaps one gets ones man.",
    "Sometimes a year or two passes.",
    "Id say you know\nroughly Poirot that more girls nowadays marry wrong uns than they ever used to in my time.",
    "Hercule Poirot considered pulling his moustaches.",
    "Yes he said I can see that that might be so.",
    "I suspect that girls have always been partial to the bad lots as you\nsay but in the past there were safeguards.",
    "Thats right.",
    "People were looking after them.",
    "Their mothers looked after them.",
    "Their aunts and their older sisters\nlooked after them.",
    "Their younger sisters and brothers knew what was going on.",
    "Their fathers were not averse to\nkicking the wrong young men out of the house.",
    "Sometimes of course the girls used to run away with one of the bad\nlots.",
    "Nowadays theres no need even to do that.",
    "Mother doesnt know who the girls out with fathers not told who\nthe girl is out with brothers know who the girl is out with but they think more fool her.",
    "If the parents refuse\nconsent the couple go before a magistrate and manage to get permission to marry and then when the young man\nwho everyone knows is a bad lot proceeds to prove to everybody including his wife that he is a bad lot the fats in\nthe fire But loves love the girl doesnt want to think that her Henry has these revolting habits these criminal\ntendencies and all the rest of it.",
    "Shell lie for him swear blacks white for him and everything else.",
    "Yes its difficult.",
    "Difficult for us I mean.",
    "Well theres no good going on saying things were better in the old days.",
    "Perhaps we only\nthought so.",
    "Anyway Poirot how did you get yourself mixed up in all this This isnt your part of the country is it\nAlways thought you lived in London.",
    "You used to when I knew you.",
    "I still live in London.",
    "I involved myself here at the request of a friend Mrs Oliver.",
    "You remember Mrs Oliver\nSpence raised his head closed his eyes and appeared to reflect.",
    "Mrs Oliver Cant say that I do.",
    "She writes books.",
    "Detective stories.",
    "You met her if you will throw your mind back during the time that you\npersuaded me to investigate the murder of Mrs McGinty.",
    "You will not have forgotten Mrs McGinty\nGood lord no.",
    "But it was a long time ago.",
    "You did me a good turn there Poirot a very good turn.",
    "I went to you for\nhelp and you didnt let me down.",
    "I was honoured  flattered that you should come to consult me said Poirot.",
    "I must say that I despaired once or twice.",
    "The man we had to save  to save his neck in those days I believe it is\nlong ago enough for that  was a man who was excessively difficult to do anything for.",
    "The kind of standard\nexample of how not to do anything useful for himself.",
    "Married that girl didnt he The wet one.",
    "Not the bright one with the peroxide hair.",
    "Wonder how they got on\ntogether.",
    "Have you ever heard about it\nNo said Poirot.",
    "I presume all goes well with them.",
    "Cant see what she saw in him.",
    "It is difficult said Poirot but it is one of the great consolations in nature that a man however unattractive will\nfind that he is attractive  even what appears to be madly attractive  to some woman.",
    "One can only say or hope that\nthey married and lived happily ever afterwards.",
    "Shouldnt think they lived happily ever afterwards if they had to have Mother to live with them.",
    "No indeed said Poirot.",
    "Or Stepfather he added.",
    "Well said Spence here we are talking of old days again.",
    "All thats over.",
    "I always thought that man cant\nremember his name now ought to have run an undertaking parlour.",
    "Had just the face and manner for it.",
    "Perhaps he\ndid.",
    "The girl had some money didnt she Yes hed have made a very good undertaker.",
    "I can see him all in black\ncalling for orders for the funeral.",
    "Perhaps he can even have been enthusiastic over the right kind of elm or teak or\nwhatever they use for coffins.",
    "But hed never have made good selling insurance or real estate.",
    "Anyway dont lets\nharp back.",
    "Then he said suddenly Mrs Oliver.",
    "Ariadne Oliver.",
    "Apples.",
    "Is that how shes got herself mixed up in this That\npoor child got her head shoved under water in a bucket of floating apples didnt she at a party Is that what\ninterested Mrs Oliver\nI dont think she was particularly attracted because of the apples said Poirot but she was at the party.",
    "Do you say she lived here\nNo she does not live here.",
    "She was staying with a friend a Mrs Butler.",
    "Butler Yes I know her.",
    "Lives down not far from the church.",
    "Widow.",
    "Husband was an airline pilot.",
    "Has a\ndaughter.",
    "Rather nicelooking girl.",
    "Pretty manners.",
    "Mrs Butlers rather an attractive woman dont you think so\nI have as yet barely met her but yes I thought she was very attractive.",
    "And how does this concern you Poirot You werent here when it happened\nNo.",
    "Mrs Oliver came to me in London.",
    "She was upset very upset.",
    "She wanted me to do something.",
    "A faint smile showed on Superintendent Spences face.",
    "I see.",
    "Same old story.",
    "I came up to you too because I wanted you to do something.",
    "And I have carried things one step further said Poirot.",
    "I have come to you.",
    "Because you want me to do something I tell you theres nothing I can do.",
    "Oh yes there is.",
    "You can tell me all about the people.",
    "The people who live here.",
    "The people who went to that party.",
    "The fathers and mothers of the children who were at the party.",
    "The school the teachers the lawyers the doctors.",
    "Somebody during a party induced a child to kneel down and perhaps laughing saying Ill show you the best way\nto get hold of an apple with your teeth.",
    "I know the trick of it.",
    "And then he or she  whoever it was  put a hand on\nthat girls head.",
    "There wouldnt have been much struggle or noise or anything of that kind.",
    "A nasty business said Spence.",
    "I thought so when I heard about it.",
    "What do you want to know Ive been here a\nyear.",
    "My sisters been here longer  two or three years.",
    "Its not a big community.",
    "Its not a particularly settled one\neither.",
    "People come and go.",
    "The husband has a job in either Medchester or Great Canning or one of the other places\n\n\fround about.",
    "Their children go to school here.",
    "Then perhaps the husband changes his job and they go somewhere\nelse.",
    "Its not a fixed community.",
    "Some of the people have been here a long time.",
    "Miss Emlyn the schoolmistress\nhas.",
    "Dr Ferguson has.",
    "But on the whole it fluctuates a bit.",
    "One supposes said Hercule Poirot that having agreed with you that this was a nasty business I might hope that\nyou would know who are the nasty people here.",
    "Yes said Spence.",
    "Its the first thing one looks for isnt it And the next thing one looks for is a nasty adolescent\nin a thing of this kind.",
    "Who wants to strangle or drown or get rid of a lump of a girl of thirteen There doesnt seem\nto have been any evidence of a sexual assault or anything of that kind which would be the first thing one looks for.",
    "Plenty of that sort of thing in every small town or village nowadays.",
    "There again I think theres more of it than there\nused to be in my young day.",
    "We had our mentally disturbed or whatever they call them but not so many as we have\nnow.",
    "I expect there are more of them let out of the place they ought to be kept safe in.",
    "All our mental homes are too\nfull overcrowded so doctors say Let him or her lead a normal life.",
    "Go back and live with his relatives etc.",
    "And\nthen the nasty bit of goods or the poor afflicted fellow whichever way you look at it gets the urge again and\nanother young woman goes out walking and is found in a gravel pit or is silly enough to take lifts in a car.",
    "Children\ndont come home from school because theyve accepted a lift from a stranger although theyve been warned not to.",
    "Yes theres a lot of that nowadays.",
    "Does that quite fit the pattern we have here\nWell its the first thing one thinks of said Spence.",
    "Somebody was at the party who had the urge shall we say.",
    "Perhaps hed done it before perhaps hed only wanted to do it.",
    "Id say roughly that there might be some past history\nof assaulting a child somewhere.",
    "As far as I know nobodys come up with anything of that kind.",
    "Not officially I\nmean.",
    "There were two in the right age group at the party.",
    "Nicholas Ransom nicelooking lad seventeen or eighteen.",
    "Hed be the right age.",
    "Comes from the East Coast or somewhere like that I think.",
    "Seems all right.",
    "Looks normal\nenough but who knows And theres Desmond recommended once for a psychiatric report but I wouldnt say there\nwas much to it.",
    "Its got to be someone at the party though of course I suppose anyone could have come in from\noutside.",
    "A house isnt usually locked up during a party.",
    "Theres a side door open or a side window.",
    "One of our halfbaked people I suppose could have come along to see what was on and sneaked in.",
    "A pretty big risk to take.",
    "Would\na child agree a child whod gone to a party to go playing apple games with anyone she didnt know Anyway you\nhavent explained yet Poirot what brings you into it.",
    "You said it was Mrs Oliver.",
    "Some wild idea of hers\nNot exactly a wild idea said Poirot.",
    "It is true that writers are prone to wild ideas.",
    "Ideas perhaps which are on the\nfar side of probability.",
    "But this was simply something that she heard the girl say.",
    "What the child Joyce\nYes.",
    "Spence leant forward and looked at Poirot inquiringly.",
    "I will tell you said Poirot.",
    "Quietly and succinctly he recounted the story as Mrs Oliver had told it to him.",
    "I see said Spence.",
    "He rubbed his moustache.",
    "The girl said that did she\nSaid shed seen a murder committed.",
    "Did she say when or how\nNo said Poirot.",
    "What led up to it\nSome remark I think about the murders in Mrs Olivers books.",
    "Somebody said something about it to Mrs Oliver.",
    "One of the children I think to the effect that there wasnt enough blood in her books or enough bodies.",
    "And then\nJoyce spoke up and said shed seen a murder once.",
    "Boasted of it Thats the impression youre giving me.",
    "Thats the impression Mrs Oliver got.",
    "Yes she boasted of it.",
    "It mightnt have been true.",
    "No it might not have been true at all said Poirot.",
    "Children often make these extravagant statements when they wish to call attention to themselves or to make an\neffect.",
    "On the other hand it might have been true.",
    "Is that what you think\nI do not know said Poirot.",
    "A child boasts of having witnessed a murder.",
    "Only a few hours later that child is\ndead.",
    "You must admit that there are grounds for believing that it might  its a farfetched idea perhaps  but it might\nhave been cause and effect.",
    "If so somebody lost no time.",
    "Definitely said Spence.",
    "How many were present at the time the girl made her statement re murder do you know\nexactly\nAll that Mrs Oliver said was that she thought there were about fourteen or fifteen people perhaps more.",
    "Five or six\nchildren five or six grownups who were running the show.",
    "But for exact information I must rely on you.",
    "Well that will be easy enough said Spence.",
    "I dont say I know offhand at the moment but its easily obtained\nfrom the locals.",
    "As to the party itself I know pretty well already.",
    "A preponderance of women on the whole.",
    "Fathers\ndont turn up much at childrens parties.",
    "But they look in sometimes or come to take their children home.",
    "Dr\nFerguson was there the vicar was there.",
    "Otherwise mothers aunts social workers two teachers from the school.",
    "Oh I can give you a list of roughly about fourteen children.",
    "The youngest not more than ten running on into\nteenagers.",
    "And I suppose you would know the list of probables amongst them said Poirot.",
    "Well it wont be so easy now if what you think is true.",
    "You mean you are no longer looking for a sexually disturbed personality.",
    "You are looking instead for somebody\nwho has committed a murder and got away with it someone who never expected it to be found out and who\nsuddenly got a nasty shock.",
    "Blest if I can think who it could have been all the same said Spence.",
    "I shouldnt have said we had any likely\nmurderers round here.",
    "And certainly nothing spectacular in the way of murders.",
    "One can have likely murderers anywhere said Poirot or shall I say unlikely murderers but nevertheless\nmurderers.",
    "Because unlikely murderers are not so prone to be suspected.",
    "There is probably not very much evidence\nagainst them and it would be a rude shock to such a murderer to find that there had actually been an eyewitness to\nhis or her crime.",
    "Why didnt Joyce say anything at the time Thats what Id like to know.",
    "Was she bribed to silence by someone do\nyou think Too risky surely.",
    "No said Poirot.",
    "I gather from what Mrs Oliver mentioned that she didnt recognise that it was a murder she was\nlooking at at the time.",
    "Oh surely thats most unlikely said Spence.",
    "Not necessarily said Poirot.",
    "A child of thirteen was speaking.",
    "She was remembering something shed seen in the\npast.",
    "We dont know exactly when.",
    "It might have been three or even four years previously.",
    "She saw something but\nshe didnt realise its true significance.",
    "That might apply to a lot of things you know mon cher.",
    "Some rather peculiar\ncar accident.",
    "A car where it appeared that the driver drove straight at the person who was injured or perhaps killed.",
    "A child might not realise it was deliberate at the time.",
    "But something someone said or something she saw or heard a\nyear or two later might awaken her memory and shed think perhaps A or B or X did it on purpose.",
    "Perhaps it was\n\n\freally a murder not just an accident.",
    "And there are plenty of other possibilities.",
    "Some of them I will admit\nsuggested by my friend Mrs Oliver who can easily come up with about twelve different solutions to everything\nmost of them not very probable but all of them faintly possible.",
    "Tablets added to a cup of tea administered to\nsomeone.",
    "Roughly that sort of thing.",
    "A push perhaps on a dangerous spot.",
    "You have no cliffs here which is rather a\npity from the point of view of likely theories.",
    "Yes I think there could be plenty of possibilities.",
    "Perhaps it is some\nmurder story that the girl reads which recalls to her an incident.",
    "It may have been an incident that puzzled her at the\ntime and she might when she reads the story say Well that might have been soandso and soandso.",
    "I wonder if\nhe or she did it on purpose Yes there are a lot of possibilities.",
    "And you have come here to inquire into them\nIt would be in the public interest I think dont you said Poirot.",
    "Ah were to be public spirited are we you and I\nYou can at least give me information said Poirot.",
    "You know the people here.",
    "Ill do what I can said Spence.",
    "And Ill rope in Elspeth.",
    "Theres not much about people she doesnt know.",
    "Chapter 6\nSatisfied with what he had achieved Poirot took leave of his friend.",
    "The information he wanted would be\nforthcoming  he had no doubt as to that.",
    "He had got Spence interested.",
    "And Spence once set upon a trail was not\none to relinquish it.",
    "His reputation as a retired highranking officer of the CID would have won him friends in the\nlocal police departments concerned.",
    "And next  Poirot consulted his watch  he was to meet Mrs Oliver in exactly\nten minutes time outside a house called Apple Trees.",
    "Really the name seemed uncannily appropriate.",
    "Really thought Poirot one didnt seem able to get away from apples.",
    "Nothing could be more agreeable than a juicy\nEnglish apple  And yet here were apples mixed up with broomsticks and witches and oldfashioned folklore and a\nmurdered child.",
    "Following the route indicated to him Poirot arrived to the minute outside a red brick Georgian style house with a\nneat beech hedge enclosing it and a pleasant garden showing beyond.",
    "He put his hand out raised the latch and entered through the wrought iron gate which bore a painted board labelled\nApple Trees.",
    "A path led up to the front door.",
    "Looking rather like one of those Swiss clocks where figures come\nout automatically of a door above the clock face the front door opened and Mrs Oliver emerged on the steps.",
    "Youre absolutely punctual she said breathlessly.",
    "I was watching for you from the window.",
    "Poirot turned and closed the gate carefully behind him.",
    "Practically on every occasion that he had met Mrs Oliver\nwhether by appointment or by accident a motif of apples seemed to be introduced almost immediately.",
    "She was\neither eating an apple or had been eating an apple  witness an apple core nestling on her broad chest  or was\ncarrying a bag of apples.",
    "But today there was no apple in evidence at all.",
    "Very correct Poirot thought approvingly.",
    "It\nwould have been in very bad taste to be gnawing an apple here on the scene of what had been not only a crime but a\ntragedy.",
    "For what else can it be but that thought Poirot.",
    "The sudden death of a child of only thirteen years old.",
    "He\ndid not like to think of it and because he did not like to think of it he was all the more decided in his mind that that\nwas exactly what he was going to think of until by some means or other light should shine out of the darkness and\nhe should see clearly what he had come here to see.",
    "I cant think why you wouldnt come and stay with Judith Butler said Mrs Oliver.",
    "Instead of going to a fifthclass\nguest house.",
    "Because it is better that I should survey things with a certain degree of aloofness said Poirot.",
    "One must not get\ninvolved you comprehend.",
    "I dont see how you can avoid getting involved said Mrs Oliver.",
    "Youve got to see everyone and talk to them\nhavent you\n\n\fThat most decidedly said Poirot.",
    "Who have you seen so far\nMy friend Superintendent Spence.",
    "Whats he like nowadays said Mrs Oliver.",
    "A good deal older than he was said Poirot.",
    "Naturally said Mrs Oliver what else would you expect Is he deafer or blinder or fatter or thinner\nPoirot considered.",
    "He has lost a little weight.",
    "He wears spectacles for reading the paper.",
    "I do not think he is deaf not to any noticeable\nextent.",
    "And what does he think about it all\nYou go too quickly said Poirot.",
    "And what exactly are you and he going to do\nI have planned my programme said Poirot.",
    "First I have seen and consulted with my old friend.",
    "I asked him to get\nme perhaps some information that would not be easy to get otherwise.",
    "You mean the police here will be his buddies and hell get a lot of inside stuff from them\nWell I should not put it exactly like that but yes those are the lines along which I have been thinking.",
    "And after that\nI come to meet you here Madame.",
    "I have to see just where this thing happened.",
    "Mrs Oliver turned her head and\nlooked up at the house.",
    "It doesnt look the sort of house thered be a murder in does it she said.",
    "Poirot thought again What an unerring\ninstinct she has\nNo he said it does not look at all that sort of a house.",
    "After I have seen where then I go with you to see the\nmother of the dead child.",
    "I hear what she can tell me.",
    "This afternoon my friend Spence is making an appointment for\nme to talk with the local inspector at a suitable hour.",
    "I should also like a talk with the doctor here.",
    "And possibly the\nheadmistress at the school.",
    "At six oclock I drink tea and eat sausages with my friend Spence and his sister again in\ntheir house and we discuss.",
    "What more do you think hell be able to tell you\nI want to meet his sister.",
    "She has lived here longer than he has.",
    "He came here to join her when her husband died.",
    "She will know perhaps the people here fairly well.",
    "Do you know what you sound like said Mrs Oliver.",
    "A computer.",
    "You know.",
    "Youre programming yourself.",
    "Thats what they call it isnt it I mean youre feeding all these things into yourself all day and then youre going to\nsee what comes out.",
    "It is certainly an idea you have there said Poirot with some interest.",
    "Yes yes I play the part of the computer.",
    "One feeds in the information \nAnd supposing you come up with all the wrong answers said Mrs Oliver.",
    "That would be impossible said Hercule Poirot.",
    "Computers do not do that sort of a thing.",
    "Theyre not supposed to said Mrs Oliver but youd be surprised at the things that happen sometimes.",
    "My last\nelectric light bill for instance.",
    "I know theres a proverb which says To err is human but a human error is nothing to\nwhat a computer can do if it tries.",
    "Come on in and meet Mrs Drake.",
    "Mrs Drake was certainly something Poirot\nthought.",
    "She was a tall handsome woman of fortyodd her golden hair was lightly tinged with grey her eyes were\nbrilliantly blue she oozed competence from the fingertips downwards.",
    "Any party she had arranged would have been\na successful one.",
    "In the drawingroom a tray of morning coffee with two sugared biscuits was awaiting them.",
    "Apple\nTrees he saw was a most admirably kept house.",
    "It was well furnished it had carpets of excellent quality everything\nwas scrupulously polished and cleaned and the fact that it had hardly any outstanding object of interest in it was not\nreadily noticeable.",
    "One would not have expected it.",
    "The colours of the curtains and the covers were pleasant but\nconventional.",
    "It could have been let furnished at any moment for a high rent to a desirable tenant without having to\nput away any treasures or make any alterations to the arrangement of the furniture.",
    "Mrs Drake greeted Mrs Oliver and Poirot and concealed almost entirely what Poirot could not help suspecting was a\nfeeling of vigorously suppressed annoyance at the position in which she found herself as the hostess at a social\noccasion at which something as antisocial as murder had occurred.",
    "As a prominent member of the community of\nWoodleigh Common he suspected that she felt an unhappy sense of having herself in some way proved inadequate.",
    "What had occurred should not have occurred.",
    "To someone else in someone elses house  yes.",
    "But at a party for\nchildren arranged by her given by her organised by her nothing like this ought to have happened.",
    "Somehow or\nother she ought to have seen to it that it did not happen.",
    "And Poirot also had a suspicion that she was seeking round\nirritably in the back of her mind for a reason.",
    "Not so much a reason for murder having taken place but to find out\nand pin down some inadequacy on the part of someone who had been helping her and who had by some\nmismanagement or some lack of perception failed to realise that something like this could happen.",
    "Monsieur Poirot said Mrs Drake in her fine speaking voice which Poirot thought would come over excellently in\na small lecture room or the village hall\nI am so pleased you could come down here.",
    "Mrs Oliver has been telling me how invaluable your help will be to us\nin this terrible crisis.",
    "Rest assured Madame I shall do what I can but as you no doubt realise from your experience of life it is going to\nbe a difficult business.",
    "Difficult said Mrs Drake.",
    "Of course its going to be difficult.",
    "It seems incredible absolutely incredible that such\nan awful thing should have happened.",
    "I suppose she added the police may know something Inspector Raglan\nhas a very good reputation locally I believe.",
    "Whether or not they ought to call Scotland Yard in I dont know.",
    "The\nidea seems to be that this poor childs death must have had a local significance.",
    "I neednt tell you Monsieur Poirot\nafter all you read the papers as much as I do that there have been very many sad fatalities with children all over the\ncountryside.",
    "They seem to be getting more and more frequent.",
    "Mental instability seems to be on the increase though\nI must say that mothers and families generally are not looking after their children properly as they used to do.",
    "Children are sent home from school alone on dark evenings go alone on dark early mornings.",
    "And children\nhowever much you warn them are unfortunately very foolish when it comes to being offered a lift in a smartlooking car.",
    "They believe what theyre told.",
    "I suppose one cannot help that.",
    "But what happened here Madame was of an entirely different nature.",
    "Oh I know  I know.",
    "That is why I used the term incredible.",
    "I still cannot quite believe it said Mrs Drake.",
    "Everything was entirely under control.",
    "All the arrangements were made.",
    "Everything was going perfectly all\naccording to plan.",
    "It just seems  seems incredible.",
    "Personally I consider myself that there must be what I call an\noutside significance to this.",
    "Someone walked into the house  not a difficult thing to do under the circumstances someone of highly disturbed mentality I suppose the kind of people who are let out of mental homes simply\nbecause there is no room for them there as far as I can see.",
    "Nowadays room has to be made for fresh patients all the\ntime.",
    "Anyone peeping in through a window could see a childrens party was going on and this poor wretch\n if one can really feel pity for these people which I really must say I find it very hard to do myself sometimes enticed this child away somehow and killed her.",
    "You cant think such a thing could happen but it did happen.",
    "Perhaps you would show me where \n\n\fOf course.",
    "No more coffee\nI thank you no.",
    "Mrs Drake got up.",
    "The police seem to think it took place while the Snapdragon was going on.",
    "That was taking place in the diningroom.",
    "She walked across the hall opened the door and rather in the manner of someone doing the honours of a stately\nhome to a party of charabanc goers indicated the large diningtable and the heavy velvet curtains.",
    "It was dark here of course except for the blazing dish.",
    "And now  She led them across the hall and opened the\ndoor of a small room with armchairs sporting prints and bookshelves.",
    "The library said Mrs Drake and shivered a little.",
    "The bucket was here.",
    "On a plastic sheet of course \nMrs Oliver had not accompanied them into the room.",
    "She was standing outside in the hall.",
    "I cant come in she said to Poirot.",
    "It makes me think of it too much.",
    "Theres nothing to see now said Mrs Drake.",
    "I mean Im just showing you where as you asked.",
    "I suppose said Poirot there was water  a good deal of water.",
    "There was water in the bucket of course said Mrs Drake.",
    "She looked at Poirot as though she thought that he was\nnot quite all there.",
    "And there was water on the sheet.",
    "I mean if the childs head was pushed under water there would be a lot of water\nsplashed about.",
    "Oh yes.",
    "Even while the bobbing was going on the bucket had to be filled up once or twice.",
    "So the person who did it That person also would have got wet one would think.",
    "Yes yes I suppose so.",
    "That was not specially noticed\nNo no the Inspector asked me about that.",
    "You see by the end of the evening nearly everyone was a bit dishevelled\nor damp or floury.",
    "There doesnt seem to be any useful clues there at all.",
    "I mean the police didnt think so.",
    "No said Poirot.",
    "I suppose the only clue was the child herself.",
    "I hope you will tell me all you know about her.",
    "About Joyce\nMrs Drake looked slightly taken aback.",
    "It was as though Joyce in her mind had by now retreated so far out of things that she was quite surprised to be\nreminded of her.",
    "The victim is always important said Poirot.",
    "The victim you see is so often the cause of the crime.",
    "Well I suppose yes I see what you mean said Mrs Drake who quite plainly did not.",
    "Shall we come back to the\ndrawingroom\nAnd then you will tell me all about Joyce said Poirot.",
    "They settled themselves once more in the drawingroom.",
    "Mrs Drake was looking uncomfortable.",
    "I dont know really what you expect me to say Monsieur Poirot she said.",
    "Surely all information can be obtained quite easily from the police or from Joyces mother.",
    "Poor woman it will be\npainful for her no doubt but \nBut what I want said Poirot is not a mothers estimate of a dead daughter.",
    "It is a clear unbiased opinion from\nsomeone who has a good knowledge of human nature.",
    "I should say Madame that you yourself have been an active\nworker in many welfare and social fields here.",
    "Nobody I am sure could sum up more aptly the character and\ndisposition of someone whom you know.",
    "Well it is a little difficult.",
    "I mean children of that age  she was thirteen I think twelve or thirteen  are very much\nalike at a certain age.",
    "Ah no surely not said Poirot.",
    "There are very great differences in character in disposition.",
    "Did you like her\nMrs Drake seemed to find the question embarrassing.",
    "Well of course I  I liked her.",
    "I mean well I like all children.",
    "Most people do.",
    "Ah there I do not agree with you said Poirot.",
    "Some children I consider are most unattractive.",
    "Well I agree theyre not brought up very well nowadays.",
    "Everything seems left to the school and of course they\nlead very permissive lives.",
    "Have their own choice of friends and  er  oh really Monsieur Poirot.",
    "Was she a nice child or not a nice child said Poirot insistently.",
    "Mrs Drake looked at him and registered censure.",
    "You must realise Monsieur Poirot that the poor child is dead \nDead or alive it matters.",
    "Perhaps if she was a nice child nobody would have wanted to kill her but if she was not a\nnice child somebody might have wanted to kill her and did so \nWell I suppose  Surely it isnt a question of niceness is it\nIt could be.",
    "I also understand that she claimed to have seen a murder committed.",
    "Oh that said Mrs Drake contemptuously.",
    "You did not take that statement seriously\nWell of course I didnt.",
    "It was a very silly thing to say.",
    "How did she come to say it\nWell I think really they were all rather excited about Mrs Oliver being here.",
    "You are a very famous person you\nmust remember dear said Mrs Drake addressing Mrs Oliver.",
    "The word dear seemed included in her speech without any acompanying enthusiasm.",
    "I dont suppose the subject would ever have arisen otherwise but the children were excited by meeting a famous\nauthoress \nSo Joyce said that she had seen a murder committed said Poirot thoughtfully.",
    "Yes she said something of the kind.",
    "I wasnt really listening.",
    "But you do remember that she said it\nOh yes she said it.",
    "But I didnt believe it said Mrs Drake.",
    "Her sister hushed her up at once very properly.",
    "And she was annoyed about that was she\nYes she went on saying that it was true.",
    "In fact she boasted about it.",
    "When you put it that way yes.",
    "It might have been true I suppose said Poirot.",
    "Nonsense I dont believe it for one minute said Mrs Drake.",
    "Its the sort of stupid thing Joyce would say.",
    "She was a stupid girl\nWell she was the kind I think who liked to show off said Mrs Drake.",
    "You know she always wanted to have\nseen more or done more than other girls.",
    "Not a very lovable character said Poirot.",
    "No indeed said Mrs Drake.",
    "Really the kind that you have to be shutting up all the time.",
    "What did the other children who were there have to say about it Were they impressed\nThey laughed at her said Mrs Drake.",
    "So of course that made her worse.",
    "Well said Poirot as he rose I am glad to have your positive assurance on that point.",
    "He bowed politely over her\nhand.",
    "Goodbye Madame thank you so much for allowing me to view the scene of this very unpleasant\noccurrence.",
    "I hope it has not recalled unpleasant memories too definitely to you.",
    "Of course said Mrs Drake it is very painful to recall anything of this kind.",
    "I had so hoped our little party would\ngo off well.",
    "Indeed it was going off well and everyone seemed to be enjoying it so much till this terrible thing\nhappened.",
    "However the only thing one can do is to try and forget it all.",
    "Of course its very unfortunate that Joyce\nshould have made this silly remark about seeing a murder.",
    "Have you ever had a murder in Woodleigh Common\nNot that I can remember said Mrs Drake firmly.",
    "In this age of increased crime that we live in said Poirot that really seems somewhat unusual does it not\nWell I think there was a lorry driver who killed a pal of his  something like that  and a little girl whom they found\nburied in a gravel pit about fifteen miles from here but that was years ago.",
    "They were both rather sordid and\nuninteresting crimes.",
    "Mainly the result of drink I think.",
    "In fact the kind of murder unlikely to have been witnessed by a girl of twelve or thirteen.",
    "Most unlikely I should say.",
    "And I can assure you Monsieur Poirot this statement that the girl made was solely in\norder to impress friends and perhaps interest a famous character.",
    "She looked rather coldly across at Mrs Oliver.",
    "In fact said Mrs Oliver its all my fault for being at the party I suppose.",
    "Oh of course not my dear of course I didnt mean it that way.",
    "Poirot sighed as he departed from the house with\nMrs Oliver by his side.",
    "A very unsuitable place for a murder he said as they walked down the path to the gate.",
    "No atmosphere no\nhaunting sense of tragedy no character worth murdering though I couldnt help thinking that just occasionally\nsomeone might feel like murdering Mrs Drake.",
    "I know what you mean.",
    "She can be intensely irritating sometimes.",
    "So pleased with herself and so complacent.",
    "What is her husband like\nOh shes a widow.",
    "Her husband died a year or two ago.",
    "He got polio and had been a cripple for years.",
    "He was a\nbanker originally I think.",
    "He was very keen on games and sport and hated having to give all that up and be an\ninvalid.",
    "Yes indeed.",
    "He reverted to the subject of the child Joyce.",
    "Just tell me this.",
    "Did anyone who was listening take\nthis assertion of the child Joyce about murder seriously\nI dont know.",
    "I shouldnt have thought anyone did.",
    "The other children for instance\nWell I was thinking really of them.",
    "No I dont think they believed what Joyce was saying.",
    "They thought she was\nmaking up things.",
    "Did you think that too\nWell I did really said Mrs Oliver.",
    "Of course she added Mrs Drake would like to believe that the murder never really happened but she cant very\nwell go as far as that can she\nI understand that this may be painful for her.",
    "I suppose it is in a way said Mrs Oliver but I think that by now you know she is actually getting quite pleased\nto talk about it.",
    "I dont think she likes to have to bottle it up all the time.",
    "Do you like her asked Poirot.",
    "Do you think shes a nice woman\nYou do ask the most difficult questions.",
    "Embarrassing ones said Mrs Oliver.",
    "It seems the only thing you are interested in is whether people are nice or not.",
    "Rowena Drake is the bossy type likes running things and people.",
    "She runs this whole place more or less I should think.",
    "But runs it very efficiently.",
    "It\ndepends if you like bossy women.",
    "I dont much \nWhat about Joyces mother whom we are on our way to see\nShes quite a nice woman.",
    "Rather stupid I should think.",
    "Im sorry for her.",
    "Its pretty awful to have your daughter\nmurdered isnt it And everyone here thinks it was a sex crime which makes it worse.",
    "But there was no evidence of sexual assault or so I understand\nNo but people like to think these things happen.",
    "It makes it more exciting.",
    "You know what people are like.",
    "One thinks one does  but sometimes  well  we do not really know at all.",
    "Wouldnt it be better if my friend Judith Butler was to take you to see Mrs Reynolds She knows her quite well and\nIm a stranger to her.",
    "We will do as planned.",
    "The Computer Programme will go on murmured Mrs Oliver rebelliously.",
    "Chapter 7\nMrs Reynolds was a complete contrast to Mrs Drake.",
    "There was no air of poised competence about her nor indeed\nwas there ever likely to be.",
    "She was wearing conventional black had a moist handkerchief clasped in her hand and\nwas clearly prepared to dissolve into tears at any moment.",
    "Its very kind of you Im sure she said to Mrs Oliver to bring a friend of yours down here to help us.",
    "She put a\ndamp hand into Poirots and looked at him doubtfully.",
    "And if he can help in any way Im sure Ill be very grateful\nthough I dont see what anyone can do.",
    "Nothing will bring her back poor child.",
    "Its awful to think of.",
    "How anyone\ncould deliberately kill anyone of that age.",
    "If she had only cried out  though I suppose he rammed her head\nunderwater straight away and held it there.",
    "Oh I cant bear to think of it.",
    "I really cant.",
    "Indeed Madame I do not want to distress you.",
    "Please do not think of it.",
    "I only want to ask you a few questions that\nmight help  help that is to find your daughters murderer.",
    "Youve no idea yourself I suppose who it can possibly\nbe\nHow could I have any idea I shouldnt have thought there was anyone anyone living here I mean.",
    "This is such a\nnice place.",
    "And the people living here are such nice people.",
    "I suppose it was just someone  some awful man who\ncame in through one of the windows.",
    "Perhaps hed taken drugs or something.",
    "He saw the light and that it was a\nparty so he gate crashed \nYou are quite sure that the assailant was male\nOh it must have been.",
    "Mrs Reynolds sounded shocked.",
    "Im sure it was.",
    "It couldnt have been a woman could it\nA woman might have been strong enough.",
    "Well I suppose in a way I know what you mean.",
    "You mean women are much more athletic nowadays and all that.",
    "But they wouldnt do a thing like this Im sure.",
    "Joyce was only a child  thirteen years old.",
    "I dont want to distress you by staying here too long Madame or to ask you difficult questions.",
    "That already I am\nsure the police are doing elsewhere and I dont want to upset you by dwelling on painful facts.",
    "It was just\nconcerning a remark that your daughter made at the party.",
    "You were not there yourself I think\nWell no I wasnt.",
    "I havent been very well lately and childrens parties can be very tiring.",
    "I drove them there and\nthen later I came back to fetch them.",
    "The three children went together you know.",
    "Ann thats the older one she is\nsixteen and Leopold who is nearly eleven.",
    "What was it Joyce said that you wanted to know about\nMrs Oliver who was there will tell you what your daughters words were exactly.",
    "She said I believe that she had\nonce seen a murder committed.",
    "Joyce Oh she couldnt have said a thing like that.",
    "What murder could she possibly have seen committed\nWell everyone seems to think it was rather unlikely said Poirot.",
    "I just wondered if you thought it likely.",
    "Did she\never speak to you about such a thing\nSeeing a murder Joyce\nYou must remember said Poirot that the term murder might have been used by someone of Joyces age in a\nrather loose way.",
    "It might have been just a question of somebody being run over by a car or of children fighting\ntogether perhaps and one pushing another into a stream or over a bridge.",
    "Something that was not meant seriously\nbut which had an unfortunate result.",
    "Well I cant think of anything like that happening here that Joyce could have seen and she certainly never said\nanything about it to me.",
    "She must have been joking.",
    "She was very positive said Mrs Oliver.",
    "She kept on saying that it was true and that shed seen it.",
    "Did anyone believe her asked Mrs Reynolds.",
    "I dont know said Poirot.",
    "I dont think they did said Mrs Oliver or perhaps they didnt want to  er\n\n\f well encourage her by saying they believed it.",
    "They were inclined to jeer at her and say she was making it all up said Poirot less kindhearted than Mrs Oliver.",
    "Well that wasnt very nice of them said Mrs Reynolds.",
    "As though Joyce would tell a lot of lies about things like\nthat.",
    "She looked flushed and indignant.",
    "I know.",
    "It seems unlikely said Poirot.",
    "It was more possible was it not that she might have made a mistake that\nshe might have seen something she did think could have been described as a murder.",
    "Some accident perhaps.",
    "Shed have said something about it to me if so wouldnt she said Mrs Reynolds still indignant.",
    "One would think so said Poirot.",
    "She did not say so at any time in the past\nYou might have forgotten.",
    "Especially if it wasnt really important.",
    "When do you mean\nWe dont know said Poirot.",
    "That is one of the difficulties.",
    "It might have been three weeks ago  or three years.",
    "She said she had been quite young at the time.",
    "What does a thirteenyearold consider quite young There was no\nsensational happening round here that you can recall\nOh I dont think so.",
    "I mean you do hear of things.",
    "Or read about them in the papers.",
    "You know I mean women\nbeing attacked or a girl and her young man or things like that.",
    "But nothing important that I can remember nothing\nthat Joyce took an interest in or anything of that kind.",
    "But if Joyce said positively she saw a murder would you think she really thought so\nShe wouldnt say so unless she really did think so would she said Mrs Reynolds.",
    "I think she must have got\nsomething mixed up really.",
    "Yes it seems possible.",
    "I wonder he asked if I might speak to your two children who were also at the party\nWell of course though I dont know what you can expect them to tell you.",
    "Anns doing her work for her A levels\nupstairs and Leopolds in the garden assembling a model aeroplane.",
    "Leopold was a solid pudgy faced boy entirely absorbed it seemed in mechanical construction.",
    "It was some few\nmoments before he could pay attention to the questions he was being asked.",
    "You were there werent you Leopold\nYou heard what your sister said.",
    "What did she say\nOh you mean about the murder He seemed bored.",
    "Yes thats what I mean said Poirot.",
    "She said she saw a murder once.",
    "Did she really see such a thing\nNo of course she didnt said Leopold.",
    "It was just like Joyce that.",
    "What do you mean\nIt was just like her showing off said Leopold winding round a piece of wire and breathing forceful through his\nnose as he concentrated.",
    "She was an awfully stupid sort of girl he said.",
    "Shed say anything you know for people to sit up and take\nnotice.",
    "Do you really think she invented the whole thing Leopold shifted his gaze to Mrs Oliver.",
    "I expect she wanted to impress you all he said.",
    "You write detective stories dont you I think she was just putting\nit on so that you should take more notice of her than you did of the others.",
    "That would also be rather like her would it said Poirot.",
    "Oh shed say anything said Leopold.",
    "I bet nobody believed her though.",
    "Were you listening Do you think anyone believed it\nWell I heard her say it but I didnt really listen.",
    "Beatrice laughed at her and so did Cathie.",
    "They said thats a tall\nstory or something.",
    "There seemed little more to be got out of Leopold.",
    "They went upstairs to where Ann looking\nrather more than her sixteen years was bending over a table with various study books spread round her.",
    "Yes I was at the party she said.",
    "You heard your sister say something about having seen a murder\nOh yes I heard her.",
    "I didnt take any notice though.",
    "You didnt think it was true\nOf course it wasnt true.",
    "There havent been any murders here for ages.",
    "I dont think theres been a proper murder for\nyears.",
    "Then why do you think she said so\nOh she likes showing off.",
    "I mean she used to like showing off.",
    "She had a wonderful story once about having\ntravelled to India.",
    "My uncle had been on a voyage there and she pretended she went with him.",
    "Lots of girls at school\nactually believed her.",
    "So you dont remember any  what you call murders  taking place here in the last three or four years\nNo only the usual kind said Ann.",
    "I mean the ones you read every day in the newspaper.",
    "And they werent\nactually here in Woodleigh Common.",
    "They were mostly in Medchester I think.",
    "Who do you think killed your sister Ann You must have known her friends you would know any people who\ndidnt like her.",
    "I cant imagine whod want to kill her.",
    "I suppose someone who was just batty.",
    "Nobody else would would they\nThere was no one who had  quarrelled with her or who did not get on with her\nYou mean did she have an enemy I think thats silly.",
    "People dont have enemies really.",
    "There are just people you\ndont like.",
    "As they departed from the room Ann said I dont want to be nasty about Joyce because shes dead and\nit wouldnt be kind but she really was the most awful liar you know.",
    "I mean Im sorry to say things about my sister\nbut its quite true.",
    "Are we making any progress said Mrs Oliver as they left the house.",
    "None whatever said Hercule Poirot.",
    "That is interesting he said thoughtfully.",
    "Mrs Oliver looked as though she didnt agree with him.",
    "Chapter 8\nIt was six oclock at Pine Crest.",
    "Hercule Poirot put a piece of sausage into his mouth and followed it up with a sip of\ntea.",
    "The tea was strong and to Poirot singularly unpalatable.",
    "The sausage on the other hand was delicious.",
    "Cooked\nto perfection.",
    "He looked with appreciation across the table to where Mrs McKay presided over the large brown\nteapot.",
    "Elspeth McKay was as unlike her brother Superintendent Spence as she could be in every way.",
    "Where he was\nbroad she was angular.",
    "Her sharp thin face looked out on the world with shrewd appraisal.",
    "She was thin as a thread\nyet there was a certain likeness between them.",
    "Mainly the eyes and the strongly marked line of the jaw.",
    "Either of them Poirot thought could be relied upon for\njudgment and good sense.",
    "They would express themselves differently but that was all.",
    "Superintendent Spence would express himself slowly and carefully as the result of due thought and deliberation.",
    "Mrs\nMcKay would pounce quick and sharp like a cat upon a mouse.",
    "A lot depends said Poirot upon the character of this child Joyce Reynolds.",
    "That is what puzzles me most.",
    "He looked inquiringly at Spence.",
    "You cant go by me said Spence Ive not lived here long enough.",
    "Better ask Elspeth.",
    "Poirot looked across the table his eyebrows raised inquiringly.",
    "Mrs McKay was sharp as usual in response.",
    "Id say she was a proper little liar she said.",
    "Not a girl whom youd trust and believe what she said Elspeth shook her head decidedly.",
    "No indeed.",
    "Tell a tall\ntale she would and tell it well mind you.",
    "But Id never believe her.",
    "Tell it with the object of showing off\nThats right.",
    "They told you the Indian story didnt they Theres many as believed that you know.",
    "Been away for\nthe holidays the family had.",
    "Gone abroad somewhere.",
    "I dont know if it was her father and mother or her uncle and\naunt but they went to India and she came back from those holidays with tall tales of how shed been taken there with\nthem.",
    "Made a good story of it she did.",
    "A Maharajah and a tiger shoot and elephants  ah it was fine hearing and a\nlot of those around her here believed it.",
    "But I said straight along shes telling more than ever happened.",
    "Could be I\nthought at first she was just exaggerating.",
    "But the story got added to every time.",
    "There were more tigers if you\nknow what I mean.",
    "Far more tigers than could possibly happen.",
    "And elephants too for that matter.",
    "Id known her\nbefore too telling tall stories.",
    "Always to get attention\nAye youre right there.",
    "She was a great one for getting attention.",
    "Because a child told a tall story about a travel trip she never took said Superintendent Spence you cant say that\nevery tall tale she told was a lie.",
    "It might not be said Elspeth but Id say the likelihood was that it usually would be.",
    "So you think that if Joyce Reynolds came out with a tale that shed seen a murder committed youd say she was\nprobably lying and you wouldnt believe the story was true\nThats what Id think said Mrs McKay.",
    "You might be wrong said her brother.",
    "Yes said Mrs McKay.",
    "Anyone may be wrong.",
    "Its like the old story of the boy who cried Wolf wolf and he\ncried it once too often when it was a real wolf and nobody believed him and so the wolf got him.",
    "So youd sum it up \nId still say the probabilities are that she wasnt speaking the truth.",
    "But Im a fair woman.",
    "She may have been.",
    "She\nmay have seen something.",
    "Not quite so much as she said she saw but something.",
    "And so she got herself killed said Superintendent Spence.",
    "Youve got to mind that Elspeth.",
    "She got herself\n\n\fkilled.",
    "Thats true enough said Mrs McKay.",
    "And thats why Im saying maybe Ive misjudged her.",
    "And if so Im sorry.",
    "But ask anyone who knew her and theyll tell you that lies came natural to her.",
    "It was a party she was at remember\nand she was excited.",
    "Shed want to make an effect.",
    "Indeed they didnt believe her said Poirot.",
    "Elspeth McKay shook her head doubtfully.",
    "Who could she have seen murdered asked Poirot.",
    "He looked from brother to sister.",
    "Nobody said Mrs McKay with decision.",
    "There must have been deaths here say over the last three years.",
    "Oh that naturally said Spence.",
    "Just the usual old folks or invalids or what youd expect or maybe a hitandrun\nmotorist \nNo unusual or unexpected deaths\nWell  Elspeth hesitated.",
    "I mean  Spence took over.",
    "Ive jotted a few names down here.",
    "He pushed the paper over to Poirot.",
    "Save you a\nbit of trouble asking questions around.",
    "Are these suggested victims\nHardly as much as that.",
    "Say within the range of possibility.",
    "Poirot read aloud.",
    "Mrs LlewellynSmythe.",
    "Charlotte Benfield.",
    "Janet White.",
    "Lesley Ferrier  He broke off looked across the table and\nrepeated the first name.",
    "Mrs LlewellynSmythe.",
    "Could be said Mrs McKay.",
    "Yes you might have something there.",
    "She added a word that sounded like\nopera.",
    "Opera Poirot looked puzzled.",
    "He had heard of no opera.",
    "Went off one night she did said Elspeth was never heard of again.",
    "Mrs LlewellynSmythe\nNo no.",
    "The opera girl.",
    "She could have put something in the medicine easily enough.",
    "And she came into all the\nmoney didnt she  or so she thought at the time\nPoirot looked at Spence for enlightenment.",
    "And never been heard of since said Mrs McKay.",
    "These foreign girls are all the same.",
    "The significance of the word opera came to Poirot.",
    "An au pair girl he said.",
    "Thats right.",
    "Lived with the old lady and a week or two after the old lady died the au pair girl just disappeared.",
    "Went off with some man Id say said Spence.",
    "Well nobody knew of him if so said Elspeth.",
    "And theres usually plenty of talk about here.",
    "Usually know just\nwhos going with who.",
    "Did anybody think there had been anything wrong about Mrs LlewellynSmythes death asked Poirot.",
    "No.",
    "Shed got heart trouble.",
    "Doctor attended her regularly.",
    "But you headed your list of possible victims with her my friend\nWell she was a rich woman a very rich woman.",
    "Her death was not unexpected but it was sudden.",
    "Id say offhand\nthat Dr Ferguson was surprised even if only slightly surprised.",
    "I think he expected her to live longer.",
    "But doctors do\nhave these surprises.",
    "She wasnt one to do as the doctor ordered.",
    "Shed been told not to overdo things but she did\nexactly as she liked.",
    "For one thing she was a passionate gardener and that doesnt do heart cases any good.",
    "Elspeth\nMcKay took up the tale.",
    "She came here when her health failed.",
    "She was living abroad before.",
    "She came here to be\nnear her nephew and niece Mr and Mrs Drake and she bought the Quarry House.",
    "A big Victorian house which\nincluded a disused quarry which attracted her as having possibilities.",
    "She spent thousands of pounds on turning that\nquarry into a sunk garden or whatever they call the thing.",
    "Had a landscape gardener down from Wisley or one of\nthese places to design it.",
    "Oh I can tell you its something to look at.",
    "I shall go and look at it said Poirot.",
    "Who knows it might give me ideas.",
    "Yes I would go if I were you.",
    "Its well worth seeing.",
    "And she was rich you say said Poirot.",
    "Widow of a big shipbuilder.",
    "She had packets of money.",
    "Her death was not unexpected because she had a heart condition but it was sudden said Spence.",
    "No doubts arose\nthat it was due to anything but natural causes.",
    "Cardiac failure or whatever the longer name is that doctors use.",
    "Coronary something.",
    "No question of an inquest ever arose\nSpence shook his head.",
    "It has happened before said Poirot.",
    "An elderly woman told to be careful not to run up and down stairs not to do\nany intensive gardening and so on and so on.",
    "But if you get an energetic woman whos been an enthusiastic\ngardener all her life and done as she liked in most ways then she doesnt always treat these recommendations with\ndue respect.",
    "Thats true enough.",
    "Mrs LlewellynSmythe made a wonderful thing of the quarry  or rather the landscape artist\ndid.",
    "Three or four years they worked at it he and his employer.",
    "Shed seen some garden in Ireland I think it was\nwhen she went on a National Trust tour visiting gardens.",
    "With that in her mind they fairly transformed the place.",
    "Oh\nyes it has to be seen to be believed.",
    "Here is a natural death then said Poirot certified as such by the local doctor.",
    "Is that the same doctor who is here\nnow And whom I am shortly going to see\nDr Ferguson  yes.",
    "Hes a man of about sixty good at his job and well liked here.",
    "But you suspect that her death might have been murder For any other reasons than those that youve already given\nme\nThe opera girl for one thing said Elspeth.",
    "Why\nWell she must have forged the Will.",
    "Who forged the Will if she didnt\n\n\fYou must have more to tell me said Poirot.",
    "What is all this about a forged Will\nWell there was a bit of fuss when it came to probating or whatever you call it the old ladys Will.",
    "Was it a new Will\nIt was what they call something that sounds like fish  a cod  a codicil.",
    "Elspeth looked at Poirot who nodded.",
    "Shed made Wills before said Spence.",
    "All much the same.",
    "Bequests to charities legacies to old servants but the bulk of her fortune always went to her\nnephew and his wife who were her near relatives.",
    "And this particular codicil\nLeft everything to the opera girl said Elspeth because of her devoted care and kindness.",
    "Something like that.",
    "Tell me then more about the au pair girl.",
    "She came from some country in the middle of Europe.",
    "Some long name.",
    "How long had she been with the old lady\nJust over a year.",
    "You call her the old lady always.",
    "How old was she\nWell in the sixties.",
    "Sixtyfive or six say.",
    "That is not so very old said Poirot feelingly.",
    "Made several Wills she had by all accounts said Elspeth.",
    "As Bert has told you all of them much the same.",
    "Leaving money to one or two charities and then perhaps shed change the charities and some different souvenirs to\nold servants and all that.",
    "But the bulk of the money always went to her nephew and his wife and I think some other\nold cousin who was dead though by the time she died.",
    "She left the bungalow shed built to the landscape man for\nhim to live in as long as he liked and some kind of income for which he was to keep up the quarry garden and let it\nbe walked in by the public.",
    "Something like that.",
    "I suppose the family claimed that the balance of her mind had been disturbed that there had been undue influence\nI think probably it might have come to that said Spence.",
    "But the lawyers as I say got on to the forgery sharply.",
    "It was not a very convincing forgery apparently.",
    "They spotted it almost at once.",
    "Things came to light to show that the opera girl could have done it quite easily said Elspeth.",
    "You see she wrote a great many of Mrs LlewellynSmythes letters for her and it seems Mrs LlewellynSmythe had\na great dislike of typed letters being sent to friends or anything like that.",
    "If it wasnt a business letter shed always\nsay\nwrite it in handwriting and make it as much like mine as you can and sign it with my name.",
    "Mrs Minden the\ncleaning woman heard her say that one day and I suppose the girl got used to doing it and copying her employers\nhandwriting and then it came to her suddenly that she could do this and get away with it.",
    "And thats how it all came\nabout.",
    "But as I say the lawyers were too sharp and spotted it.",
    "Mrs LlewellynSmythes own lawyers\nYes.",
    "Fullerton Harrison and Leadbetter.",
    "Very respectable firm in Medchester.",
    "Theyd always done all her legal\nbusiness for her.",
    "Anyway they got experts on to it and questions were asked and the girl was asked questions and\ngot the wind up.",
    "Just walked out one day leaving half her things behind her.",
    "They were preparing to take\n\n\fproceedings against her but she didnt wait for that.",
    "She just got out.",
    "Its not so difficult really to get out of this\ncountry if you do it in time.",
    "Why you can go on day trips on the Continent without a passport and if youve got a\nlittle arrangement with someone on the other side things can be arranged long before there is any real hue and cry.",
    "Shes probably gone back to her own country or changed her name or gone to friends.",
    "But everyone thought that Mrs LlewellynSmythe died a natural death asked Poirot.",
    "Yes I dont think there was ever any question of that.",
    "I only say its possible because as I say these things have\nhappened before where the doctor has no suspicion.",
    "Supposing that girl Joyce had heard something had heard the au\npair girl giving medicines to Mrs LlewellynSmythe and the old lady saying\nthis medicine tastes different to the usual one.",
    "Or this has got a bitter taste or its peculiar.",
    "Anyone would think youd been there listening to things yourself Elspeth said Superintendent Spence.",
    "This is all\nyour imagination.",
    "When did she die said Poirot.",
    "Morning evening indoors out of doors at home or away from home\nOh at home.",
    "Shed come up from doing things in the garden one day breathing rather heavily.",
    "She said she was\nvery tired and she went to lie down on her bed.",
    "And to put it in one sentence she never woke up.",
    "Which is all very\nnatural it seems medically speaking.",
    "Poirot took out a little notebook.",
    "The page was already headed Victims.",
    "Under he wrote.",
    "No.",
    "1 suggested Mrs LlewellynSmythe.",
    "On the next pages of his book he wrote down the other names that Spence had given him.",

    "Two young\nmen came under suspicion.",
    "Both had walked out with her from time to time.",
    "No evidence.",
    "They assisted the police in their inquiries asked Poirot.",
    "As you say.",
    "Its the usual phrase.",
    "They didnt assist much.",
    "They were frightened.",
    "Told a few lies contradicted\nthemselves.",
    "They didnt carry conviction as likely murderers.",
    "But either of them might have been.",
    "What were they like\nPeter Gordon twentyone.",
    "Unemployed.",
    "Had had one or two jobs but never kept them.",
    "Lazy.",
    "Quite goodlooking.",
    "Had been on probation once or twice for minor pilferings things of that kind.",
    "No record before of violence.",

    "Twenty.",
    "Stammered.",
    "Shy.",
    "Neurotic.",
    "Wanted to be a teacher but couldnt make the grade.",

    "He had a job in a stationers.",
    "Nothing criminal known against him but a possibility psychologically so it seems.",
    "The\ngirl played him up a good deal.",
    "Jealousy a possible motive but no evidence that we could prosecute on.",
    "Both of\nthem had alibis.",
    "Hudds was his mothers.",
    "She would have sworn to kingdom come that he was indoors with her all\nthat evening and nobody can say he wasnt or had seen him elsewhere or in the neighbourhood of the murder.",
    "Young Gordon was given an alibi by some of his less reputable friends.",
    "Not worth much but you couldnt disprove\nit.",
    "This happened when\nEighteen months ago.",
    "And where\nIn a footpath in a field not far from Woodleigh Common.",
    "Three quarters of a mile said Elspeth.",
    "Near Joyces house  the Reynolds house\nNo it was on the other side of the village.",
    "It seems unlikely to have been the murder Joyce was talking about said Poirot thoughtfully.",
    "If you see a girl\nbeing bashed on the head by a young man youd be likely to think of murder straight away.",
    "Not to wait for a year\nbefore you began to think it was murder.",
    "Poirot read another name.",
    "Lesley Ferrier.",
    "Spence spoke again.",
    "Lawyers clerk twentyeight employed by Messrs. Fullerton Harrison and Leadbetter of Market Street\nMedchester.",
    "Those were Mrs LlewellynSmythes solicitors I think you said.",
    "Yes.",
    "Same ones.",
    "And what happened to Lesley Ferrier\nHe was stabbed in the back.",
    "Not far from the Green Swan Pub.",
    "He was said to have been having an affair with the\nwife of the landlord Harry Griffin.",
    "Handsome piece she was indeed still is.",

    "Five or six years older than he was but she liked them young.",
    "The weapon\nThe knife wasnt found.",
    "Les was said to have broken with her and taken up with some other girl but what girl was\nnever satisfactorily discovered.",
    "Ah.",
    "And who was suspected in this case The landlord or the wife\nQuite right said Spence.",
    "Might have been either.",
    "The wife seemed the more likely.",
    "She was half gypsy and a\ntemperamental piece.",
    "But there were other possibilities.",
    "Our Lesley hadnt led a blameless life.",
    "Got into trouble in\nhis early twenties falsifying his accounts somewhere.",
    "With a spot of forgery.",
    "Was said to have come from a broken\nhome and all the rest of it.",
    "Employers spoke up for him.",
    "He got a short sentence and was taken on by Fullerton\nHarrison and Leadbetter when he came out of prison.",
    "And after that hed gone straight\nWell nothing proved.",
    "He appeared to do so as far as his employers were concerned but he had been mixed up in a\nfew questionable transactions with his friends.",
    "Hes what you might call a wrong un but a careful one.",
    "So the alternative was\nThat he might have been stabbed by one of his less reputable associates.",
    "When youre in with a nasty crowd youve\ngot it coming to you with a knife if you let them down.",
    "Anything else\nWell he had a good lot of money in his bank account.",
    "Paid in in cash it had been.",
    "Nothing to show where it came\nfrom.",
    "That was suspicious in itself.",
    "Possibly pinched from Fullerton Harrison and Leadbetter suggested Poirot.",
    "They say not.",
    "They had a chartered accountant to work on it and look into things.",
    "And the police had no idea where else it might have come from\nNo.",
    "Again said Poirot not Joyces murder I should think.",
    "He read the last name Janet White.",
    "Found strangled on a footpath which was a short cut from the schoolhouse to her home.",
    "She shared a flat there with\nanother teacher Nora Ambrose.",
    "According to Nora Ambrose Janet White had occasionally spoken of being nervous\nabout some man with whom shed broken off relations a year ago but who had frequently sent her threatening\nletters.",
    "Nothing was ever found out about this man.",
    "Nora Ambrose didnt know his name didnt know exactly where\nhe lived.",
    "Aha said Poirot I like this better.",
    "He made a good thick black tick against Janet Whites name.",
    "For what reason asked Spence.",
    "It is a more likely murder for a girl of Joyces age to have witnessed.",
    "She could have recognised the victim a\nschoolteacher whom she knew and who perhaps taught her.",
    "Possibly she did not know the attacker.",
    "She might have\nseen a struggle heard a quarrel between a girl whom she knew and a strange man.",
    "But thought no more of it than\nthat at that time.",
    "When was Janet White killed\nTwo and a half years ago.",
    "That again said Poirot is about the right time.",
    "Both for not realising that the man she may have seen with his\nhands round Janet Whites neck was not merely necking her but might have been killing her.",
    "But then as she grew\nmore mature the proper explanation came to her.",
    "He looked at Elspeth.",
    "You agree with my reasoning\nI see what you mean said Elspeth.",
    "But arent you going at all this the wrong way round Looking for a victim of\na past murder instead of looking for a man who killed a child here in Woodleigh Common not more than three days\nago\nWe go from the past to the future said Poirot.",
    "We arrive shall we say from two and a half years ago to three\ndays ago.",
    "And therefore we have to consider what you no doubt have already considered  who was there in\nWoodleigh Common amongst the people who were at the party who might have been connected with an older\ncrime\nOne can narrow it down a bit more than that now said Spence.",
    "That is if we are right in accepting your\nassumption that Joyce was killed because of what she claimed earlier in the day about seeing murder committed.",
    "She\nsaid those words during the time the preparations for the party were going on.",
    "Mind you we may be wrong in\nbelieving that that was the motive for killing but I dont think we are wrong.",
    "So let us say she claimed to have seen\nmurder and someone who was present during the preparations for the party that afternoon could have heard her and\nacted as soon as possible.",
    "Who was present said Poirot.",
    "You know I presume.",
    "Yes I have the list for you here.",
    "You have checked it carefully\nYes Ive checked and rechecked but its been quite a job.",
    "Here are the eighteen names.",
    "List of people present during preparation for Halloween Party\nMrs Drake owner of house\nMrs Butler\nMrs Oliver\nMiss Whittaker schoolteacher\nRev.",
    "Charles Cotterell Vicar\nSimon Lampton Curate\nMiss Lee Dr Fergusons dispenser\nAnn Reynolds\nJoyce Reynolds\nLeopold Reynolds\nNicholas Ransom\nDesmond Holland\nBeatrice Ardley\nCathie Grant\nDiana Brent\nMrs Garlton household help\nMrs Minden cleaning woman\nMrs Goodbody helper\nYou are sure these are all\nNo said Spence.",
    "Im not sure.",
    "I cant really be sure.",
    "Nobody can.",
    "You see odd people brought things.",
    "Somebody\nbrought some coloured light bulbs.",
    "Somebody else supplied some mirrors.",
    "There were some extra plates.",
    "Someone\nlent a plastic pail.",
    "People brought things exchanged a word or two and went away again.",
    "They didnt remain to help.",
    "Therefore such a person could have been overlooked and not remembered as being present.",
    "But that somebody even\nif they had only just deposited a bucket in the hall could have overheard what Joyce was saying in the sittingroom.",
    "She was shouting you know.",
    "We cant really limit it to this list but its the best we can do.",
    "Here you are.",
    "Take a look\nat it.",
    "Ive made a brief descriptive note against the names.",
    "I thank you.",
    "Just one question.",
    "You must have interrogated some of these people those for instance who were also\nat the party.",
    "Did anyone anyone at all mention what Joyce had said about seeing a murder\nI think not.",
    "There is no record of it officially.",
    "The first I heard of it is what you told me.",
    "Interesting said Poirot.",
    "One might also say remarkable.",
    "Obviously no one took it seriously said Spence.",
    "Poirot nodded thoughtfully.",
    "I must go now to keep my appointment with Dr Ferguson after his surgery he said.",
    "He folded up Spences list and put it in his pocket.",
    "Chapter 9\nDr Ferguson was a man of sixty of Scottish extraction with a brusque manner.",
    "He looked Poirot up and down with\nshrewd eyes under bristling eyebrows and said\nWell whats all this about Sit down.",
    "Mind that chair leg.",
    "The castors loose.",
    "I should perhaps explain said Poirot.",
    "You neednt explain said Dr Ferguson.",
    "Everybody knows everything in a place like this.",
    "That authoress woman\nbrought you down here as Gods greatest detective to puzzle police officers.",
    "Thats more or less right isnt it\nIn part said Poirot.",
    "I came here to visit an old friend exSuperintendent Spence who lives with his sister here.",
    "Spence Hm.",
    "Good type Spence.",
    "Bulldog breed.",
    "Good honest police officer of the old type.",
    "No graft.",
    "No violence.",
    "Not stupid either.",
    "Straight as a die.",
    "You appraise him correctly.",
    "Well said Ferguson what did you tell him and what did he tell you\nBoth he and Inspector Raglan have been exceedingly kind to me.",
    "I hope you will likewise.",
    "Ive nothing to be kind about said Ferguson.",
    "I dont know what happened.",
    "Child gets her head shoved in a bucket\nand is drowned in the middle of a party.",
    "Nasty business.",
    "Mind you doing in a child isnt anything to be startled\nabout nowadays.",
    "Ive been called out to look at too many murdered children in the last seven to ten years  far too\nmany.",
    "A lot of people who ought to be under mental restraint arent under mental restraint.",
    "No room in the asylums.",
    "They go about nicely spoken nicely got up and looking like everybody else looking for somebody they can do in.",
    "And enjoy themselves.",
    "Dont usually do it at a party though.",
    "Too much chance of getting caught I suppose but\nnovelty appeals even to a mentally disturbed killer.",
    "Have you any idea who killed her\nDo you really suppose thats a question I can answer just like that Id have to have some evidence wouldnt I Id\nhave to be sure.",
    "You could guess said Poirot.",
    "Anyone can guess.",
    "If Im called in to a case I have to guess whether the chaps going to have measles or whether its\na case of an allergy to shellfish or to feather pillows.",
    "I have to ask questions to find out what theyve been eating or\ndrinking or sleeping on or what other children theyve been meeting.",
    "Whether theyve been in a crowded bus with\nMrs Smiths or Mrs Robinsons children whove all got the measles and a few other things.",
    "Then I advance a\ntentative opinion as to which it is of the various possibilities and that let me tell you is whats called diagnosis.",
    "You\ndont do it in a hurry and you make sure.",
    "Did you know this child\nOf course.",
    "She was one of my patients.",
    "There are two of us here.",
    "Myself and Worrall.",
    "I happen to be the Reynolds\ndoctor.",
    "She was quite a healthy child Joyce.",
    "Had the usual small childish ailments.",
    "Nothing peculiar or out of the\nway.",
    "Ate too much talked too much.",
    "Talking too much hadnt done her any harm.",
    "Eating too much gave her what\n\n\fused to be called in the old days a bilious attack from time to time.",
    "Shed had mumps and chicken pox.",
    "Nothing\nelse.",
    "But she had perhaps talked too much on one occasion as you suggest she might be liable to do.",
    "So thats the tack youre on I heard some rumour of that.",
    "On the lines of\nwhat the butler saw  only tragedy instead of comedy.",
    "Is that it\nIt could form a motive a reason.",
    "Oh yes.",
    "Grant you that.",
    "But there are other reasons.",
    "Mentally disturbed seems the usual answer nowadays.",
    "At any\nrate it does always in the Magistrates\ncourts.",
    "Nobody gained by her death nobody hated her.",
    "But it seems to me with children nowadays you dont need to\nlook for the reason.",
    "The reasons in another place.",
    "The reasons in the killers mind.",
    "His disturbed mind or his evil\nmind or his kinky mind.",
    "Any kind of mind you like to call it.",
    "Im not a psychiatrist.",
    "There are times when I get tired\nof hearing those words Remanded for a psychiatrists report after a lad has broken in somewhere smashed the\nlookingglasses pinched bottles of whisky stolen the silver and knocked an old woman on the head.",
    "Doesnt much\nmatter what it is now.",
    "Remand them for the psychiatrists report.",
    "And who would you favour in this case to remand for a psychiatrists report\nYou mean of those there at the party the other night\nYes.",
    "The murderer would have had to be there wouldnt he Otherwise there wouldnt have been a murder.",
    "Right He\nwas among the guests he was among the helpers or he walked in through the window with malice aforethought.",
    "Probably he knew the fastenings of that house.",
    "Might have been in there before looking round.",
    "Take your man or\nboy.",
    "He wants to kill someone.",
    "Not at all unusual.",
    "Over in Medchester we had a case of that.",
    "Came to light after\nabout six or seven years.",
    "Boy of thirteen.",
    "Wanted to kill someone so he killed a child of nine pinched a car drove it\nseven or eight miles into a copse burned her there went away and as far as we know led a blameless life until he\nwas twentyone or two.",
    "Mind you we have only his word for that he may have gone on doing it.",
    "Probably did.",
    "Found he liked killing people.",
    "Dont suppose hes killed too many or some police force would have been on to him\nbefore now.",
    "But every now and then he felt the urge.",
    "Psychiatrists report.",
    "Committed murder while mentally\ndisturbed.",
    "Im trying to say myself that thats what happened here.",
    "That sort of thing anyway.",
    "Im not a psychiatrist\nmyself thank goodness.",
    "I have a few psychiatrist friends.",
    "Some of them are sensible chaps.",
    "Some of them  well Ill\ngo as far as saying they ought to be remanded for a psychiatrists report themselves.",
    "This chap who killed Joyce\nprobably had nice parents ordinary manners good appearance.",
    "Nobodyd dream anything was wrong with him.",
    "Ever\nhad a bite at a nice red juicy apple and there down by the core something rather nasty rears itself up and wags its\nhead at you Plenty of human beings about like that.",
    "More than there used to be Id say nowadays.",
    "And youve no suspicion of your own\nI cant stick my neck out and diagnose a murderer without some evidence.",
    "Still you admit it must have been someone at the party.",
    "You cannot have a murder without a murderer.",
    "You can easily in some detective stories that are written.",
    "Probably your pet authoress writes them like that.",
    "But in\nthis case I agree.",
    "The murderer must have been there.",
    "A guest a domestic help someone who walked in through the\nwindow.",
    "Easily done if hed studied the catch of the window beforehand.",
    "It might have struck some crazy brain that\nit would be a novel idea and a bit of fun to have a murder at a Halloween party.",
    "Thats all youve got to start off\nwith isnt it Just someone who was at the party.",
    "Under bushy brows a pair of eyes twinkled at Poirot.",
    "I was there myself he said.",
    "Came in late just to see what was doing.",
    "He nodded his head vigorously.",
    "Yes thats the problem isnt it Like a social announcement in the papers\nAmongst those present was A Murderer\nChapter 10\nPoirot looked up at The Elms and approved of it.",
    "He was admitted and taken promptly by what he judged to be a secretary to the headmistresss study.",
    "Miss Emlyn rose from her desk to greet him.",
    "I am delighted to meet you Mr Poirot.",
    "Ive heard about you.",
    "You are too kind said Poirot.",
    "From a very old friend of mine Miss Bulstrode.",
    "Former headmistress of Meadowbank.",
    "You remember Miss\nBulstrode perhaps\nOne would not be likely to forget her.",
    "A great personality.",
    "Yes said Miss Emlyn.",
    "She made Meadowbank the school it is.",
    "She sighed slightly and said It has changed a\nlittle nowadays.",
    "Different aims different methods but it still holds its own as a school of distinction of progress\nand also of tradition.",
    "Ah well we must not live too much in the past.",
    "You have come to see me no doubt about the\ndeath of Joyce Reynolds.",
    "I dont know if you have any particular interest in her case.",
    "Its out of your usual run of\nthings I imagine.",
    "You knew her personally or her family perhaps\nNo said Poirot.",
    "I came at the request of an old friend Mrs Ariadne Oliver who was staying down here and was\npresent at the party.",
    "She writes delightful books said Miss Emlyn.",
    "I have met her once or twice.",
    "Well that makes the whole thing\neasier I think to discuss.",
    "So long as no personal feelings are involved one can go straight ahead.",
    "It was a horrifying\nthing to happen.",
    "If I may say so it was an unlikely thing to happen.",
    "The children involved seem neither old enough\nnor young enough for it to fall into any special class.",
    "A psychological crime is indicated.",
    "Do you agree\nNo said Poirot.",
    "I think it was a murder like most murders committed for a motive possibly a sordid one.",
    "Indeed.",
    "And the reason\nThe reason was a remark made by Joyce not actually at the party I understand but earlier in the day when\npreparations were being made by some of the older children and other helpers.",
    "She announced that she had once\nseen a murder committed.",
    "Was she believed\nOn the whole I think she was not believed.",
    "That seems the most likely response.",
    "Joyce  I speak plainly to you Monsieur Poirot because we do not want\nunnecessary sentiment to cloud mental faculties  she was a rather mediocre child neither stupid nor particularly\nintellectual.",
    "She was quite frankly a compulsive liar.",
    "And by that I do not mean that she was specially deceitful.",
    "She was not trying to avoid retribution or to avoid being found out in some peccadillo.",
    "She boasted.",
    "She boasted of\nthings that had not happened but that would impress her friends who were listening to her.",
    "As a result of course\nthey inclined not to believe the tall stories she told.",
    "You think that she boasted of having seen a murder committed in order to make herself important to intrigue\nsomeone \nYes.",
    "And I would suggest that Ariadne Oliver was doubtless the person whom she wanted to impress...",
    "So you dont think Joyce saw a murder committed at all\nI should doubt it very much.",
    "You are of the opinion that she made the whole thing up\nI would not say that.",
    "She did witness perhaps a car accident or someone perhaps who was hit with a ball on the\ngolf links and injured  something that she could work up into an impressive happening that might just conceivably\npass as an attempted murder.",
    "So the only assumption we can make with any certainty is that there was a murderer present at the Halloween\nparty.",
    "Certainly said Miss Emlyn without turning a grey hair.",
    "Certainly.",
    "That follows on logically does it not\nWould you have any idea who that murderer might be\nThat is certainly a sensible question said Miss Emlyn.",
    "After all the majority of the children at the party were\naged between nine and fifteen and I suppose nearly all of them had been or were pupils at my school.",
    "I ought to\nknow something about them.",
    "Something too about their families and their backgrounds.",
    "I believe that one of your own teachers a year or two ago was strangled by an unknown killer.",
    "You are referring to Janet White About twentyfour years of age.",
    "An emotional girl.",
    "As far as is known she was\nout walking alone.",
    "She may of course have arranged to meet some young man.",
    "She was a girl who was quite\nattractive to men in a modest sort of way.",
    "Her killer has not been discovered.",
    "The police questioned various young\nmen or asked them to assist them in their inquiries as the technique goes but they were not able to find sufficient\nevidence to bring a case against anyone.",
    "An unsatisfactory business from their point of view.",
    "And I may say from\nmine.",
    "You and I have a principle in common.",
    "We do not approve of murder.",
    "Miss Emlyn looked at him for a moment or\ntwo.",
    "Her expression did not change but Poirot had an idea that he was being sized up with a great deal of care.",
    "I like the way you put it she said.",
    "From what you read and hear nowadays it seems that murder under certain\naspects is slowly but surely being made acceptable to a large section of the community.",
    "She was silent for a few minutes and Poirot also did not speak.",
    "She was he thought considering a plan of action.",
    "She rose and touched a bell.",
    "I think she said that you had better talk to Miss Whittaker.",
    "Some five minutes passed after Miss Emlyn had left\nthe room and then the door opened and a woman of about forty entered.",
    "She had russetcoloured hair cut short and\ncame in with a brisk step.",
    "Monsieur Poirot she said.",
    "Can I help you Miss Emlyn seems to think that that might be so.",
    "If Miss Emlyn thinks so then it is almost a certainty that you can.",
    "I would take her word for it.",
    "You know her\nI have only met her this afternoon.",
    "But you have made up your mind quickly about her.",
    "I hope you are going to tell me that I am right.",
    "Elizabeth Whittaker gave a short quick sigh.",
    "Oh yes youre right.",
    "I presume that this is about the death of Joyce Reynolds.",
    "I dont know exactly how you come\ninto it.",
    "Through the police She shook her head slightly in a dissatisfied manner.",
    "No not through the police.",
    "Privately through a friend.",
    "She took a chair pushing it back a little so as to face him.",
    "Yes.",
    "What do you want to know\nI dont think there is any need to tell you.",
    "No need to waste time asking questions that may be of no importance.",
    "Something happened that evening at the party which perhaps it is well that I should know about.",
    "Is that it\nYes.",
    "You were at the party\nI was at the party.",
    "She reflected a minute or two.",
    "It was a very good party.",
    "Well run.",
    "Well arranged.",
    "About thirtyodd people were there that is counting helpers of different kinds.",
    "Children  teenagers  grownups  and a few\ncleaning and domestic helpers in the background.",
    "Did you take part in the arrangements which were made I believe earlier that afternoon or that morning\nThere was nothing really to do.",
    "Mrs Drake was fully competent to deal with all the various preparations with a\nsmall number of people to help her.",
    "It was more domestic preparations that were needed.",
    "I see.",
    "But you came to the party as one of the guests\nThat is right.",
    "And what happened\nThe progress of the party I have no doubt you already know.",
    "You want to know if there is anything I can tell you\nthat I specially noticed or that I thought might have a certain significance I dont want to waste your time unduly\nyou understand.",
    "I am sure you will not waste my time.",
    "Yes Miss Whittaker tell me quite simply.",
    "The various events happened in the way already arranged for.",
    "The last event was what was really more a Christmas\nfestivity or associated with Christmas than it would be with Halloween.",
    "The Snapdragon a burning dish of raisins\nwith brandy poured over them and those round snatch at the raisins  there are squeals of laughter and excitement.",
    "It\nbecame very hot though in the room with the burning dish and I left it and came out in the hall.",
    "It was then as I\nstood there that I saw Mrs Drake coming out of the lavatory on the first floor landing.",
    "She was carrying a large vase\nof mixed autumn leaves and flowers.",
    "She stood at the angle of the staircase pausing for a moment before coming\ndownstairs.",
    "She was looking down over the well of the staircase.",
    "Not in my direction.",
    "She was looking towards the\nother end of the hall where there is a door leading into the library.",
    "It is set just across the hall from the door into the\ndiningroom.",
    "As I say she was looking that way and pausing for a moment before coming downstairs.",
    "She was\nshifting slightly the angle of the vase as it was a rather awkward thing to carry and weighty if it was as I presumed\nfull of water.",
    "She was shifting the position of it rather carefully so that she could hold it to her with one arm and put\nout the other arm to the rail of the staircase as she came round the slightly shaped corner stairway.",
    "She stood there\nfor a moment or two still not looking at what she was carrying but towards the hall below.",
    "And suddenly she made\na sudden movement  a start I would describe it as  yes definitely something had startled her.",
    "So much so that she\nrelinquished her hold of the vase and it fell reversing itself as it did so  so that the water streamed over her and the\nvase itself crashed down to the hall below where it broke in smithereens on the hall floor.",
    "I see said Poirot.",
    "He paused a minute or two watching her.",
    "Her eyes he noticed were shrewd and\nknowledgeable.",
    "They were asking now his opinion of what she was telling him.",
    "What did you think had happened to startle her\nOn reflection afterwards I thought she had seen something.",
    "You thought she had seen something repeated Poirot thoughtfully.",
    "Such as\nThe direction of her eyes as I have told you was towards the door of the library.",
    "It seems to me possible that she\nmay have seen that door open or the handle turn or indeed she might have seen something slightly more than that.",
    "She might have seen somebody who was opening that door and preparing to come out of it.",
    "She may have seen\nsomeone she did not expect to see.",
    "Were you looking at the door yourself\nNo.",
    "I was looking in the opposite direction up the stairs towards Mrs Drake.",
    "And you think definitely that she saw something that startled her\nYes.",
    "No more than that perhaps.",
    "A door opening.",
    "A person just possibly an unlikely person emerging.",
    "Just\nsufficient to make her relinquish her grasp on the very heavy vase full of water and flowers so that she dropped it.",
    "Did you see anyone come out of that door\nNo.",
    "I was not looking that way.",
    "I do not think anyone actually did come out into the hall.",
    "Presumably whoever it\nwas drew back into the room.",
    "What did Mrs Drake do next\nShe made a sharp exclamation of vexation came down the stairs and said to me\nLook what Ive done now What a mess She kicked some of the broken glass away.",
    "I helped her sweep it in a\nbroken pile into a corner.",
    "It wasnt practicable to clear it all up at that moment.",
    "The children were beginning to come\nout of the Snapdragon room.",
    "I fetched a glass cloth and mopped her up a bit and shortly after that the party came to\nan end.",
    "Mrs Drake did not say anything about having been startled or make any reference as to what might have startled\nher\nNo.",
    "Nothing of the kind.",
    "But you think she was startled.",
    "Possibly Monsieur Poirot you think that I am making a rather unnecessary fuss about something of no importance\nwhatever\nNo said Poirot I do not think that at all.",
    "I have only met Mrs Drake once he added thoughtfully when I went\nto her house with my friend Mrs Oliver to visit  as one might say if one wishes to be melodramatic  the scene of\nthe crime.",
    "It did not strike me during the brief period I had for observation that Mrs Drake could be a woman who is\neasily startled.",
    "Do you agree with my view\nCertainly.",
    "That is why I myself since have wondered.",
    "You asked no special questions at the time\nI had no earthly reason to do so.",
    "If your hostess has been unfortunate enough to drop one of her best glass vases\nand it has smashed to smithereens it is hardly the part of a guest to say What on earth made you do that thereby\naccusing her of a clumsiness which I can assure you is not one of Mrs Drakes characteristics.",
    "And after that as you have said the party came to an end.",
    "The children and their mothers or friends left and Joyce\ncould not be found.",
    "We know now that Joyce was behind the library door and that Joyce was dead.",
    "So who could it\nhave been who was about to come out of the library door a little while earlier shall we say and then hearing voices\nin the hall shut the door again and made an exit later when there were people milling about in the hall making their\nfarewells putting on their coats and all the rest of it It was not until after the body had been found I presume Miss\n\n\fWhittaker that you had time to reflect on what you had seen\nThat is so.",
    "Miss Whittaker rose to her feet.",
    "Im afraid theres nothing else that I can tell you.",
    "Even this may be a\nvery foolish little matter.",
    "But noticeable.",
    "Everything noticeable is worth remembering.",
    "By the way there is one question I should like to ask\nyou.",
    "Two as a matter of fact.",
    "Elizabeth Whittaker sat down again.",
    "Go on she said ask anything you like.",
    "Can you remember exactly the order in which the various events occurred at the party\nI think so.",
    "Elizabeth Whittaker reflected for a moment or two.",
    "It started with a broomstick competition.",
    "Decorated broomsticks.",
    "There were three or four different small prizes for that.",
    "Then there was a kind of contest\nwith balloons punching them and batting them about.",
    "A sort of mild horseplay to get the children warmed up.",
    "There was a lookingglass business where the girls went into a small room and held a mirror where a boys or young\nmans face reflected in it.",
    "How was that managed\nOh very simply.",
    "The transom of the door had been removed and so different faces looked through and were\nreflected in the mirror a girl was holding.",
    "Did the girls know who it was they saw reflected in the glass\nI presume some of them did and some of them didnt.",
    "A little makeup was employed on the male half of the\narrangement.",
    "You know a mask or a wig sideburns a beard some greasepaint effects.",
    "Most of the boys were\nprobably known to the girls already and one or two strangers might have been included.",
    "Anyway there was a lot of\nquite happy giggling said Miss Whittaker showing for a moment or two a kind of academic contempt for this kind\nof fun.",
    "After that there was an obstacle race and then there was flour packed into a glass tumbler and reversed sixpence\nlaid on top and everyone took a slice off.",
    "When the flour collapsed that person was out of the competition and the\nothers remained until the last one claimed the sixpence.",
    "After that there was dancing and then there was supper.",
    "After that as a final climax came the Snapdragon.",
    "When did you yourself see the girl Joyce last\nIve no idea said Elizabeth Whittaker.",
    "I dont know her very well.",
    "Shes not in my class.",
    "She wasnt a very\ninteresting girl so I wouldnt have been watching her.",
    "I do remember I saw her cutting the flour because she was so\nclumsy that she capsized it almost at once.",
    "So  she was alive then but that was quite early on.",
    "You did not see her go into the library with anyone\nCertainly not.",
    "I should have mentioned it before if I had.",
    "That at least might have been significant and important.",
    "And now said Poirot for my second question or questions.",
    "How long have you been at the school here\nSix years this next autumn.",
    "And you teach\nMathematics and Latin.",
    "Do you remember a girl who was teaching here two years ago Janet White by name\nElizabeth Whittaker stiffened.",
    "She half rose from her chair then sat down again.",
    "But that but that has nothing to do with all this surely\n\n\fIt could have said Poirot.",
    "But how In what way\nScholastic circles were less well informed than village gossip Poirot thought.",
    "Joyce claimed before witnesses to have seen a murder done some years ago.",
    "Could that possibly have been the\nmurder of Janet White do you think How did Janet White die\nShe was strangled walking home from the school one night.",
    "Alone\nProbably not alone.",
    "But not with Nora Ambrose\nWhat do you know about Nora Ambrose\nNothing as yet said Poirot but I should like to.",
    "What were they like Janet White and Nora Ambrose\nOversexed said Elizabeth Whittaker but in different ways.",
    "How could Joyce have seen anything of the kind or\nknow anything about it It took place in a lane near the Quarry Wood.",
    "She wouldnt have been more than ten or\neleven years old.",
    "Which one had the boy friend asked Poirot.",
    "Nora or Janet\nAll this is past history.",
    "Old sins have long shadows quoted Poirot.",
    "As we advance through life we learn the truth of that saying.",
    "Where\nis Nora Ambrose now\nShe left the school and took another post in the north of England  she was naturally very upset.",
    "They were great\nfriends.",
    "The police never solved the case\nMiss Whittaker shook her head.",
    "She got up and looked at her watch.",
    "I must go now.",
    "Thank you for what you have told me.",
    "Chapter 11\nHercule Poirot looked up at the fa\u00e7ade of Quarry House.",
    "A solid wellbuilt example of mid Victorian architecture.",
    "He had a vision of its interior  a heavy mahogany sideboard a central rectangular table also of heavy mahogany a\nbilliard room perhaps a large kitchen with adjacent scullery stone flags on the floor a massive coal range now no\ndoubt replaced by electricity or gas.",
    "He noted that most of the upper windows were still curtained.",
    "He rang the\nfrontdoor bell.",
    "It was answered by a thin greyhaired woman who told him that Colonel and Mrs Weston were away\nin London and would not be back until next week.",
    "He asked about the Quarry Woods and was told that they were open to the public without charge.",
    "The entrance was\nabout five minutes walk along the road.",
    "He would see a noticeboard on an iron gate.",
    "He found his way there easily enough and passing through the gate began to descend a path that led downwards\nthrough trees and shrubs.",
    "Presently he came to a halt and stood there lost in thought.",
    "His mind was not only on what\nhe saw on what lay around him.",
    "Instead he was cunning over one or two sentences and reflecting over one or two\nfacts that had given him at the time as he expressed it to himself furiously to think.",
    "A forged Will a forged Will\nand a girl.",
    "A girl who had disappeared the girl in whose favour the Will had been forged.",
    "A young artist who had come here professionally to make out of an abandoned quarry of rough stone a garden a\nsunk garden.",
    "Here again Poirot looked round him and nodded his head with approval of the phrase.",
    "A Quarry\nGarden was an ugly term.",
    "It suggested the noise of blasting rock the carrying away by lorries of vast masses of\nstone for road making.",
    "It had behind it industrial demand.",
    "But a Sunk Garden  that was different.",
    "It brought with it\nvague remembrances in his own mind.",
    "So Mrs LlewellynSmythe had gone on a National Trust tour of gardens in\nIreland.",
    "He himself he remembered had been in Ireland five or six years ago.",
    "He had gone there to investigate a\nrobbery of old family silver.",
    "There had been some interesting points about the case which had aroused his curiosity\nand having as usual  Poirot added this bracket to his thoughts  solved his mission with full success he had put in\na few days travelling around and seeing the sights.",
    "He could not remember now the particular garden he had been to see.",
    "Somewhere he thought not very far from\nCork.",
    "Killarney No not Killarney.",
    "Somewhere not far from Bantry Bay.",
    "And he remembered it because it had been\na garden quite different from the gardens which he had so far acclaimed as the great successes of this age the\ngardens of the Chateaux in France the formal beauty of Versailles.",
    "Here he remembered he had started with a little\ngroup of people in a boat.",
    "A boat difficult to get into if two strong and able boatmen had not practically lifted him in.",
    "They had rowed towards a small island not a very interesting island Poirot had thought and began to wish that he\nhad not come.",
    "His feet were wet and cold and that wind was blowing through the crevices of his mackintosh.",
    "What beauty he had thought what formality what symmetrical arrangement of great beauty could there be on this\nrocky island with its sparse trees A mistake  definitely a mistake.",
    "They had landed at the little wharf.",
    "The fishermen had landed him with the same adroitness they had shown before.",
    "The remaining members of the party had gone on ahead talking and laughing.",
    "Poirot readjusting his mackintosh in\nposition and tying up his shoes again had followed them up the rather dull path with shrubs and bushes and a few\nsparse trees on either side.",
    "A most uninteresting park he thought.",
    "And then rather suddenly they had come out from among the scrub on to a terrace with steps leading down from it.",
    "Below it he had looked down into what struck him at once as something entirely magical.",
    "Something as it might\nhave been if elemental beings such as he believed were common in Irish poetry had come out of their hollow hills\nand had created there not so much by toil and hard labour as by waving a magic wand a garden.",
    "You looked down\ninto the garden.",
    "Its beauty the flowers and bushes the artificial water below in the fountain the path round it\nenchanted beautiful and entirely unexpected.",
    "He wondered how it had been originally.",
    "It seemed too symmetrical to have been a quarry.",
    "A deep hollow here in\nthe raised ground of the island but beyond it you could see the waters of the Bay and the hills rising the other side\ntheir misty tops an enchanting scene.",
    "He thought perhaps that it might have been that particular garden which had\nstirred Mrs LlewellynSmythe to possess such a garden of her own to have the pleasure of taking an unkempt\nquarry set in this smug tidy elementary and essentially conventional countryside of that part of England.",
    "And so she had looked about for the proper kind of wellpaid slave to do her bidding.",
    "And she had found the\nprofessionally qualified young man called Michael Garfield and had brought him here and had paid him no doubt a\nlarge fee and had in due course built a house for him.",
    "Michael Garfield thought Poirot looking round him had not\nfailed her.",
    "He went and sat down on a bench a bench which had been strategically placed.",
    "He pictured to himself what the\nsunken quarry would look like in the spring.",
    "There were young beech trees and birches with their white shivering\nbarks.",
    "Bushes of thorn and white rose little juniper trees.",
    "But now it was autumn and autumn had been catered for\nalso.",
    "The gold and red of acers a parrot or two a path that led along a winding way to fresh delights.",
    "There were flowering bushes of gorse or Spanish broom  Poirot was not famous for knowing the names of either\nflowers or shrubs  only roses and tulips could he approve and recognise.",
    "But everything that grew here had the appearance of having grown by its own will.",
    "It had not been arranged or\nforced into submission.",
    "And yet thought Poirot that is not really so.",
    "All has been arranged all has been planned to\nthis tiny little plant that grows here and to that large towering bush that rises up so fiercely with its golden and red\nleaves.",
    "Oh yes.",
    "All has been planned here and arranged.",
    "What is more I would say that it had obeyed.",
    "He wondered\n\n\fthen whom it had obeyed.",
    "Mrs LlewellynSmythe or Mr Michael Garfield It makes a difference said Poirot to himself yes it makes a\ndifference.",
    "Mrs LlewellynSmythe was knowledgeable he felt sure.",
    "She had gardened for many years she was no\ndoubt a Fellow of the Royal Horticultural Society she went to shows she consulted catalogues she visited gardens.",
    "She took journeys abroad no doubt for botanical reasons.",
    "She would know what she wanted she would say what\nshe wanted.",
    "Was that enough\nPoirot thought it was not quite enough.",
    "She could have given orders to gardeners and made sure her orders were\ncarried out.",
    "But did she know  really know  see in her minds eye exactly what her orders would look like when\nthey had been carried out\nNot in the first year of their planting not even the second but things that she would see two years later three years\nlater perhaps even six or seven years later.",
    "Michael Garfield thought Poirot Michael Garfield knows what she wants because she has told him what she wants\nand he knows how to make this bare quarry of stone and rock blossom as a desert can blossom.",
    "He planned and he\nbrought it about he had no doubt the intense pleasure that comes to an artist who is commissioned by a client with\nplenty of money.",
    "Here was his conception of a fairyland tucked away in a conventional and rather dull hillside and\nhere it would grow up.",
    "Expensive shrubs for which large cheques would have to be written and rare plants that\nperhaps would only be obtainable through the goodwill of a friend and here too the humble things that were\nneeded and which cost next to nothing at all.",
    "In spring on the bank just to his left there would be primroses their\nmodest green leaves all bunched together up the side of it told him that.",
    "In England said Poirot people show you their herbaceous borders and they take you to see their roses and they\ntalk at inordinate length about their iris gardens and to show they appreciate one of the great beauties of England\nthey take you on a day when the sun shines and the beech trees are in leaf and underneath them are all the bluebells.",
    "Yes it is a very beautiful sight but I have been shown it I think once too often.",
    "I prefer  the thought broke off in\nhis mind as he thought back to what he had preferred.",
    "A drive through Devon lanes.",
    "A winding road with great\nbanks going up each side of it and on those banks a great carpet and showing of primroses.",
    "So pale so subtly and\ntimidly yellow and coming from them that sweet faint elusive smell that the primrose has in large quantities\nwhich is the smell of spring almost more than any other smell.",
    "And so it would not be all rare shrubs here.",
    "There\nwould be spring and autumn there would be little wild cyclamen and there would be autumn crocus here too.",
    "It was\na beautiful place.",
    "He wondered about the people who lived in Quarry House now.",
    "He had their names a retired elderly Colonel and\nhis wife but surely he thought Spence might have told him more about them.",
    "He had the feeling that whoever\nowned this now had not got the love of it that dead Mrs LlewellynSmythe had had.",
    "He got up and walked along the\npath a little way.",
    "It was an easy path carefully levelled designed he thought to be easy for an elderly person to\nwalk where she would at will without undue amount of steep steps and at a convenient angle at convenient\nintervals a seat that looked rustic but was much less rustic than it looked.",
    "In fact the angle for the back and for ones\nfeet was remarkably comfortable.",
    "Poirot thought to himself Id like to see this Michael Garfield.",
    "He made a good\nthing of this.",
    "He knew his job he was a good planner and he got experienced people to carry his plans out and he\nmanaged I think to get his patrons plans so arranged that she would think that the whole planning had been hers.",
    "But I dont think it was only hers.",
    "It was mostly his.",
    "Yes Id like to see him.",
    "If hes still in the cottage  or the\nbungalow  that was built for him I suppose  his thought broke off.",
    "He stared.",
    "Stared across a hollow that lay at his feet where the path ran round the other side of it.",
    "Stared at one\nparticular golden red branching shrub which framed something that Poirot did not know for a moment was really\nthere or was a mere effect of shadow and sunshine and leaves.",
    "What am I seeing thought Poirot.",
    "Is this the result of enchantment\nIt could be.",
    "In this place here it could be.",
    "Is it a human being I see or is it  what could it be His mind reverted to\nsome adventures of his many years ago which he had christened The Labours of Hercules.",
    "Somehow he thought\nthis was not an English garden in which he was sitting.",
    "There was an atmosphere here.",
    "He tried to pin it down.",
    "It had\nqualities of magic of enchantment certainly of beauty bashful beauty yet wild.",
    "Here if you were staging a scene in\n\n\fthe theatre you would have your nymphs your fauns you would have Greek beauty you would have fear too.",
    "Yes he thought in this sunk garden there is fear.",
    "What did Spences sister say\nSomething about a murder that took place in the original quarry years ago Blood had stained the rock there and\nafterwards death had been forgotten all had been covered over Michael Garfield had come had planned and had\ncreated a garden of great beauty and an elderly woman who had not many more years to live had paid out money\nfor it.",
    "He saw now it was a young man who stood on the other side of the hollow framed by golden red leaves and a\nyoung man so Poirot now recognised of an unusual beauty.",
    "One didnt think of young men that way nowadays.",
    "You\nsaid of a young man that he was sexy or madly attractive and these evidences of praise are often quite justly made.",
    "A man with a craggy face a man with wild greasy hair and whose features were far from regular.",
    "You didnt say a young man was beautiful.",
    "If you did say it you said it apologetically as though you were praising some quality that had been long dead.",
    "The\nsexy girls didnt want Orpheus with his lute they wanted a pop singer with a raucous voice expressive eyes and\nlarge masses of unruly hair.",
    "Poirot got up and walked round the path.",
    "As he got to the other side of the steep descent the young man came out\nfrom the trees to meet him.",
    "His youth seemed the most characteristic thing about him yet as Poirot saw he was not\nreally young.",
    "He was past thirty perhaps nearer forty.",
    "The smile on his face was very very faint.",
    "It was not quite a\nwelcoming smile it was just a smile of quiet recognition.",
    "He was tall slender with features of great perfection such as a classical sculptor might have produced.",
    "His eyes\nwere dark his hair was black and fitted him as a woven chain mail helmet or cap might have done.",
    "For a moment\nPoirot wondered whether he and this young man might not be meeting in the course of some pageant that was being\nrehearsed.",
    "If so thought Poirot looking down at his galoshes I alas shall have to go to the wardrobe mistress to get\nmyself better equipped.",
    "He said\nI am perhaps trespassing here.",
    "If so I must apologise.",
    "I am a stranger in this part of the world.",
    "I only arrived\nyesterday.",
    "I dont think one could call it trespassing.",
    "The voice was very quiet it was polite yet in a curious way uninterested as if this mans thoughts were really\nsomewhere quite far away.",
    "Its not exactly open to the public but people do walk round here.",
    "Old Colonel Weston and his wife dont mind.",
    "They would mind if there was any damage done but thats not really very likely.",
    "No vandalism said Poirot looking round him.",
    "No litter that is noticeable.",
    "Not even a little basket.",
    "That is very\nunusual is it not And it seems deserted\n strange.",
    "Here you would think he went on there would be lovers walking.",
    "Lovers dont come here said the young man.",
    "Its supposed to be unlucky for some reason.",
    "Are you I wonder the architect But perhaps Im guessing wrong.",
    "My name is Michael Garfield said the young man.",
    "I thought it might be said Poirot.",
    "He gesticulated with a hand around him.",
    "You made this\nYes said Michael Garfield.",
    "It is very beautiful said Poirot.",
    "Somehow one feels it is always rather unusual when something beautiful is made\nin well frankly what is a dull part of the English landscape.",
    "I congratulate you he said.",
    "You must be satisfied with what you have done here.",
    "Is one ever satisfied I wonder.",
    "You made it I think for a Mrs LlewellynSmythe.",
    "No longer alive I believe.",
    "There is a Colonel and Mrs Weston I\nbelieve Do they own it now\nYes.",
    "They got it cheap.",
    "Its a big ungainly house not easy to run not what most people want.",
    "She left it in her Will\nto me.",
    "And you sold it.",
    "I sold the house.",
    "And not the Quarry Garden\nOh yes.",
    "The Quarry Garden went with it practically thrown in as one might say.",
    "Now why said Poirot.",
    "It is interesting that.",
    "You do not mind if I am perhaps a little curious\nYour questions are not quite the usual ones said Michael Garfield.",
    "I ask not so much for facts as for reasons.",
    "Why did A do so and so Why did B\ndo something else Why was Cs behaviour quite different from that of A and B\nYou should be talking to a scientist said Michael.",
    "It is a matter  or so we are told nowadays  of genes or\nchromosomes.",
    "The arrangement the pattern and so on.",
    "You said just now you were not entirely satisfied because no one ever was.",
    "Was your employer your patron\nwhatever you like to call her was she satisfied\nWith this thing of beauty\nUp to a point said Michael.",
    "I saw to that.",
    "She was easy to satisfy.",
    "That seems most unlikely said Hercule Poirot.",
    "She was I have learned over sixty.",
    "Sixtyfive at least.",
    "Are people\nof that age often satisfied\nShe was assured by me that what I had carried out was the exact carrying out of her instructions and imagination\nand ideas.",
    "And was it\nDo you ask me that seriously\nNo said Poirot.",
    "No.",
    "Frankly I do not.",
    "For success in life said Michael Garfield one has to pursue the career one wants one has to satisfy such artistic\nleanings as one has got but one has as well to be a tradesman.",
    "You have to sell your wares.",
    "Otherwise you are tied\nto carrying out other peoples ideas in a way which will not accord with ones own.",
    "I carried out mainly my own\nideas and I sold them marketed them perhaps is a better word to the client who employed me as a direct carrying\nout of her plans and schemes.",
    "It is not a very difficult art to learn.",
    "There is no more to it than selling a child brown\neggs rather than white ones.",
    "The customer has to be assured they are the best ones the right ones.",
    "The essence of the\ncountryside.",
    "Shall we say the hens own preference Brown farm country eggs.",
    "One does not sell them if one says\nThey are just eggs.",
    "There is only one difference in eggs.",
    "They are new laid or they are not\n\n\fYou are an unusual young man said Poirot.",
    "Arrogant he said thoughtfully.",
    "Perhaps.",
    "You have made here something very beautiful.",
    "You have added vision and planning to the rough material of stone\nhollowed out in the pursuit of industry with no thought of beauty in that hacking out.",
    "You have added imagination\na result seen in the minds eye that you have managed to raise the money to fulfill.",
    "I congratulate you.",
    "I pay my\ntribute.",
    "The tribute of an old man who is approaching a time when the end of his own work is come.",
    "But at the moment you are still carrying it on\nYou know who I am then\nPoirot was pleased indubitably.",
    "He liked people to know who he was.",
    "Nowadays he feared most people did not.",
    "You follow the trail of blood...",
    "It is already known here.",
    "It is a small community news travels.",
    "Another public\nsuccess brought you here.",
    "Ah you mean Mrs Oliver.",
    "Ariadne Oliver.",
    "A bestseller.",
    "People wish to interview her to know what she thinks about such subjects as student\nunrest socialism girls clothing should sex be permissive and many other things that are no concern of hers.",
    "Yes yes said Poirot deplorable I think.",
    "They do not learn very much I have noticed from Mrs Oliver.",
    "They\nlearn only that she is fond of apples.",
    "That has now been known for twenty years at least I should think but she still\nrepeats it with a pleasant smile.",
    "Although now I fear she no longer likes apples.",
    "It was apples that brought you here was it not\nApples at a Halloween party said Poirot.",
    "You were at that party\nNo.",
    "You were fortunate.",
    "Fortunate Michael Garfield repeated the word something that sounded faintly like surprise in his voice.",
    "To have been one of the guests at a party where murder is committed is not a pleasant experience.",
    "Perhaps you\nhave not experienced it but I tell you you are fortunate because  Poirot became a little more foreign  il ya a des\nennuis vous comprenez People ask you times dates impertinent questions.",
    "He went on You knew the child\nOh yes.",
    "The Reynolds are well known here.",
    "I know most of the people living round here.",
    "We all know each other in\nWoodleigh Common though in varying degrees.",
    "There is some intimacy some friendships some people remain\nmerest acquaintances and so on.",
    "What was she like the child Joyce\nShe was  how can I put it  not important.",
    "She had rather an ugly voice.",
    "Shrill.",
    "Really thats about all I remember\nabout her.",
    "Im not particularly fond of children.",
    "Mostly they bore me.",
    "Joyce bored me.",
    "When she talked she talked\nabout herself.",
    "She was not interesting\nMichael Garfield looked slightly surprised.",
    "I shouldnt think so he said.",
    "Does she have to be\nIt is my view that people devoid of interest are unlikely to be murdered.",
    "People are murdered for gain for fear or\nfor love.",
    "One takes ones choice but one has to have a starting point  He broke off and glanced at his watch.",

    "He was glad that for once he was not wearing his tight patent leather shoes.",
    "Michael\nGarfield was not the only person he was to meet in the sunk garden that day.",
    "As he reached the bottom he noted that\nthree paths led from there in slightly different directions.",
    "At the entrance of the middle path sitting on a fallen trunk\nof a tree a child was awaiting him.",
    "She made this clear at once.",
    "I expect you are Mr Hercule Poirot arent you she said.",
    "Her voice was clear almost belllike in tone.",
    "She was a\nfragile creature.",
    "Something about her matched the sunk garden.",

    "I asked Mummy to read some more.",
    "I liked it.",
    "It has a wonderful sound.",
    "A\nbrave new world.",
    "There isnt anything really like that is there\nYou dont believe in it\nDo you\nThere is always a brave new world said Poirot but only you know for very special people.",
    "The lucky ones.",
    "The\nones who carry the making of that world within themselves.",
    "Oh I see said Miranda with an air of apparently seeing with the utmost ease though what she saw Poirot rather\nwondered.",
    "She turned started along the path and said We go this way.",
    "Its not very far.",
    "You can go through the hedge of our\ngarden.",
    "Then she looked back over her shoulder and pointed saying\nIn the middle there thats where the fountain was.",
    "A fountain\nOh years ago.",
    "I suppose its still there underneath the shrubs and the azaleas and the other things.",
    "It was all broken\nup you see.",
    "People took bits of it away but nobody has put a new one there.",
    "It seems a pity.",
    "I dont know.",
    "Im not sure.",
    "Do you like fountains very much\n\u00c7a d\u00e9pend said Poirot.",
    "I know some French said Miranda.",
    "Thats it depends isnt it\nYou are quite right.",
    "You seem very well educated.",
    "Everyone says Miss Emlyn is a very fine teacher.",
    "Shes our headmistress.",
    "Shes awfully strict and a bit stern but\nshes terribly interesting sometimes in the things she tells us.",
    "Then she is certainly a good teacher said Hercule Poirot.",
    "You know this place very well you seem to know all\nthe paths.",
    "Do you come here often\nOh yes its one of my favourite walks.",
    "Nobody knows where I am you see when I come here.",

    "Birds are very quarrelsome arent they Not like in the bit of poetry that says birds in\ntheir little nests agree.",
    "They dont really do they And I watch squirrels.",
    "And you watch people\nSometimes.",
    "But there arent many people who come here.",
    "Why not I wonder\nI suppose they are afraid.",
    "Why should they be afraid\nBecause someone was killed here long ago.",
    "Before it was a garden I mean.",
    "It was a quarry once and then there was\na gravel pile or a sand pile and thats where they found her.",
    "Do you think the old saying is true  About youre born\nto be hanged or born to be drowned\nNobody is born to be hanged nowadays.",
    "You do not hang people any longer in this country.",
    "But they are hanging them in some other countries.",
    "They hang them in the streets.",
    "Ive read it in the papers.",
    "Ah.",
    "Do you think that is a good thing or a bad thing Mirandas response was not strictly in answer to the question\nbut Poirot felt that it was perhaps meant to be.",
    "Joyce was drowned she said.",
    "Mummy didnt want to tell me but that was rather silly I think dont you I mean\nIm twelve years old.",
    "Was Joyce a friend of yours\nYes.",
    "She was a great friend in a way.",
    "She told me very interesting things sometimes.",
    "All about elephants and\nrajahs.",
    "Shed been to India once.",

    "She was talking to Mrs Minden who comes and cleans.",
    "Someone held her head down\nin a bucket of water.",
    "Have you any idea who that someone was\nI shouldnt think so.",
    "They didnt seem to know but then theyre both rather stupid really.",
    "Do you know Miranda\nI wasnt there.",
    "I had a sore throat and a temperature so Mummy wouldnt take me to the party.",
    "But I think I could\nknow.",
    "Because she was drowned.",
    "Thats why I asked if you thought people were born to be drowned.",
    "We go through\nthe hedge here.",
    "Be careful of your clothes.",
    "Poirot followed her lead.",
    "The entrance through the hedge from the Quarry Garden was more suited to the build of\nhis childish guide with her elfin slimness it was practically a highway to her.",
    "She was solicitous for Poirot however\nwarning him of adjacent thorn bushes and holding back the more prickly components of the hedge.",
    "They emerged at\na spot in the garden adjacent to a compost heap and turned a corner by a derelict cucumber frame to where two\ndustbins stood.",
    "From there on a small neat garden mostly planted with roses gave easy access to the small bungalow\nhouse.",
    "Miranda led the way through an open french window announcing with the modest pride of a collector who\nhas just secured a sample of a rare beetle\nIve got him all right.",
    "Miranda you didnt bring him through the hedge did you You ought to have gone round by the path at the side\ngate.",
    "This is a better way said Miranda.",
    "Quicker and shorter.",
    "And much more painful I suspect.",
    "I forget said Mrs Oliver I did introduce you didnt I to my friend Mrs Butler\nOf course.",
    "In the post office.",
    "The introduction in question had been a matter of a few moments while there had been a queue in front of the\ncounter.",
    "Poirot was better able now to study Mrs Olivers friend at close quarters.",
    "Before it had been a matter of a slim\nwoman in a disguising headscarf and a mackintosh.",
    "Judith Butler was a woman of about thirtyfive and whilst her daughter resembled a dryad or a woodnymph Judith\nhad more the attributes of a water spirit.",
    "She could have been a Rhine maiden.",
    "Her long blonde hair hung limply on\nher shoulders she was delicately made with a rather long face and faintly hollow cheeks whilst above them were\nbig sea green eyes fringed with long eyelashes.",
    "Im very glad to thank you properly Monsieur Poirot said Mrs Butler.",
    "It was very good of you to come down\nhere when Ariadne asked you.",
    "When my friend Mrs Oliver asks me to do anything I always have to do it said Poirot.",
    "What nonsense said Mrs Oliver.",
    "She was sure quite sure that you would be able to find out all about this beastly thing.",
    "Miranda dear will you go\ninto the kitchen Youll find the scones on the wire tray above the oven.",
    "Miranda disappeared.",
    "She gave as she went a knowledgeable smile directed at her mother that said as plainly as a\nsmile could say Shes getting me out of the way for a short time.",
    "I tried not to let her know said Mirandas mother about this this horrible thing that happened.",
    "But I suppose that\nwas a forlorn chance from the start.",
    "Yes indeed said Poirot.",
    "Theres nothing that goes round any residential centre with the same rapidity as news of a\ndisaster and particularly an unpleasant disaster.",
    "And anyway he added one cannot go long through life without\nknowing what goes on around one.",
    "And children seem particularly apt at that sort of thing.",
    "I dont know if it was Burns or Sir Walter Scott who said Theres a child among you taking notes said Mrs\nOliver but he certainly knew what he was talking about.",
    "Joyce Reynolds certainly seems to have noticed such a thing as a murder said Mrs Butler.",
    "One can hardly believe\nit.",
    "Believe that Joyce noticed it\nI meant believe that if she saw such a thing she never spoke about it earlier.",
    "That seems very unlike Joyce.",
    "The first thing that everybody seems to tell me here said Poirot in a mild voice is that this girl Joyce Reynolds\nwas a liar.",
    "I suppose its possible said Judith Butler that a child might make up a thing and then it might turn out to be\ntrue\nThat is certainly the focal point from which we start said Poirot.",
    "Joyce Reynolds was unquestionably murdered.",
    "And you have started.",
    "Probably you know already all about it said Mrs Oliver.",
    "Madame do not ask impossibilities of me.",
    "You are always in such a hurry.",
    "Why not said Mrs Oliver.",
    "Nobody would ever get anything done nowadays if they werent in a hurry.",
    "Miranda returned at this moment with a plateful of scones.",
    "Shall I put them down here she asked.",
    "I expect youve finished talking by now havent you Or is there anything\nelse you would like me to get from the kitchen There was a gentle malice in her voice.",
    "Mrs Butler lowered the Georgian silver teapot to the fender switched on an electric kettle which had been turned off\njust before it came to the boil duly filled the teapot and served the tea.",
    "Miranda handed hot scones and cucumber\nsandwiches with a serious elegance of manner.",
    "Ariadne and I met in Greece said Judith.",
    "I fell into the sea said Mrs Oliver when we were coming back from one of the islands.",
    "It had got rather rough\nand the sailors always say jump and of course they say jump just when the things at its furthest point which makes\nit come right for you but you dont think that can possibly happen and so you dither and you lose your nerve and\nyou jump when it looks close and of course thats the moment when it goes far away.",
    "She paused for breath.",
    "Judith helped fish me out and it made a kind of bond between us didnt it\nYes indeed said Mrs Butler.",
    "Besides I liked your Christian name she added.",
    "It seemed very appropriate\nsomehow.",
    "Yes I suppose it is a Greek name said Mrs Oliver.",
    "Its my own you know.",
    "I didnt just make it up for literary\npurposes.",
    "But nothing Ariadnelike has ever happened to me.",
    "Ive never been deserted on a Greek island by my own\ntrue love or anything like that.",
    "Poirot raised a hand to his moustache in order to hide the slight smile that he could not help coming to his lips as he\nenvisaged Mrs Oliver in the role of a deserted Greek maiden.",
    "We cant all live up to our names said Mrs Butler.",
    "No indeed.",
    "I cant see you in the role of cutting off your lovers head.",
    "That is the way it happened isnt it Judith\nand Holofernes I mean\nIt was her patriotic duty said Mrs Butler for which if I remember rightly she was highly commended and\nrewarded.",
    "Im not really very well up in Judith and Holofernes.",
    "Its the Apochrypha isnt it Still if one comes to think of it\npeople do give other people  their children I mean  some very queer names dont they Who was the one who\nhammered some nails in someones head Jael or Sisera.",
    "I never remember which is the man or which is the woman\nthere.",
    "Jael I think.",
    "I dont think I remember any child having been christened Jael.",
    "She laid butter before him in a lordly dish said Miranda unexpectedly pausing as she was about to remove the\nteatray.",
    "Dont look at me said Judith Butler to her friend it wasnt I who introduced Miranda to the Apochrypha.",
    "Thats\nher school training.",
    "Rather unusual for schools nowadays isnt it said Mrs Oliver.",
    "They give them ethical ideas instead dont they\nNot Miss Emlyn said Miranda.",
    "She says that if we go to church nowadays we only get the modern version of the\nBible read to us in the lessons and things and that it has no literary merit whatsoever.",
    "We should at least know the\nfine prose and blank verse sometimes of the Authorised Version.",
    "I enjoyed the story of Jael and Sisera very much\nshe added.",
    "Its not a thing she said meditatively that I should ever have thought of doing myself.",
    "Hammering\nnails I mean into someones head when they were asleep.",
    "I hope not indeed said her mother.",
    "And how would you dispose of your enemies Miranda asked Poirot.",
    "I should be very kind said Miranda in a gently contemplative tone.",
    "It would be more difficult but Id rather have\nit that way because I dont like hurting things.",
    "Id use a sort of drug that gives people euthanasia.",
    "They would go to\nsleep and have beautiful dreams and they just wouldnt wake up.",
    "She lifted some tea cups and the bread and butter\nplate.",
    "Ill wash up Mummy she said if youd like to take Monsieur Poirot to look at the garden.",
    "There are still some\nQueen Elizabeth roses at the back of the border.",
    "She went out of the room carefully carrying the teatray.",
    "Shes an astonishing child Miranda said Mrs Oliver.",
    "You have a very beautiful daughter Madame said Poirot.",
    "Yes I think she is beautiful now.",
    "One doesnt know what they will look like by the time they grow up.",
    "They\nacquire puppy fat and look like wellfattened pigs sometimes.",
    "But now  now she is like a woodnymph.",
    "One does not wonder that she is fond of the Quarry Garden which adjoins your house.",
    "I wish she wasnt so fond of it sometimes.",
    "One gets nervous about people wandering about in isolated places even\n\n\fif they are quite near people or a village.",
    "Ones  oh ones frightened all the time nowadays.",
    "Thats why  why youve\ngot to find out why this awful thing happened to Joyce Monsieur Poirot.",
    "Because until we know who that was we\nshant feel safe for a minute  about our children I mean.",
    "Take Monsieur Poirot out in the garden will you Ariadne\nIll join you in a minute or two.",
    "She took the remaining two cups and a plate and went into the kitchen.",
    "Poirot and Mrs Oliver went out through the\nfrench window.",
    "The small garden was like most autumn gardens.",
    "It retained a few candles of golden rod and\nmichaelmas daisies in a border and some Queen Elizabeth roses held their pink statuesque heads up high.",
    "Mrs Oliver walked rapidly down to where there was a stone bench sat down and motioned Poirot to sit down\nbeside her.",
    "You said you thought Miranda was like a woodnymph she said.",
    "What do you think of Judith\nI think Judiths name ought to be Undine said Poirot.",
    "A waterspirit yes.",
    "Yes she does look as though shed just come out of the Rhine or the sea or a forest pool or\nsomething.",
    "Her hair looks as though it had been dipped in water.",
    "Yet theres nothing untidy or scatty about her is\nthere\nShe too is a very lovely woman said Poirot.",
    "What do you think about her\nI have not had time to think as yet.",
    "I just think that she is beautiful and attractive and that something is giving her\nvery great concern.",
    "Well of course wouldnt it\nWhat I would like Madame is for you to tell me what you know or think about her.",
    "Well I got to know her very well on the cruise.",
    "You know one does make quite intimate friends.",
    "Just one or two\npeople.",
    "The rest of them I mean they like each other and all that but you dont really go to any trouble to see them\nagain.",
    "But one or two you do.",
    "Well Judith was one of the ones I did want to see again.",
    "You did not know her before the cruise\nNo.",
    "But you know something about her\nWell just ordinary things.",
    "Shes a widow said Mrs Oliver.",
    "Her husband died a good many years ago  he was an\nair pilot.",
    "He was killed in a car accident.",
    "One of those pileup things I think it was coming off the whatisit that\nruns near here on to the ordinary road one evening or something of that kind.",
    "He left her rather badly off I imagine.",
    "She was very broken up about it I think.",
    "She doesnt like talking about him.",
    "Is Miranda her only child\nYes.",
    "Judith does some parttime secretarial work in the neighbourhood but she hasnt got a fixed job.",
    "Did she know the people who lived at the Quarry House\nYou mean old Colonel and Mrs Weston\nI mean the former owner Mrs LlewellynSmythe wasnt it\nI think so.",
    "I think Ive heard that name mentioned.",
    "But she died two or three years ago so of course one doesnt hear\nabout her much.",
    "Arent the people who are alive enough for you demanded Mrs Oliver with some irritation.",
    "Certainly not said Poirot.",
    "I have also to inquire into those who have died or disappeared from the scene.",
    "Whos disappeared\nAn au pair girl said Poirot.",
    "Oh well said Mrs Oliver theyre always disappearing arent they I mean they come over here and get their fare\npaid and then they go straight into hospital because theyre pregnant and have a baby and call it Auguste or Hans or\nBoris or some name like that.",
    "Or theyve come over to marry someone or to follow up some young man theyre in\nlove with.",
    "You wouldnt believe the things friends tell me The thing about au pair girls seems to be either theyre\nHeavens gift to overworked mothers and you never want to part with them or they pinch your stockings  or get\nthemselves murdered  She stopped.",
    "Oh she said.",
    "Calm yourself Madame said Poirot.",
    "There seems no reason to believe that an au pair girl has been murdered quite the contrary.",
    "What do you mean by quite the contrary It doesnt make sense.",
    "Probably not.",
    "All the same  He took out his notebook and made an entry in it.",
    "What are you writing down there\nCertain things that have occurred in the past.",
    "You seem to be very perturbed by the past altogether.",
    "The past is the father of the present said Poirot sententiously.",
    "He offered her the notebook.",
    "Do you wish to see what I have written\nOf course I do.",
    "I daresay it wont mean anything to me.",
    "The things you think important to write down I never do.",
    "He held out the small black notebook.",
    "Deaths e.g.",
    "Mrs LlewellynSmythe Wealthy.",
    "Janet White Schoolteacher.",
    "Lawyers clerk  Knifed Former\nprosecution for forgery.",
    "Below it was written Opera girl disappears.",
    "What opera girl\n\n\fIt is the word my friend Spences sister uses for what you and I call au pair girl.",
    "Why should she disappear\nBecause she was possibly about to get into some form of legal trouble.",
    "Poirots finger went down to the next entry.",
    "The word was simply Forgery with two question marks after it.",
    "Forgery said Mrs Oliver.",
    "Why forgery\nThat is what I asked.",
    "Why forgery\nWhat kind of forgery\nA Will was forged or rather a codicil to a Will.",
    "A codicil in the au pair girls favour.",
    "Undue influence suggested Mrs Oliver.",
    "Forgery is something rather more serious than undue influence said Poirot.",
    "I dont see what thats got to do with the murder of poor Joyce.",
    "Nor do I said Poirot.",
    "But therefore it is interesting.",
    "What is the next word I cant read it.",
    "Elephants.",
    "I dont see what thats got to do with anything.",
    "It might have said Poirot believe me it might have.",

    "Why\nTo talk about forgery and other matters.",
    "And after that\nI want to talk to certain people who were also present.",
    "At the party\nNo  at the preparations for the party.",
    "Chapter 12\nThe premises of Fullerton Harrison and Leadbetter were typical of an oldfashioned firm of the utmost respectability.",
    "The hand of time had made itself felt.",
    "There were no more Harrisons and no more Leadbetters.",
    "There was a Mr\n\n\fAtkinson and a young Mr Cole and there was still Mr Jeremy Fullerton senior partner.",
    "A lean elderly man Mr Fullerton with an impassive face a dry legal voice and eyes that were unexpectedly\nshrewd.",
    "Beneath his hand rested a sheet of notepaper the few words on which he had just read.",
    "He read them once again\nassessing their meaning very exactly.",
    "Then he looked at the man whom the note introduced to him.",
    "Monsieur Hercule Poirot He made his own assessment of the visitor.",
    "An elderly man a foreigner very dapper in\nhis dress unsuitably attired as to the feet in patent leather shoes which were so Mr Fullerton guessed shrewdly too\ntight for him.",
    "Faint lines of pain were already etching themselves round the corners of his eyes.",
    "A dandy a fop a\nforeigner and recommended to him by of all people Inspector Henry Raglan CID and also vouched for by\nSuperintendent Spence retired formerly of Scotland Yard.",
    "Superintendent Spence eh said Mr Fullerton.",
    "Fullerton knew Spence.",
    "A man who had done good work in his time had been highly thought of by his superiors.",
    "Faint memories flashed across his mind.",
    "Rather a celebrated case more celebrated actually than it had showed any\nsigns of being a case that had seemed cut and dried.",
    "Of course It came to him that his nephew Robert had been\nconnected with it had been Junior Counsel.",
    "A psychopathic killer it had seemed a man who had hardly bothered to\ntry and defend himself a man whom you might have thought really wanted to be hanged because it had meant\nhanging at that time.",
    "No fifteen years or indefinite number of years in prison.",
    "No.",
    "You paid the full penalty and\nmores the pity theyve given it up so Mr Fullerton thought in his dry mind.",
    "The young thugs nowadays thought they didnt risk much by prolonging assault to the point where it became mortal.",
    "Once your man was dead thered be no witness to identify you.",
    "Spence had been in charge of the case a quiet dogged man who had insisted all along that theyd got the wrong\nman.",
    "And they had got the wrong man and the person who found the evidence that theyd got the wrong man was\nsome sort of an amateurish foreigner.",
    "Some retired detective chap from the Belgian police force.",
    "A good age then.",
    "And now  senile probably thought Mr Fullerton but all the same he himself would take the prudent course.",
    "Information thats what was wanted from him.",
    "Information which after all could not be a mistake to give since he\ncould not see that he was likely to have any information that could be useful in this particular matter.",
    "A case of child\nhomicide.",
    "Mr Fullerton might think he had a fairly shrewd idea of who had committed that homicide but he was not so sure as\nhe would like to be because there were at least three claimants in the matter.",
    "Any one of three young neerdowells\nmight have done it.",
    "Words floated through his head.",
    "Mentally retarded.",
    "Psychiatrists report.",
    "Thats how the whole\nmatter would end no doubt.",
    "All the same to drown a child during a party that was rather a different cup of tea from\none of the innumerable school children who did not arrive home and who had accepted a lift in a car after having\nbeen repeatedly warned not to do so and who had been found in a nearby copse or gravel pit.",
    "A gravel pit now.",
    "When was that Many many years ago now.",
    "All this took about four minutes time and Mr Fullerton then cleared his throat in a slightly asthmatic fashion and\nspoke.",
    "Monsieur Hercule Poirot he said again.",
    "What can I do for you I suppose its the business of this young girl\nJoyce Reynolds.",

    "She wasnt a hypochondriac type.",
    "He coughed and said But I\nexpect we are getting away from the subject about which you came to talk to me.",
    "Not really said Poirot although I would like if I may to ask you a few questions on a completely different\nmatter.",
    "Some information about one of your employees by name Lesley Ferrier.",
    "Mr Fullerton looked somewhat surprised.",
    "Lesley Ferrier he said.",
    "Lesley Ferrier.",
    "Let me see.",
    "Really you know Id nearly forgotten his name.",
    "Yes yes of course.",
    "Got himself\nknifed didnt he\nThat is the man I mean.",
    "Well I dont really know that I can tell you much about him.",
    "It took place some time ago.",
    "Knifed near the Green\nSwan one night.",
    "No arrest was ever made.",
    "I daresay the police had some idea who was responsible but it was\nmainly I think a matter of getting evidence.",
    "The motive was emotional inquired Poirot.",
    "Oh yes I should certainly think so.",
    "Jealousy you know.",
    "Hed been going steady with a married woman.",
    "Her\nhusband had a pub.",
    "The Green Swan at Woodleigh Common.",
    "Unpretentious place.",
    "Then it seems young Lesley\nstarted playing around with another young woman  or more than one it was said.",
    "Quite a one for the girls he was.",
    "There was a bit of trouble once or twice.",
    "You were satisfied with him as an employee\nI would rather describe it as not dissatisfied.",
    "He had his points.",
    "He handled clients well and was studying for his\narticles and if only hed paid more attention to his position and keeping up a good standard of behaviour it would\nhave been better instead of mixing himself up with one girl after another most of whom I am apt in my oldfashioned way to consider as considerably beneath him in station.",
    "There was a row one night at the Green Swan and\nLesley Ferrier was knifed on his way home.",
    "Was one of the girls responsible or would it be Mrs Green Swan do you think\nReally it is not a case of knowing anything definite.",
    "I believe the police considered it was a case of jealousy but \nHe shrugged his shoulders.",
    "But you are not sure\n\n\fOh it happens said Mrs Fullerton.",
    "Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.",
    "That is always being quoted in Court.",
    "Sometimes its true.",
    "But I think I discern that you yourself are not at all sure that that was the case here.",
    "Well I should have preferred rather more evidence shall we say.",
    "The police would have preferred rather more\nevidence too.",
    "Public prosecutor threw it out I believe.",
    "It could have been something quite different\nOh yes.",
    "One could propound several theories.",
    "Not a very stable character young Ferrier.",
    "Well brought up.",
    "Nice\nmother  a widow.",
    "Father not so satisfactory.",
    "Got himself out of several scrapes by the skin of his teeth.",
    "Hard luck\non his wife.",
    "Our young man in some ways resembled his father.",
    "He was associated once or twice with rather a\ndoubtful crowd.",
    "I gave him the benefit of the doubt.",
    "He was young still.",
    "But I warned him that he was getting\nhimself mixed up with the wrong lot.",
    "Too closely connected with fiddling transactions outside the law.",
    "Frankly but\nfor his mother I wouldnt have kept him.",
    "He was young and he had ability I gave him a warning or two which I\nhoped might do the trick.",
    "But theres a lot of corruption about these days.",
    "Its been on the increase for the last ten\nyears.",
    "Someone might have had it in for him you think\nQuite possible.",
    "These associations  gangs is a rather melodramatic word  but you run a certain danger when you\nget tangled up with them.",
    "Any idea that you may split on them and a knife between your shoulder blades isnt an\nuncommon thing to happen.",
    "Nobody saw it happen\nNo.",
    "Nobody saw it happen.",
    "They wouldnt of course.",
    "Whoever took the job on would have all the arrangements\nnicely made.",
    "Alibi at the proper place and time and so on and so on.",
    "Yet somebody might have seen it happen.",
    "Somebody quite unlikely.",
    "A child for instance.",
    "Late at night In the neighbourhood of the Green Swan Hardly a very credible idea Monsieur Poirot.",
    "A child persisted Poirot who might remember.",
    "A child coming home from a friends house.",
    "At some short\ndistance perhaps from her own home.",
    "She might have been coming by a footpath or seen something from behind a\nhedge.",
    "Really Monsieur Poirot what an imagination you have got.",
    "What you are saying seems to me most unlikely.",
    "It does not seem so unlikely to me said Poirot.",
    "Children do see things.",
    "They are so often you see not expected to\nbe where they are.",
    "But surely when they go home and relate what they have seen\nThey might not said Poirot.",
    "They might not you see be sure what they had seen.",
    "Especially if what they had\nseen had been faintly frightening to them.",
    "Children do not always go home and report a street accident they have\nseen or some unexpected violence.",
    "Children keep their secrets very well.",
    "Keep them and think about them.",
    "Sometimes they like to feel that they know a secret a secret which they are keeping for themselves.",
    "Theyd tell their mothers said Mr Fullerton.",
    "I am not so sure of that said Poirot.",
    "In my experience the things that children do not tell their mothers are quite\nnumerous.",
    "What interests you so much may I know about this case of Lesley Ferrier The regrettable death of a young man\nby a violence which is so lamentably often amongst us nowadays\n\n\fI know nothing about him.",
    "But I wanted to know something about him because his is a violent death that occurred\nnot many years ago.",
    "That might be important to me.",
    "You know Mr Poirot said Mr Fullerton with some slight acerbity I really cannot quite make out why you have\ncome to me and in what you are really interested.",
    "You cannot surely suspect any tieup between the death of Joyce\nReynolds and the death of a young man of promise but slightly criminal activities who has been dead for some\nyears\nOne can suspect anything said Poirot.",
    "One has to find out more.",
    "Excuse me what one has to have in all matters dealing with crime is evidence.",
    "You have perhaps heard that the dead girl Joyce was heard by several witnesses to say that she had with her own\neyes witnessed a murder.",
    "In a place like this said Mr Fullerton one usually hears any rumour that may be going round.",
    "One usually hears\nit too if I may add these words in a singularly exaggerated form not usually worthy of credence.",
    "That also said Poirot is quite true.",
    "Joyce was I gather just thirteen years of age.",
    "A child of nine could remember\nsomething she had seen  a hitandrun accident a fight or a struggle with knives on a dark evening or a\nschoolteacher who was strangled say  all these things might leave a very strong impression on a childs mind about\nwhich she would not speak being uncertain perhaps of the actual facts she had seen and mulling them over in her\nown mind.",
    "Forgetting about them even possibly until something happened to remind her.",
    "You agree that that is a\npossible happening\nOh yes yes but I hardly  I think it is an extremely farfetched supposition.",
    "You had also I believe a disappearance here of a foreign girl.",
    "Her name I believe was Olga or Sonia  I am not\nsure of the surname.",
    "Olga Seminoff.",
    "Yes indeed.",
    "Not I fear a very reliable character\nNo.",
    "She was companion or nurse attendant to Mrs LlewellynSmythe was she not whom you described to me just\nnow Mrs Drakes aunt \nYes.",
    "She had had several girls in that position  two other foreign girls I think one of them with whom she\nquarrelled almost immediately and another one who was nice but painfully stupid.",
    "Mrs LlewellynSmythe was not\none to suffer fools gladly.",
    "Olga her last venture seems to have suited her very well.",
    "She was not if I remember\nrightly a particularly attractive girl said Mr Fullerton.",
    "She was short rather stocky had rather a dour manner and people in the neighbourhood did not like her very\nmuch.",
    "But Mrs LlewellynSmythe did like her suggested Poirot.",
    "She became very much attached to her  unwisely so it\nseemed at one moment.",
    "Ah indeed.",
    "I have no doubt said Mr Fullerton that I am not telling you anything that you have not heard already.",
    "These\nthings as I say go round the place like wildfire.",
    "I understand that Mrs LlewellynSmythe left a large sum of money to the girl.",
    "A most surprising thing to happen said Mr Fullerton.",
    "Mrs LlewellynSmythe had not changed her fundamental\n\n\ftestamentary disposition for many years except for adding new charities or altering legacies left void by death.",
    "Perhaps I am telling you what you know already if you are interested in this matter.",
    "Her money had always been left\njointly to her nephew Hugo Drake and his wife who was also his first cousin and so also niece to Mrs LlewellynSmythe.",
    "If either of them predeceased her the money went to the survivor.",
    "A good many bequests were left to\ncharities and to old servants.",
    "But what was alleged to be her final disposal of her property was made about three\nweeks before her death and not as heretofore drawn up by our firm.",
    "It was a codicil written in her own\nhandwriting.",
    "It included one or two charities  not so many as before  the old servants had no legacies at all and the\nwhole residue of her considerable fortune was left to Olga Seminoff in gratitude for the devoted service and\naffection she had shown her.",
    "A most astonishing disposition one that seemed totally unlike anything Mrs\nLlewellynSmythe had ever done before.",
    "And then said Poirot.",
    "You have presumably heard more or less the developments.",
    "From the evidence of handwriting experts it became\nclear that the codicil was a complete forgery.",
    "It bore only a faint resemblance to Mrs LlewellynSmythes\nhandwriting no more than that.",
    "Mrs Smythe had disliked the typewriter and had frequently got Olga to write letters\nof a personal nature as far as possible copying her employers handwriting  sometimes even signing the letter with\nher employers signature.",
    "She had had plenty of practice in doing this.",
    "It seems that when Mrs LlewellynSmythe\ndied the girl went one step further and thought that she was proficient enough to make the handwriting acceptable as\nthat of her employer.",
    "But that sort of thing wont do with experts.",
    "No indeed it wont.",
    "Proceedings were about to be taken to contest the document\nQuite so.",
    "There was of course the usual legal delay before the proceedings actually came to court.",
    "During that\nperiod the young lady lost her nerve and  well as you said yourself just now she disappeared.",
    "Chapter 13\nWhen Hercule Poirot had taken his leave and departed Jeremy Fullerton sat before his desk drumming gently with\nhis fingertips.",
    "His eyes however were far away lost in thought.",
    "He picked up a document in front of him and dropped his eyes down to it but without focusing his glance.",
    "The\ndiscreet buzz of the house telephone caused him to pick up the receiver on his desk.",
    "Yes Miss Miles\nMr Holden is here sir.",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes his appointment I believe was for nearly three quarters of an hour ago.",
    "Did he give any reason for\nhaving been so late...",
    "Yes yes I quite see.",
    "Rather the same excuse he gave last time.",
    "Will you tell him Ive seen\nanother client and I am now too short of time.",
    "Make an appointment with him for next week will you We cant\nhave this sort of thing going on.",
    "Yes Mr Fullerton.",
    "He replaced the receiver and sat looking thoughtfully down at the document in front of him.",
    "He was still not reading\nit.",
    "His mind was going over events of the past.",
    "Two years  close on two years ago  and that strange little man this\nmorning with his patent leather shoes and his big moustaches had brought it back to him asking all those questions.",
    "Now he was going over in his own mind a conversation of nearly two years ago.",
    "He saw again sitting in the chair\nopposite him a girl a short stocky figure the olive brown skin the dark red generous mouth the heavy cheekbones\nand the fierceness of the blue eyes that looked into his beneath the heavy beetling brows.",
    "A passionate face a face\nfull of vitality a face that had known suffering  would probably always know suffering  but would never learn to\naccept suffering.",
    "The kind of woman who would fight and protest until the end.",
    "Where was she now he wondered\nSomehow or other she had managed  what had she managed exactly Who had helped her Had anyone helped her\nSomebody must have done so.",
    "She was back again he supposed in some troublestricken spot in Central Europe where she had come from where\nshe belonged where she had had to go back to because there was no other course for her to take unless she was\ncontent to lose her liberty.",
    "Jeremy Fullerton was an upholder of the law.",
    "He believed in the law he was contemptuous of many of the\nmagistrates of today with their weak sentences their acceptance of scholastic needs.",
    "The students who stole books\nthe young married women who denuded the supermarkets the girls who filched money from their employers the\nboys who wrecked telephone boxes none of them in real need none of them desperate most of them had known\nnothing but overindulgence in bringingup and a fervent belief that anything they could not afford to buy was theirs\nto take.",
    "Yet along with his intrinsic belief in the administration of the law justly Mr Fullerton was a man who had\ncompassion.",
    "He could be sorry for people.",
    "He could be sorry and was sorry for Olga Seminoff though he was quite\nunaffected by the passionate arguments she advanced for herself.",
    "I came to you for help.",
    "I thought you would help me.",
    "You were kind last year.",
    "You helped me with forms so that I\ncould remain another year in England.",
    "So they say to me You need not answer any questions you do not wish to.",
    "You can be represented by a lawyer.",
    "So I come to you.",
    "The circumstances you have instanced  and Mr Fullerton remembered how dryly and coldly he had said that all\nthe more dryly and coldly because of the pity that lay behind the dryness of the statement  do not apply.",
    "In this\ncase I am not at liberty to act for you legally.",
    "I am representing already the Drake family.",
    "As you know I was Mrs\nLlewellynSmythes solicitor.",
    "But she is dead.",
    "She does not want a solicitor when she is dead.",
    "She was fond of you said Mr Fullerton.",
    "Yes she was fond of me.",
    "That is what I am telling you.",
    "That is why she wanted to give me the money.",
    "All her money\nWhy not Why not She did not like her relations.",
    "You are wrong.",
    "She was very fond of her niece and nephew.",
    "Well then she may have liked Mr Drake but she did not like Mrs Drake.",
    "She found her very tiresome.",
    "Mrs Drake\ninterfered.",
    "She would not let Mrs LlewellynSmythe do always what she liked.",
    "She would not let her eat the food she\nliked.",
    "She is a very conscientious woman and she tried to get her aunt to obey the doctors orders as to diet and not too\nmuch exercise and many other things.",
    "People do not always want to obey a doctors orders.",
    "They do not want to be interfered with by relations.",
    "They like\nliving their own lives and doing what they want and having what they want.",
    "She had plenty of money.",
    "She could\nhave what she wanted She could have as much as she liked of everything.",
    "She was rich rich rich and she could do\nwhat she liked with her money.",
    "They have already quite enough money Mr and Mrs Drake.",
    "They have a fine house\nand clothes and two cars.",
    "They are very welltodo.",
    "Why should they have any more\nThey were her only living relations.",
    "She wanted me to have the money.",
    "She was sorry for me.",
    "She knew what I had been through.",
    "She knew about my\nfather arrested by the police and taken away.",
    "We never saw him again my mother and I.",
    "And then my mother and\nhow she died.",
    "All my family died.",
    "It is terrible what I have endured.",
    "You do not know what it is like to live in a\npolice state as I have lived in it.",
    "No no.",
    "You are on the side of the police.",
    "You are not on my side.",
    "No Mr Fullerton said I am not on your side.",
    "I am very sorry for what has happened to you but youve brought\nthis trouble about yourself.",
    "That is not true It is not true that I have done anything I should not do.",
    "What have I done I was kind to her I was\n\n\fnice to her.",
    "I brought her in lots of things that she was not supposed to eat.",
    "Chocolates and butter.",
    "All the time\nnothing but vegetable fats.",
    "She did not like vegetable fats.",
    "She wanted butter.",
    "She wanted lots of butter.",
    "Its not just a question of butter said Mr Fullerton.",
    "I looked after her I was nice to her And so she was grateful.",
    "And then when she died and I find that in her\nkindness and her affection she has left a signed paper leaving all her money to me then those Drakes come along\nand say I shall not have it.",
    "They say all sorts of things.",
    "They say I had a bad influence.",
    "And then they say worse\nthings than that.",
    "Much worse.",
    "They say I wrote the Will myself.",
    "That is nonsense.",
    "She wrote it.",
    "She wrote it.",
    "And\nthen she sent me out of the room.",
    "She got the cleaning woman and Jim the gardener.",
    "She said they had to sign the\npaper not me.",
    "Because I was going to get the money.",
    "Why should not I have the money Why should I not have\nsome good luck in my life some happiness It seemed so wonderful.",
    "All the things I planned to do when I knew\nabout it.",
    "I have no doubt yes I have no doubt.",
    "Why shouldnt I have plans Why should not I rejoice I am going to be happy and rich and have all the things I\nwant.",
    "What did I do wrong Nothing.",
    "Nothing I tell you.",
    "Nothing\nI have tried to explain to you said Mr Fullerton.",
    "That is all lies.",
    "You say I tell lies.",
    "You say I wrote the paper myself.",
    "I did not write it myself.",
    "She wrote it.",
    "Nobody\ncan say anything different.",
    "Certain people say a good many things said Mr Fullerton.",
    "Now listen.",
    "Stop protesting and listen to me.",
    "It is true\nis it not that Mrs LlewellynSmythe in the letters you wrote for her often asked you to copy her handwriting as\nnearly as you could That was because she had an oldfashioned idea that to write typewritten letters to people who\nare friends or with whom you have a personal acquaintance is an act of rudeness.",
    "That is a survival from Victorian\ndays.",
    "Nowadays nobody cares whether they receive handwritten letters or typewritten ones.",
    "But to Mrs LlewellynSmythe that was discourtesy.",
    "You understand what I am saying\nYes I understand.",
    "And so she asks me.",
    "She says Now Olga she says.",
    "These four letters you will answer as I have\ntold you and that you have taken down in shorthand.",
    "But you will write them in handwriting and you will make the\nhandwriting as close to mine as possible.",
    "And she told me to practise writing her handwriting to notice how she\nmade her as her bs and her fs and all the different letters.",
    "So long as it is reasonably like my handwriting she\nsaid\nthat will do and then you can sign my name.",
    "But I do not want people to think that I am no longer able to write my\nown letters.",
    "Although as you know the rheumatism in my wrist is getting worse and I find it more difficult but I\ndont want my personal letters typewritten.",
    "You could have written them in your ordinary handwriting said Mr Fullerton\nand put a note at the end saying per secretary or per initials if you liked.",
    "She did not want me to do that.",
    "She wanted it to be thought that she wrote the letters herself.",
    "And that Mr Fullerton thought could be true enough.",
    "It was very like Louise LlewellynSmythe.",
    "She was always\npassionately resentful of the fact that she could no longer do the things she used to do that she could no longer walk\nfar or go up hills quickly or perform certain actions with her hands her right hand especially.",
    "She wanted to be able\nto say Im perfectly well perfectly all right and theres nothing I cant do if I set my mind to it.",
    "Yes what Olga\nwas telling him now was certainly true and because it was true it was one of the reasons why the codicil appended\nto the last Will properly drawn out and signed by Louise LlewellynSmythe had been accepted at first without\nsuspicion.",
    "It was in his own office Mr Fullerton reflected that suspicions had arisen because both he and his\nyounger partner knew Mrs LlewellynSmythes handwriting very well.",
    "It was young Cole who had first said You\nknow I really cant believe that Louise LlewellynSmythe wrote that codicil.",
    "I know she had arthritis lately but look\nat these specimens of her own writing that Ive brought along from amongst her papers to show you.",
    "Theres\nsomething wrong about that codicil.",
    "Mr Fullerton had agreed that there was something wrong about it.",
    "He had said they would take expert opinion on\nthis handwriting question.",
    "The answer had been quite definite.",
    "Separate opinions had not varied.",
    "The handwriting of\nthe codicil was definitely not that of Louise LlewellynSmythe.",
    "If Olga had been less greedy Mr Fullerton thought\nif she had been content to write a codicil beginning as this one had done.",
    "Because of her great care and attention to\nme and the affection and kindness she has shown me I leave  That was how it had begun that was how it could\nhave begun and if it had gone on to specify a good round sum of money left to the devoted au pair girl the relations\nmight have considered it overdone but they would have accepted it without questioning.",
    "But to cut out the relations\naltogether the nephew who had been his aunts residuary legatee in the last four wills she had made during a period\nof nearly twenty years to leave everything to the stranger Olga Seminoff  that was not in Louise LlewellynSmythes character.",
    "In fact a plea of undue influence could upset such a document anyway.",
    "No.",
    "She had been greedy this hot\npassionate child.",
    "Possibly Mrs LlewellynSmythe had told her that some money would be left her because of her\nkindness because of her attention because of a fondness the old lady was beginning to feel for this girl who fulfilled\nall her whims who did whatever she asked her.",
    "And that had opened up a vista for Olga.",
    "She would have\neverything.",
    "The old lady should leave everything to her and she would have all the money.",
    "All the money and the house and the\nclothes and the jewels.",
    "Everything.",
    "A greedy girl.",
    "And now retribution had caught up with her.",
    "And Mr Fullerton against his will against his legal instincts and against a good deal more felt sorry for her.",
    "Very\nsorry for her.",
    "She had known suffering since she was a child had known the rigours of a police state had lost her\nparents lost a brother and sister and known injustice and fear and it had developed in her a trait that she had no\ndoubt been born with but which she had never been able so far to indulge.",
    "It had developed a childish passionate\ngreed.",
    "Everyone is against me said Olga.",
    "Everyone.",
    "You are all against me.",
    "You are not fair because I am a foreigner\nbecause I do not belong to this country because I do not know what to say what to do.",
    "What can I do Why do you\nnot tell me what I can do\nBecause I do not really think there is anything much you can do said Mr Fullerton.",
    "Your best chance is to make a\nclean breast of things.",
    "If I say what you want me to say it will be all lies and not true.",
    "She made that Will.",
    "She wrote it down there.",
    "She\ntold me to go out of the room while the others signed it.",
    "There is evidence against you you know.",
    "There are people who will say that Mrs LlewellynSmythe often did not\nknow what she was signing.",
    "She had several documents of different kinds and she did not always reread what was\nput before her.",
    "Well then she did not know what she was saying.",
    "My dear child said Mr Fullerton your best hope is the fact that you are a first offender that you are a foreigner\nthat you understand the English language only in a rather rudimentary form.",
    "In that case you may get off with a\nminor sentence or you may indeed get put on probation.",
    "Oh words.",
    "Nothing but words.",
    "I shall be put in prison and never let out again.",
    "Now you are talking nonsense Mr Fullerton said.",
    "It would be better if I ran away if I ran away and hid myself so that nobody could find me.",
    "Once there is a warrant out for your arrest you would be found.",
    "Not if I did it quickly.",
    "Not if I went at once.",
    "Not if someone helped me.",
    "I could get away.",
    "Get away from England.",
    "In a boat or a plane.",
    "I could find someone who forges passports or visas or whatever you have to have.",
    "Someone\nwho will do something for me.",
    "I have friends.",
    "I have people who are fond of me.",
    "Somebody could help me to\ndisappear.",
    "That is what is needed.",
    "I could put on a wig.",
    "I could walk about on crutches.",
    "Listen Mr Fullerton had said and he had spoken then with authority I am sorry for you.",
    "I will recommend you\nto a lawyer who will do his best for you.",
    "You cant hope to disappear.",
    "You are talking like a child.",
    "I have got enough money.",
    "I have saved money.",
    "And then she had said You have tried to be kind.",
    "Yes I believe\nthat.",
    "But you will not do anything because it is all the law  the law.",
    "But someone will help me.",
    "Someone will.",
    "And I\nshall get away where nobody will ever find me.",
    "Nobody Mr Fullerton thought had found her.",
    "He wondered yes he wondered very much where she was or could be\nnow.",
    "Chapter 14\nAdmitted to Apple Trees Hercule Poirot was shown into the drawingroom and told that Mrs Drake would not be\nlong.",
    "In passing through the hall he heard a hum of female voices from behind what he took to be the diningroom door.",
    "Poirot crossed to the drawingroom window and surveyed the neat and pleasant garden.",
    "Well laid out kept\nstudiously in control.",
    "Rampant autumn michaelmas daisies still survived tied up severely to sticks chrysanthemums\nhad not yet relinquished life.",
    "There were still a persistent rose or two scorning the approach of winter.",
    "Poirot could discern no sign as yet of the preliminary activities of a landscape gardener.",
    "All was care and\nconvention.",
    "He wondered if Mrs Drake had been one too many for Michael Garfield.",
    "He had spread his lures in\nvain.",
    "It showed every sign of remaining a splendidly kept suburban garden.",
    "The door opened.",
    "I am sorry to have kept you waiting Monsieur Poirot said Mrs Drake.",
    "Outside in the hall there was a diminishing\nhum of voices as various people took their leave and departed.",
    "Its our church Christmas f\u00eate explained Mrs Drake.",
    "A Committee Meeting for arrangements for it and all the\nrest of it.",
    "These things always go on much longer than they ought to of course.",
    "Somebody always objects to\nsomething or has a good idea  the good idea usually being a perfectly impossible one.",
    "There was a slight acerbity\nin her tone.",
    "Poirot could well imagine that Rowena Drake would put things down as quite absurd firmly and definitely.",
    "He\ncould understand well enough from remarks he had heard from Spences sister from hints of what other people had\nsaid and from various other sources that Rowena Drake was that dominant type of personality whom everyone\nexpects to run the show and whom nobody has much affection for while she is doing it.",
    "He could imagine too that\nher conscientiousness had not been the kind to be appreciated by an elderly relative who was herself of the same\ntype.",
    "Mrs LlewellynSmythe he gathered had come here to live so as to be near to her nephew and his wife and\nthat the wife had readily undertaken the supervision and care of her husbands aunt as far as she could do so without\nactually living in the house.",
    "Mrs LlewellynSmythe had probably acknowledged in her own mind that she owed a\ngreat deal to Rowena and had at the same time resented what she had no doubt thought of as her bossy ways.",
    "Well theyve all gone now said Rowena Drake hearing the final shutting of the hall door.",
    "Now what can I do for\nyou Something more about that dreadful party I wish Id never had it here.",
    "But no other house really seemed\nsuitable.",
    "Is Mrs Oliver still staying with Judith Butler\nYes.",
    "She is I believe returning to London in a day or two.",
    "You had not met her before\nNo.",
    "I love her books.",
    "She is I believe considered a very good writer said Poirot.",
    "Oh well she is a good writer.",
    "No doubt of that.",
    "Shes a very amusing person too.",
    "Has she any ideas herself  I mean\nabout who might have done this awful thing\n\n\fI think not.",
    "And you Madame\nI told you already.",
    "Ive no idea whatever.",
    "You would perhaps say so and yet  you might might you not have perhaps what amounts to a very good idea\nbut only an idea.",
    "A halfformed idea.",
    "A possible idea.",
    "Why should you think that\nShe looked at him curiously.",
    "You might have seen something  something quite small and unimportant but which on reflection might seem more\nsignificant to you perhaps than it had done at first.",
    "You must have something in your mind Monsieur Poirot some definite incident.",
    "Well I admit it.",
    "It is because of what someone said to me.",
    "Indeed And who was that\nA Miss Whittaker.",
    "A schoolteacher.",
    "Oh yes of course.",
    "Elizabeth Whittaker.",
    "Shes the mathematics mistress isnt she at The Elms She was at the\nparty I remember.",
    "Did she see something\nIt was not so much that she saw something as she had the idea that you might have seen something.",
    "Mrs Drake looked surprised and shook her head.",
    "I cant think of anything I can possibly have seen said Rowena Drake but one never knows.",
    "It had to do with a vase said Poirot.",
    "A vase of flowers.",
    "A vase of flowers Rowena Drake looked puzzled.",
    "Then her brow cleared.",
    "Oh of course.",
    "I know.",
    "Yes there was\na big vase of autumn leaves and chrysanthemums on the table in the angle of the stairs.",
    "A very nice glass vase.",
    "One\nof my wedding presents.",
    "The leaves seemed to be drooping and so did one or two of the flowers.",
    "I remember\nnoticing it as I passed through the hall  it was near the end of the party I think by then but Im not sure  I\nwondered why it looked like that and I went up and dipped my fingers into it and found that some idiot must have\nforgotten to put any water into it after arranging it.",
    "It made me very angry.",
    "So I took it into the bathroom and filled it\nup.",
    "But what could I have seen in that bathroom There was nobody in it.",
    "I am quite sure of that.",
    "I think one or two\nof the older girls and boys had done a little harmless what the Americans call\nnecking  there during the course of the party but there was certainly nobody when I went into it with the vase.",
    "No no I do not mean that said Poirot.",
    "But I understood that there was an accident.",
    "That the vase slipped out of\nyour hand and it fell to the hall below and was shattered to pieces.",
    "Oh yes said Rowena.",
    "Broken to smithereens.",
    "I was rather upset about it because as Ive said it had been one of\nour wedding presents and it was really a perfect flower vase heavy enough to hold big autumn bouquets and things\nlike that.",
    "It was very stupid of me.",
    "One of those things.",
    "My fingers just slipped.",
    "It went out of my hand and crashed\non the hall floor below.",
    "Elizabeth Whittaker was standing there.",
    "She helped me pick up the pieces and sweep some\nof the broken glass out of the way in case someone stepped on it.",
    "We just swept it into a corner by the Grandfather\nclock to be cleared up later.",
    "She looked inquiringly at Poirot.",
    "Is that the incident you mean she asked.",
    "Yes said Poirot.",
    "Miss Whittaker wondered I think how you had come to drop the vase.",
    "She thought that\nsomething perhaps had startled you.",
    "Startled me Rowena Drake looked at him then frowned as she tried to think again.",
    "No I dont think I was\nstartled anyway.",
    "It was just one of those ways things do slip out of your hands.",
    "Sometimes when youre washing up.",
    "I think really its a result of being tired.",
    "I was pretty tired by that time what with the preparations for the party and\nrunning the party and all the rest of it.",
    "It went very well I must say.",
    "I think it was  oh just one of those clumsy\nactions that you cant help when youre tired.",
    "There was nothing  you are sure  that startled you Something unexpected that you saw.",
    "Saw Where In the hall below I didnt see anything in the hall below.",
    "It was empty at the moment because\neveryone was in at the Snapdragon excepting of course for Miss Whittaker.",
    "And I dont think I even noticed her\nuntil she came forward to help when I ran down.",
    "Did you see someone perhaps leaving the library door\nThe library door...",
    "I see what you mean.",
    "Yes I could have seen that.",
    "She paused for quite a long time then she\nlooked at Poirot with a very straight firm glance.",
    "I didnt see anyone leave the library she said.",
    "Nobody at all...",
    "He wondered.",
    "The way in which she said it was\nwhat aroused the belief in his mind that she was not speaking the truth that instead she had seen someone or\nsomething perhaps the door just opening a little a mere glance perhaps of a figure inside.",
    "But she was quite firm in\nher denial.",
    "Why he wondered had she been so firm Because the person she had seen was a person she did not want\nto believe for one moment had had anything to do with the crime committed on the other side of the door Someone\nshe cared about or someone  which seemed more likely he thought  someone whom she wished to protect.",
    "Someone perhaps who had not long passed beyond childhood someone whom she might feel was not truly\nconscious of the awful thing they had just done.",
    "He thought her a hard creature but a person of integrity.",
    "He thought that she was like many women of the same\ntype women who were often magistrates or who ran councils or charities or interested themselves in what used to\nbe called\ngood works.",
    "Women who had an inordinate belief in extenuating circumstances who were ready strangely\nenough to make excuses for the young criminal.",
    "An adolescent boy a mentally retarded girl.",
    "Someone perhaps who had already been  what is the phrase  in care.",
    "If that had been the type of person she had\nseen coming out of the library then he thought it possible that Rowena Drakes protective instinct might have come\ninto play.",
    "It was not unknown in the present age for children to commit crimes quite young children.",
    "Children of seven of nine and so on and it was often difficult to know how to dispose of these natural it seemed\nyoung criminals who came before the juvenile courts.",
    "Excuses had to be brought for them.",
    "Broken homes.",
    "Negligent\nand unsuitable parents.",
    "But the people who spoke the most vehemently for them the people who sought to bring\nforth every excuse for them were usually the type of Rowena Drake.",
    "A stern and censorious woman except in such\ncases.",
    "For himself Poirot did not agree.",
    "He was a man who thought first always of justice.",
    "He was suspicious had\nalways been suspicious of mercy  too much mercy that is to say.",
    "Too much mercy as he knew from former\nexperience both in Belgium and this country often resulted in further crimes which were fatal to innocent victims\nwho need not have been victims if justice had been put first and mercy second.",
    "I see said Poirot.",
    "I see.",
    "You dont think its possible that Miss Whittaker might have seen someone go into the library suggested Mrs\nDrake.",
    "Poirot was interested.",
    "Ah you think that that might have been so\nIt seemed to me merely a possibility.",
    "She might have caught sight of someone going in through the library say\nperhaps five minutes or so earlier and then when I dropped the vase it might have suggested to her that I could have\ncaught a glimpse of the same person.",
    "That I might have seen who it was.",
    "Perhaps she doesnt like to say anything\n\n\fthat might suggest unfairly perhaps some person whom she had perhaps only half glimpsed not enough to be sure\nof.",
    "Some back view perhaps of a child or a young boy.",
    "You think do you not Madame that it was shall we say a child a boy or girl a mere child or a young adolescent\nYou think it was not any definite one of these but shall we say you think that that is the most likely type to have\ncommitted the crime we are discussing\nShe considered the point thoughtfully turning it over in her mind.",
    "Yes she said at last I suppose I do.",
    "I havent thought it out.",
    "It seems to me that crimes are so often associated\nnowadays with the young.",
    "People who dont really know quite what they are doing who want silly revenges who\nhave an instinct for destruction.",
    "Even the people who wreck telephone boxes or who slash the tyres of cars do all\nsorts of things just to hurt people just because they hate  not anyone in particular but the whole world.",
    "Its a sort of\nsymptom of this age.",
    "So I suppose when one comes across something like a child drowned at a party for no reason\nreally one does assume that its someone who is not yet fully responsible for their actions.",
    "Dont you agree with me\nthat\n that  well that that is certainly the most likely possibility here\nThe police I think share your point of view  or did share it.",
    "Well they should know.",
    "We have a very good class of policeman in this district.",
    "Theyve done well in several\ncrimes.",
    "They are painstaking and they never give up.",
    "I think probably they will solve this murder though I dont\nthink it will happen very quickly.",
    "These things seem to take a long time.",
    "A long time of patient gathering of\nevidence.",
    "The evidence in this case will not be very easy to gather Madame.",
    "No I suppose it wont.",
    "When my husband was killed  He was a cripple you know.",
    "He was crossing the road and a\ncar ran over him and knocked him down.",
    "They never found the person who was responsible.",
    "As you know my\nhusband  or perhaps you dont know  my husband was a polio victim.",
    "He was partially paralysed as a result of\npolio six years ago.",
    "His condition had improved but he was still crippled and it would be difficult for him to get\nout of the way if a car bore down upon him quickly.",
    "I almost felt that I had been to blame though he always insisted\non going out without me or without anyone with him because he would have resented very much being in the care\nof a nurse or a wife who took the part of a nurse and he was always careful before crossing a road.",
    "Still one does\nblame oneself when accidents happen.",
    "That came on top of the death of your aunt\nNo.",
    "She died not long afterwards.",
    "Everything seems to come at once doesnt it\nThat is very true said Hercule Poirot.",
    "He went on The police were not able to trace the car that ran down your\nhusband\nIt was a Grasshopper Mark 7 I believe.",
    "Every third car you notice on the road is a Grasshopper Mark 7  or was\nthen.",
    "Its the most popular car on the market they tell me.",
    "They believe it was pinched from the Market Place in\nMedchester.",
    "A car park there.",
    "It belonged to a Mr Waterhouse an elderly seed merchant in Medchester.",
    "Mr\nWaterhouse was a slow and careful driver.",
    "It was certainly not he who caused the accident.",
    "It was clearly one of\nthose cases where irresponsible young men help themselves to cars.",
    "Such careless or should I say such callous\nyoung men should be treated one sometimes feels more severely than they are now.",
    "A long gaol sentence perhaps.",
    "Merely to be fined and the fine paid by indulgent relatives makes little\nimpression.",
    "One has to remember said Rowena Drake that there are young people at an age when it is vital that they should\ncontinue with their studies if they are to have the chance of doing well in life.",
    "The sacred cow of education said Hercule Poirot.",
    "That is a phrase I have heard uttered he added quickly by people  well should I say  people who ought to\nknow.",
    "People who themselves hold academic posts of some seniority.",
    "They do not perhaps make enough allowances for youth for a bad bringing up.",
    "Broken homes.",
    "So you think they need something other than gaol sentences\nProper remedial treatment said Rowena Drake firmly.",
    "And that will make another oldfashioned proverb a silk purse out of a sows ear You do not believe in the\nmaxim the fate of every man have we bound about his neck\nMrs Drake looked extremely doubtful and slightly displeased.",
    "An Islamic saying I believe said Poirot.",
    "Mrs Drake looked unimpressed.",
    "I hope she said we do not take our ideas  or perhaps I should say our ideals  from the Middle East.",
    "One must accept facts said Poirot and a fact that is expressed by modern biologists  Western biologists he\nhastened to add seems to suggest very strongly that the root of a persons actions lies in his genetic makeup.",
    "That\na murderer of twentyfour was a murderer in potential at two or three or four years old.",
    "Or of course a\nmathematician or a musical genius.",
    "We are not discussing murderers said Mrs Drake.",
    "My husband died as a result of an accident.",
    "An accident\ncaused by a careless and badly adjusted personality.",
    "Whoever the boy or young man was there is always the hope of\neventual adjustment to a belief and acceptance that it is a duty to consider others to feel an abhorrence if you have\ntaken life unawares simply out of what may be described as criminal carelessness that was not really criminal in\nintent.",
    "You are quite sure therefore that it was not criminal intent\nI should doubt it very much.",
    "Mrs Drake looked slightly surprised.",
    "I do not think that the police ever seriously considered that possibility.",
    "I certainly did not.",
    "It was an accident.",
    "A\nvery tragic accident which altered the pattern of many lives including my own.",
    "You say were not discussing murderers said Poirot.",
    "But in the case of Joyce that is just what we are discussing.",
    "There was no accident about that.",
    "Deliberate hands pushed that childs head down into water holding her there till\ndeath occurred.",
    "Deliberate intent.",
    "I know.",
    "I know.",
    "Its terrible.",
    "I dont like to think of it to be reminded of it.",
    "She got up moving about restlessly.",
    "Poirot pushed on relentlessly.",
    "We are still presented with a choice there.",
    "We still have to find the motive involved.",
    "It seems to me that such a crime must have been quite motiveless.",
    "You mean committed by someone mentally disturbed to the extent of enjoying killing someone Presumably killing\nsomeone young and immature.",
    "One does hear of such cases.",
    "What is the original cause of them is difficult to find out.",
    "Even psychiatrists do not\nagree.",
    "You refuse to accept a simpler explanation\n\n\fShe looked puzzled.",
    "Simpler\nSomeone not mentally disturbed not a possible case for psychiatrists to disagree over.",
    "Somebody perhaps who just\nwanted to be safe.",
    "Safe Oh you mean \nThe girl had boasted that same day some hours previously that she had seen someone commit a murder.",
    "Joyce said Mrs Drake with calm certainty was really a very silly little girl.",
    "Not I am afraid always very\ntruthful.",
    "So everyone has told me said Hercule Poirot.",
    "I am beginning to believe you know that what everybody has told\nme must be right he added with a sigh.",
    "It usually is.",
    "He rose to his feet adopting a different manner.",
    "I must apologise Madame.",
    "I have talked of painful things to you things that do not truly concern me here.",
    "But it\nseemed from what Miss Whittaker told me \nWhy dont you find out more from her\nYou mean \nShe is a teacher.",
    "She knows much better than I can what potentialities as you have called them exist amongst the\nchildren she teached.",
    "She paused and then said Miss Emlyn too.",
    "The headmistress Poirot looked surprised.",
    "Yes.",
    "She knows things.",
    "I mean she is a natural psychologist.",
    "You said I might have ideas  halfformed ones  as to\nwho killed Joyce.",
    "I havent  but I think Miss Emlyn might.",
    "This is interesting...",
    "I dont mean she has evidence.",
    "I mean she just knows.",
    "She could tell you  but I dont think she will.",
    "I begin to see said Poirot that I have still a long way to go.",
    "People know things  but they will not tell them to\nme.",
    "He looked thoughtfully at Rowena Drake.",
    "Your aunt Mrs LlewellynSmythe had an au pair girl who looked after her a foreign girl.",
    "You seem to have got hold of all the local gossip.",
    "Rowena spoke dryly.",
    "Yes that is so.",
    "She left here rather\nsuddenly soon after my aunts death.",
    "For good reasons it would seem.",
    "I dont know whether its libel or slander to say so  but there seems no doubt that she forged a codicil to my aunts\nWill  or that someone helped her to do so.",
    "Someone\nShe was friendly with a young man who worked in a solicitors office in Medchester.",
    "He had been mixed up in a\nforgery case before.",
    "The case never came to court because the girl disappeared.",
    "She realised the Will would not be\nadmitted to probate and that there was going to be a court case.",
    "She left the neighbourhood and has never been\nheard of since.",
    "She too came I have heard from a broken home said Poirot.",
    "Rowena Drake looked at him sharply but he was\nsmiling amiably.",
    "Thank you for all you have told me Madame he said.",
    "When Poirot had left the house he went for a short walk\nalong a turning off the main road which was labelled Helpsly Cemetery Road.",
    "The cemetery in question did not\ntake him long to reach.",
    "It was at most ten minutes walk.",
    "It was obviously a cemetery that had been made in the last\nten years presumably to cope with the rising importance of Woodleigh as a residential entity.",
    "The church a church\nof reasonable size dating from some two or three centuries back had had a very small enclosure round it already\nwell filled.",
    "So the new cemetery had come into being with a footpath connecting it across two fields.",
    "It was Poirot\nthought a businesslike modern cemetery with appropriate sentiments on marble or granite slabs it had urns\nchippings small plantations of bushes or flowers.",
    "No interesting old epitaphs or inscriptions.",
    "Nothing much for an\nantiquarian.",
    "Cleaned neat tidy and with suitable sentiments expressed.",
    "He came to a halt to read a tablet erected on\na grave contemporary with several others near it all dating within two or three years back.",
    "It bore a simple\ninscription Sacred to the Memory of Hugo Edmund Drake beloved husband of Rowena Arabella Drake who\ndeparted this life March the 20th 19 He giveth his beloved sleep.",
    "It occurred to Poirot fresh from the impact of the dynamic Rowena Drake that perhaps sleep might have come in\nwelcome guise to the late Mr Drake.",
    "An alabaster urn had been fixed in position there and contained the remains of\nflowers.",
    "An elderly gardener obviously employed to tend the graves of good citizens departed this life approached\nPoirot in the pleasurable hopes of a few minutes conversation while he laid his hoe and his broom aside.",
    "Stranger in these parts I think he said arent you sir\nIt is very true said Poirot.",
    "I am a stranger with you as were my fathers before me.",
    "Ah aye.",
    "Weve got that text somewhere or summat very like it.",
    "Over down the other corner it is.",
    "He went on He\nwas a nice gentleman he were Mr Drake.",
    "A cripple you know.",
    "He had that infant paralysis as they call it though\nas often as not it isnt infants as suffer from it.",
    "Its grownups.",
    "Men and women too.",
    "My wife she had an aunt who\ncaught it in Spain she did.",
    "Went there with a tour she did and bathed somewhere in some river.",
    "And they said\nafterwards as it was the water infection but I dont think they know much.",
    "Doctors dont if you ask me.",
    "Still its\nmade a lot of difference nowadays.",
    "All this inoculation they give the children and that.",
    "Not nearly as many cases as\nthere were.",
    "Yes he were a nice gentleman and didnt complain though he took it hard being a cripple I mean.",
    "Hed\nbeen a good sportsman he had in his time.",
    "Used to bat for us here in the village team.",
    "Many a six hes hit to the\nboundary.",
    "Yes he were a nice gentleman.",
    "He died of an accident did he not\nThats right.",
    "Crossing the road towards twilight this was.",
    "One of these cars come along a couple of these young\nthugs in it with beards growing up to their ears.",
    "Thats what they say.",
    "Didnt stop either.",
    "Went on.",
    "Never looked to\nsee.",
    "Abandoned the car somewhere in a car park twenty miles away.",
    "Wasnt their own car either.",
    "Pinched from a car\npark somewhere.",
    "Ah its terrible a lot of those accidents nowadays.",
    "And the police often cant do anything about\nthem.",
    "Very devoted to him his wife was.",
    "Took it very hard she did.",
    "She comes here nearly every week brings\nflowers and puts them here.",
    "Yes they were a very devoted couple.",
    "If you ask me she wont stay here much longer.",
    "Really But she has a very nice house here.",
    "Yes oh yes.",
    "And she does a lot in the village you know.",
    "All these things  womens institutes and teas and various\nsocieties and all the rest of it.",
    "Runs a lot of things she does.",
    "Runs a bit too many for some people.",
    "Bossy you know.",
    "Bossy and interfering some people say.",
    "But the vicar relies on her.",
    "She starts things.",
    "Womens activities and all the\nrest of it.",
    "Gets up tours and outings.",
    "Ah yes.",
    "Often thought myself though I wouldnt like to say it to my wife that\nall these good works as ladies does doesnt make you any fonder of the ladies themselves.",
    "Always know best they\ndo.",
    "Always telling you what you should do and what you shouldnt do.",
    "No freedom.",
    "Not much freedom anywhere\nnowadays.",
    "Yet you think Mrs Drake may leave here\nI shouldnt wonder if she didnt go away and live somewhere abroad.",
    "They liked being abroad used to go there for\n\n\fholidays.",
    "Why do you think she wants to leave here\nA sudden rather roguish smile appeared on the old mans face.",
    "Well Id say you know that shes done all she can do here.",
    "To put it scriptural she needs another vineyard to work\nin.",
    "She needs more good works.",
    "Arent no more good works to be done round here.",
    "Shes done all there is and even\nmore than there need be so some think.",
    "Yes.",
    "She needs a new field in which to labour suggested Poirot.",
    "Youve hit it.",
    "Better settle somewhere else where she can put a lot of things right and bully a lot of other people.",
    "Shes got us where she wants us here and theres not much more for her to do.",
    "It may be said Poirot.",
    "Hasnt even got her husband to look after.",
    "She looked after him a good few years.",
    "That gave her a kind of object in\nlife as you might say.",
    "What with that and a lot of outside activities she could be busy all the time.",
    "Shes the type\nlikes being busy all the time.",
    "And shes no children mores the pity.",
    "So its my view as shell start all over again\nsomewhere else.",
    "You may have something there.",
    "Where would she go\nI couldnt say as to that.",
    "One of these Riviery places maybe  or theres them as goes to Spain or Portugal.",
    "Or\nGreece  Ive heard her speak of Greece  Islands.",
    "Mrs Butler shes been to Greece on one of them tours.",
    "Hellenic\nthey call them which sounds more like fire and brimstone to me.",
    "Poirot smiled.",
    "The isles of Greece he murmured.",
    "Then he asked Do you like her\nMrs Drake I wouldnt say I exactly like her.",
    "Shes a good woman.",
    "Does her duty to her neighbour and all that  but\nshell always need a power of neighbours to do her duty to  and if you ask me nobody really likes people who are\nalways doing their duty.",
    "Tells me how to prune my roses which I know well enough myself.",
    "Always at me to grow\nsome newfangled kind of vegetable.",
    "Cabbage is good enough for me and Im sticking to cabbage.",
    "Poirot smiled.",
    "He said I must be on my way.",
    "Can you tell me where Nicholas Ransome and Desmond Holland\nlive\nPast the church third house on the left.",
    "They board with Mrs Brand go into Medchester Technical every day to\nstudy.",
    "Theyll be home by now.",
    "He gave Poirot an interested glance.",
    "So thats the way your mind is working is it Theres some already as thinks the same.",
    "No I think nothing as yet.",
    "But they were among those present  that is all.",
    "As he took leave and walked away he\nmused Among those present I have come nearly to the end of my list.",
    "Chapter 15\nTwo pairs of eyes looked at Poirot uneasily.",
    "I dont see what else we can tell you.",
    "Weve both been interviewed by the police M. Poirot.",
    "Poirot looked from one boy to the other.",
    "They would not have described themselves as boys their manner was carefully adult.",
    "So much so that if one shut ones eyes their conversation could have passed as that of elderly club men  Nicholas\n\n\fwas eighteen.",
    "Desmond was sixteen.",
    "To oblige a friend I make my inquiries of those present on a certain occasion.",
    "Not the Halloween party itself  the\npreparations for that party.",
    "You were both active in these.",
    "Yes we were.",
    "So far Poirot said I have interviewed cleaning women I have had the benefit of police views of talks to a doctor\n the doctor who examined the body first  have talked to a schoolteacher who was present to the headmistress of\nthe school to distraught relatives have heard much of the village gossip  By the way I understand you have a local\nwitch here\nThe two young men confronting him both laughed.",
    "You mean Mother Goodbody.",
    "Yes she came to the party and played the part of the witch.",
    "I have come now said Poirot to the younger generation to those of acute eyesight and acute hearing and who\nhave uptodate scientific knowledge and shrewd philosophy.",
    "I am eager  very eager  to hear your views on this\nmatter.",
    "Eighteen and sixteen he thought to himself looking at the two boys confronting him.",

    "The percentage of murders committed by this age group had been increasing in the last few years.",
    "Not that\nPoirot inclined to that particular suspicion himself but anything was possible.",
    "It was even possible that the killing\nwhich had occurred two or three years ago might have been committed by a boy youth or adolescent of fourteen or\ntwelve years of age.",
    "Such cases had occurred in recent newspaper reports.",
    "Keeping all these possibilities in mind he pushed them as it were behind a curtain for the moment and\nconcentrated instead on his own appraisement of these two their looks their clothes their manner their voices and\nso on and so forth in the Hercule Poirot manner masked behind a foreign shield of nattering words and much\nincreased foreign mannerisms so that they themselves should feel agreeably contemptuous of him though hiding\nthat under politeness and good manners.",

    "Seeing the things what have happened lately you never do know do you\nYou mean \nI mean what happened at the Halloween party or whatever they called it.",
    "I mean it shows you theres people who\narent dependable here doesnt it And it shows you things before that werent as you thought they were.",

    "Thats what Im meaning.",
    "Mrs LlewellynSmythe you see made one of these codcodicils and she\nleft all her money to the foreign girl what looked after her.",
    "And it was a surprise that because shed got relations\nliving here and shed come here anyway to live near them.",
    "She was very devoted to them Mr Drake in particular.",
    "And it struck people as pretty queer really.",
    "And then the lawyers you see they began saying things.",
    "They said as\nMrs LlewellynSmythe hadnt written that codicil at all.",
    "That the foreign pair girl had done it seeing as she got all\nthe money left to her.",
    "And they said as they were going to law about it.",
    "That Mrs Drake was going to counter set the\nWill if that is the right word.",
    "The lawyers were going to contest the Will.",
    "Yes I believe I did hear something about that said Mrs Oliver\nencouragingly.",

    "Mrs Leaman she thought was presumably an unreliable woman in some\nways a snooper perhaps a listener at doors.",
    "I didnt say nothing at the time said Mrs Leaman because you see I didnt rightly know.",
    "But you see I thought it\nwas queer and Ill admit to a lady like you who knows what these things are that I did want to know the truth about\n\n\fit.",
    "Id worked for Mrs LlewellynSmythe for some time I had and one wants to know how things happened.",
    "Quite said Mrs Oliver.",
    "If I thought Id done what I oughtnt to have done well of course Id have owned up to it.",
    "But I didnt think as Id\ndone anything really wrong you see.",
    "Not at the time if you understand she added.",
    "Oh yes said Mrs Oliver Im sure I shall understand.",
    "Go on.",
    "It was about this codicil.",
    "Yes you see one day Mrs LlewellynSmythe  she hadnt felt too good that day and so she asked us to come in.",
    "Me\nthat was and young Jim who helps down in the garden and brings the sticks in and the coals and things like that.",
    "So\nwe went into her room where she was and shed got papers before her there on the desk.",
    "And she turns to this\nforeign girl  Miss Olga we all called her  and said You go out of the room now dear because you mustnt be\nmixed up in this part of it or something like that.",
    "So Miss Olga she goes out of the room and Mrs LlewellynSmythe she tells us to come close and she says This is my Will this is.",
    "Shes got a bit of blotting paper over the top\npart of it but the bottom of its quite clear.",
    "She said Im writing something here on this piece of paper and I want you\nto be a witness of what Ive written and of my signature at the end of it.",
    "So she starts writing along the page.",
    "Scratchy pen she always used she wouldnt use Biros or anything like that.",
    "And she writes two or three lines of\nwriting and then she signed her name and then she says to me Now Mrs Leaman you write your name there.",
    "Your\nname and your address and then she says to Jim And now you write your name underneath there and your address\ntoo.",
    "There.",
    "Thatll do.",
    "Now youve seen me write that and youve seen my signature and youve written your names\nboth of you to say thats that.",
    "And then she says Thats all.",
    "Thank you very much.",
    "So we goes out of the room.",
    "Well I didnt think nothing more of it at the time but I wondered a bit.",
    "And it happened as I turns my head just as I\nwas going out of the room.",
    "You see the door doesnt always latch properly.",
    "You have to give it a pull to make it\nclick.",
    "And so I was doing that  I wasnt really looking if you know what I mean \nI know what you mean said Mrs Oliver in a noncommittal voice.",
    "And so I sees Mrs LlewellynSmythe pull herself up from the chair  shed got arthritis and had pain moving about\nsometimes  and go over to the bookcase and she pulled out a book and she puts that piece of paper shed just signed\n in an envelope it was  in one of the books.",
    "A big tall book it was in the bottom shelf.",
    "And she sticks it back in the\nbookcase.",
    "Well I never thought of it again as you might say.",
    "No really I didnt.",
    "But when all this fuss came up\nwell of course I felt  at least I  She came to a stop.",
    "Mrs Oliver had one of her useful intuitions.",
    "But surely she said you didnt wait as long as all that \nWell Ill tell you the truth I will.",
    "Ill admit I was curious.",
    "After all I mean you want to know when youve signed\nanything what youve signed dont you I mean its only human nature.",
    "Yes said Mrs Oliver its only human nature.",
    "Curiosity she thought was a highly component part in Mrs\nLeaman human nature.",
    "So I will admit that next day when Mrs LlewellynSmythe had driven into Medchester and I was doing her\nbedroom as usual  a bed sitting room she had because she had to rest a lot.",
    "And I thinks Well one ought really to\nknow when youve signed a thing what it is youve signed.",
    "I mean they always say with these hire purchase things\nyou should read the small print.",
    "Or in this case the handwriting suggested Mrs Oliver.",
    "So I thought well theres no harm  its not as though I was taking anything.",
    "I mean to say Id had to sign my name\nthere and I thought I really ought to know what Id signed.",
    "So I had a look along the bookshelves.",
    "They needed\ndusting anyway.",
    "And I found the one.",
    "It was on the bottom shelf.",
    "It was an old book a sort of Queen Victorias kind\nof book.",
    "And I found this envelope with a folded paper in it and the title of the book said Enquire Within upon\nEverything.",
    "And it seemed then as though it was sort of meant if you know what I mean\nYes said Mrs Oliver.",
    "It was clearly meant.",
    "And so you took out the paper and looked at it.",
    "Thats right.",
    "Madam.",
    "And whether I did wrong or not I dont know.",
    "But anyway there it was.",
    "It was a legal\n\n\fdocument all right.",
    "On the last page there was the writing what shed made the morning before.",
    "New writing with a\nnew scratchy pen she was using.",
    "It was clear enough to read though although she had a rather spiky handwriting.",
    "And what did it say said Mrs Oliver her curiosity now having joined itself to that previously felt by Mrs Leaman.",
    "Well it said something like as far as I remember  the exact words Im not quite sure of  something about a codicil\nand that after the legacies mentioned in her Will she bequeathed her entire fortune to Olga  Im not sure of the\nsurname it began with an S. Seminoff or something like that  in consideration of her great kindness and attention\nto her during her illness.",
    "And there it was written down and shed signed it and Id signed it and Jim had signed it.",
    "So I put it back where it was because I shouldnt like Mrs LlewellynSmythe to know that Id been poking about in\nher things.",
    "But well I said to myself well this is a surprise.",
    "And I thought fancy that foreign girl getting all that money\nbecause we all know as Mrs LlewellynSmythe was very rich.",
    "Her husband had been in shipbuilding and hed left\nher a big fortune and I thought well some people have all the luck.",
    "Mind you I wasnt particularly fond of Miss\nOlga myself.",
    "She had a sharp way with her sometimes and she had quite a bad temper.",
    "But I will say as she was\nalways very attentive and polite and all that to the old lady.",
    "Looking out for herself all right she was and she got\naway with it.",
    "And I thought well leaving all that money away from her own family.",
    "Then I thought well perhaps\nshes had a tiff with them and likely as not that will blow over so maybe shell tear this up and make another Will\nand codicil after all.",
    "But anyway that was that and I put it back and I forgot about it I suppose.",
    "But when all the fuss came up about the Will and there was talk of how it had been forged and Mrs LlewellynSmythe could never have written that codicil herself  for thats what they were saying mind you as it wasnt the old\nlady who had written that at all it was somebody else \nI see said Mrs Oliver.",
    "And so what did you do\nI didnt do anything.",
    "And thats whats worrying me...",
    "I didnt get the hang of things at once.",
    "And when Id thought\nthings over a bit I didnt know rightly what I ought to do and I thought well it was all talk because the Lawyers\nwere against the foreigner like people always are.",
    "Im not very fond of foreigners myself Ill admit.",
    "At any rate\nthere it was and the young lady herself was swan king about giving herself airs looking as pleased as Punch and I\nthought well maybe its all a legal thing of some kind and theyll say shes no right to the money because she wasnt\nrelated to the old lady.",
    "So everything will be all right.",
    "And it was in a way because you see they gave up the idea of\nbringing the case.",
    "It didnt come to court at all and as far as anyone knew Miss Olga ran away.",
    "Went off back to the\nContinent somewhere where she came from.",
    "So it looks as though there must have been some hocus pocus of some\nkind on her part.",
    "Maybe she threatened the old lady and made her do it.",
    "You never know do you One of my\nnephews whos going to be a doctor says you can do wonderful things with hypnotism.",
    "I thought perhaps she\nhypnotised the old lady.",
    "This was how long ago\nMrs LlewellynSmythes been dead for  let me see nearly two years.",
    "And it didnt worry you\nNo it didnt worry me.",
    "Not at the time.",
    "Because you see I didnt rightly see that it mattered.",
    "Everything was all\nright there wasnt any question of that Miss Olga getting away with the money so I didnt see as it was any call for\nme\n\nBut now you feel differently\nIts that nasty death  that child that was pushed into a bucket of apples.",
    "Saying things about a murder saying shed\nseen something or known something about a murder.",
    "And I thought maybe as Miss Olga had murdered the old lady\nbecause she knew all this money was coming to her and then she got the wind up when there was a fuss and lawyers\nand the police maybe and so she ran away.",
    "So then I thought well perhaps I ought to  well I ought to tell\nsomeone and I thought youd be a lady as has got friends in legal departments.",
    "Friends in the police perhaps and\n\n\fyoud explain to them that I was only dusting a bookshelf and this paper was there in a book and I put it back where\nit belonged.",
    "I didnt take it away or anything.",
    "But thats what happened was it on that occasion You saw Mrs LlewellynSmythe write a codicil to her Will.",
    "You\nsaw her write her name and you yourself and this Jim someone were both there and you both wrote your own names\nyourselves.",
    "Thats it isnt it\nThats right.",
    "So if you both saw Mrs LlewellynSmythe write her name then that signature couldnt have been a forgery could\nit Not if you saw her write it herself.",
    "I saw her write it herself and thats the absolute truth Im speaking.",
    "And Jimd say so too only hes gone to Australia\nhe has.",
    "Went over a year ago and I dont know his address or anything.",
    "He didnt come from these parts anyway.",
    "And what do you want me to do\nWell I want you to tell me if theres anything I ought to say or do now.",
    "Nobodys asked me mind you.",
    "Nobody\never asked me if I knew anything about a Will.",
    "Your name is Leaman.",
    "What Christian name\nHarriet.",
    "Harriet Leaman And Jim what was his last name\nWell now what was it Jenkins.",
    "Thats right.",
    "James Jenkins.",
    "Id be much obliged if you could help me because it\nworries me you see.",
    "All this trouble coming along and if that Miss Olga did it murdered Mrs LlewellynSmythe I\nmean and young Joyce saw her do it... She was ever so cockahoop about it all Miss Olga was I mean about\nhearing from the lawyers as shed come into a lot of money.",
    "But it was different when the police came round asking\nquestions and she went off very sudden she did.",
    "Nobody asked me anything they didnt.",
    "But now I cant help\nwondering if I ought to have said something at the time.",
    "I think said Mrs Oliver that you will probably have to tell this story of yours to whoever represented Mrs\nLlewellynSmythe as a lawyer.",
    "Im sure a good lawyer will quite understand your feelings and your motive.",
    "Well Im sure if youd say a word for me and tell them being a lady as knows whats what how it came about and\nhow I never meant to  well not to do anything dishonest in any way.",
    "I mean all I did \nAll you did was to say nothing said Mrs Oliver.",
    "It seems quite a reasonable explanation.",
    "And if it could come from you saying a word for me first you know to explain Id be ever so grateful.",
    "Ill do what I can said Mrs Oliver.",
    "Her eyes strayed to the garden path where she saw a neat figure approaching.",
    "Well thanks ever so much.",
    "They said as you were a very nice lady and Im sure Im much obliged to you.",
    "She rose to her feet replaced the cotton gloves which she had twisted entirely off in her anguish made a kind of half\nnod or bob and trotted off.",
    "Mrs Oliver waited until Poirot approached.",
    "Come here she said and sit down.",
    "Whats the matter with you You look upset.",
    "My feet are extremely painful said Hercule Poirot.",
    "Its those awful tight patent leather shoes of yours said Mrs Oliver.",
    "Sit down.",
    "Tell me what you came to tell me\nand then Ill tell you something that you may be surprised to hear\n\n\fChapter 18\nPoirot sat down stretched out his legs and said Ah that is better.",
    "Take your shoes off said Mrs Oliver and rest your feet.",
    "No no.",
    "I could not do that.",
    "Poirot sounded shocked at the possibility.",
    "Well were old friends together said Mrs Oliver and Judith wouldnt mind if she came out of the house.",
    "You\nknow if youll excuse me saying so you oughtnt to wear patent leather shoes in the country.",
    "Why dont you get\nyourself a nice pair of suede shoes Or the things all the hippylooking boys wear nowadays You know the sort of\nshoes that slip on and you never have to clean them  apparently they clean themselves by some extraordinary\nprocess or other.",
    "One of these laboursaving gimmicks.",
    "I would not care for that at all said Poirot severely.",
    "No indeed\nThe trouble with you is said Mrs Oliver beginning to unwrap a package on the table which she had obviously\nrecently purchased the trouble with you is that you insist on being smart.",
    "You mind more about your clothes and\nyour moustaches and how you look and what you wear than comfort.",
    "Now comfort is really the great thing.",
    "Once\nyouve passed say fifty comfort is the only thing that matters.",
    "Madame ch\u00e9re Madame I do not know that I agree with you.",
    "Well youd better said Mrs Oliver.",
    "If not you will suffer a great deal and it will be worse year after year.",
    "Mrs Oliver fished a gaily covered box from its paper bag.",
    "Removing the lids of this she picked up a small portion of\nits contents and transferred it to her mouth.",
    "She then licked her fingers wiped them on a handkerchief and murmured rather indistinctly\nSticky.",
    "Do you no longer eat apples I have always seen you with a bag of apples in your hand or eating them or on\noccasions the bag breaks and they tumble out on the road.",
    "I told you said Mrs Oliver I told you that I never want to see an apple again.",
    "No.",
    "I hate apples.",
    "I suppose I shall\nget over it some day and eat them again but well I dont like the associations of apples.",
    "And what is it that you eat now\nPoirot picked up the gaily coloured lid decorated with a picture of a palm tree.",
    "Tunis dates he read.",
    "Ah dates now.",
    "Thats right said Mrs Oliver.",
    "Dates.",
    "She took another date and put it in her mouth removed a stone which she threw into a bush and continued to munch.",
    "Dates said Poirot.",
    "It is extraordinary.",
    "What is extraordinary about eating dates People do.",
    "No no I do not mean that.",
    "Not eating them.",
    "It is extraordinary that you should say to me like that  dates.",
    "Why asked Mrs Oliver.",
    "Because said Poirot again and again you indicate to me the path the  how do you say the chemin  that I\nshould take or that I should have already taken.",
    "You show me the way that I should go.",
    "Dates.",
    "Till this moment I did\nnot realise how important dates were.",
    "I cant see that dates have anything to do with whats happened here.",
    "I mean theres no real time involved.",
    "The\nwhole thing took place what  only five days ago.",
    "That event took place four days ago.",
    "Yes that is very true.",
    "But to everything that happens there has to be a past.",
    "A\npast which is by now incorporated in today but which existed yesterday or last month or last year.",
    "The present is\nnearly always rooted in the past.",
    "A year two years perhaps even three years ago a murder was committed.",
    "A child\nsaw that murder.",
    "Because that child saw that murder on a certain date now long gone by that child died four days\nago.",
    "Is not that so\nYes.",
    "Thats so.",
    "At least I suppose it is.",
    "It mightnt have been at all.",
    "It might be just some mentally disturbed nut\nwho likes killing people and whose idea of playing with water is to push somebodys head under it and hold it there.",
    "It might have been described as a mental delinquents bit of fun at a party.",
    "It was not that belief that brought you to me Madame.",
    "No said Mrs Oliver no it wasnt.",
    "I didnt like the feel of things.",
    "I still dont like the feel of things.",
    "And I agree with you.",
    "I think you are quite right.",
    "If one does not like the feel of things one must learn why.",
    "I am\ntrying very hard though you may not think so to learn why.",
    "By going around and talking to people finding out if they are nice or not and then asking them questions\nExactly.",
    "And what have you learnt\nFacts said Poirot.",
    "Facts which will have in due course to be anchored in their place by dates shall we say.",
    "Is that all What else have you learnt\nThat nobody believes in the veracity of Joyce Reynolds.",
    "When she said she saw someone killed But I heard her.",
    "Yes she said it.",
    "But nobody believes it is true.",
    "The probability is therefore that it was not true.",
    "That she saw no\nsuch thing.",
    "It seems to me said Mrs Oliver as though your facts were leading you backwards instead of remaining on the\nspot or going forward.",
    "Things have to be made to accord.",
    "Take forgery for instance.",
    "The fact of forgery.",
    "Everybody says that a foreign\ngirl the au pair girl so endeared herself to an elderly and very rich widow that that rich widow left a Will or a\ncodicil to a Will leaving all her money to this girl.",
    "Did the girl forge that Will or did somebody else forge it\nWho else could have forged it\nThere was another forger in this village.",
    "Someone that is who had once been accused of forgery but had got off\nlightly as a first offender and with extenuating circumstances.",
    "Is that a new character One I know\nNo you do not know him.",
    "He is dead.",
    "Oh When did he die\n\n\fAbout two years ago.",
    "The exact date I do not as yet know.",
    "But I shall have to know.",
    "He is someone who had\npractised forgery and who lived in this place.",
    "And because of a little  what you might call girl trouble  arousing\njealousy and various emotions he was knifed one night and died.",
    "I have the idea you see that a lot of separated\nincidents might tie up more closely than anyone has thought.",
    "Not all of them.",
    "Probably not all of them but several\nof them.",
    "It sounds interesting said Mrs Oliver but I cant see \nNor can I as yet said Poirot.",
    "But I think dates might help.",
    "Dates of certain happenings where people were what\nhappened to them what they were doing.",
    "Everybody thinks that the foreign girl forged the Will and probably said\nPoirot everybody was right.",
    "She was the one to gain by it was she not Wait  wait \nWait for what said Mrs Oliver.",
    "An idea that passed through my head said Poirot.",
    "Mrs Oliver sighed and took another date.",
    "You return to London Madame Or are you making a long stay here\nDay after tomorrow said Mrs Oliver.",
    "I cant stay any longer.",
    "Ive got a good many things cropping up.",
    "Tell me now in your flat your house I cannot remember which it is now you have moved so many times lately\nthere is room there to have guests\nI never admit that there is said Mrs Oliver.",
    "If you ever admit that youve got a free guest room in London youve\nasked for it.",
    "All your friends and not only your friends your acquaintances or indeed your acquaintances third\ncousins sometimes write you letters and say would you mind just putting them up for a night.",
    "Well I do mind.",
    "What\nwith sheets and laundry pillow cases and wanting early morning tea and very often expecting meals served to them\npeople come.",
    "So I dont let on that I have got an available spare room.",
    "My friends come and stay with me.",
    "The\npeople I really want to see but the others  no Im not helpful.",
    "I dont like just being made use of.",
    "Who does said Hercule Poirot.",
    "You are very wise.",
    "And anyway whats all this about\nYou could put up one or two guests if need arose\nI could said Mrs Oliver.",
    "Who do you want me to put up Not you yourself.",
    "Youve got a splendid flat of your\nown.",
    "Ultra modern very abstract all squares and cubes.",
    "It is just that there might be a wise precaution to take.",
    "For whom Somebody else going to be killed\nI trust and pray not but it might be within the bounds of possibility.",
    "But who Who I cant understand.",
    "How well do you know your friend\nKnow her Not well.",
    "I mean we liked each other on a cruise and got in the habit of pairing off together.",
    "There was\nsomething  what shall I say  exciting about her.",
    "Different.",
    "Did you think you might put her in a book some day\nI do hate that phrase being used.",
    "People are always saying it to me and its not true.",
    "Not really.",
    "I dont put people in\nbooks.",
    "People I meet people I know.",
    "It is perhaps not true to say Madame that you do put people in books sometimes People that you meet but not I\nagree people that you know.",
    "There would be no fun in that.",
    "Youre quite right said Mrs Oliver.",
    "Youre really rather good at guessing things sometimes.",
    "It does happen that\nway.",
    "I mean you see a fat woman sitting in a bus eating a currant bun and her lips are moving as well as eating and\nyou can see shes either saying something to someone or thinking up a telephone call that shes going to make or\nperhaps a letter shes going to write.",
    "And you look at her and you study her shoes and the skirt shes got on and her\nhat and guess her age and whether shes got a wedding ring on and a few other things.",
    "And then you get out of the\nbus.",
    "You dont want ever to see her again but youve got a story in your mind about somebody called Mrs Carnaby\nwho is going home in a bus having had a very strange interview somewhere where she saw someone in a pastry\ncooks and was reminded of someone shed only met once and who she had heard was dead and apparently isnt\ndead.",
    "Dear me said Mrs Oliver pausing for breath.",
    "You know its quite true.",
    "I did sit across from someone in a bus just before I left London and here it is all working\nout beautifully inside my head.",
    "I shall have the whole story soon.",
    "The whole sequence what shes going back to say\nwhether itll run her into danger or somebody else into danger.",
    "I think I even know her name.",
    "Her names Constance.",
    "Constance Carnaby.",
    "Theres only one thing would ruin it.",
    "And what is that\nWell I mean if I met her again in another bus or spoke to her or she talked to me or I began to know something\nabout her.",
    "That would ruin everything of course.",
    "Yes yes.",
    "The story must be yours the character is yours.",
    "She is your child.",
    "You have made her you begin to\nunderstand her you know how she feels you know where she lives and you know what she does.",
    "But that all started\nwith a real live human being and if you found out what the real live human being was like  well then there would\nbe no story would there\nRight again said Mrs Oliver.",
    "As to what you were saying about Judith I think that is true.",
    "I mean we were together a lot on the cruise and we\nwent to see the places but I didnt really get to know her particularly well.",
    "Shes a widow and her husband died and\nshe was left badly off with one child Miranda whom youve seen.",
    "And its true that Ive got rather a funny feeling\nabout them.",
    "A feeling as though they mattered as though theyre mixed up in some interesting drama.",
    "I dont want to\nknow what the drama is.",
    "I dont want them to tell me.",
    "I want to think of the sort of drama I would like them to be in.",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes I can see that they are well candidates for inclusion for another best seller by Ariadne Oliver.",
    "You really are a beast sometimes said Mrs Oliver.",
    "You make it all sound so vulgar.",
    "She paused thoughtfully.",
    "Perhaps it is.",
    "No no it is not vulgar.",
    "It is just human.",
    "And you want me to invite Judith and Miranda to my flat or house in London\nNot yet said Poirot.",
    "Not yet until I am sure that one of my little ideas might be right.",
    "You and your little ideas Now Ive got a piece of news for you.",
    "Madame you delight me.",
    "Dont be too sure.",
    "It will probably upset your ideas.",
    "Supposing I tell you that the forgery you have been so busy\ntalking about wasnt a forgery at all.",
    "What is that you say\nMrs Ap Jones Smythe or whatever her name is did make a codicil to her Will leaving all her money to the au pair\n\n\fgirl and she signed it and two witnesses saw her sign it and signed it also in the presence of each other.",
    "Put that in\nyour moustache and smoke it.",
    "Chapter 19\nMrs Leaman said Poirot writing down the name.",
    "Thats right.",
    "Harriet Leaman.",
    "And the other witness seems to have been a James Jenkins.",
    "Last heard of going to\nAustralia.",
    "And Miss Olga Seminoff seems to have been last heard of returning to Czechoslovakia or wherever she\ncame from.",
    "Everybody seems to have gone somewhere else.",
    "How reliable do you think this Mrs Leaman is\nI dont think she made it all up if thats what you mean.",
    "I think she signed something that she was curious about it\nand that she took the first opportunity she had of finding out what shed signed.",
    "She can read and write\nI suppose so.",
    "But I agree that people arent very good sometimes at reading old ladies handwriting which is very\nspiky and very hard to read.",
    "If there were any rumours flying about later about this Will or codicil she might have\nthought that that was what shed read in this rather undecipherable handwriting.",
    "A genuine document said Poirot.",
    "But there was also a forged codicil.",
    "Who says so\nLawyers.",
    "Perhaps it wasnt forged at all.",
    "Lawyers are very particular about these matters.",
    "They were prepared to come into court with expert witnesses.",
    "Oh well said Mrs Oliver then its easy to see what must have happened isnt it\nWhat is easy What happened\nWell of course the next day or a few days later or even as much as a week later Mrs LlewellynSmythe either had\na bit of a tiff with her devoted au pair attendant or she had a delicious reconciliation with her nephew Hugo or her\nniece Rowena and she tore up the Will or scratched out the codicil or something like that or burnt the whole\nthing.",
    "And after that\nWell after that I suppose Mrs LlewellynSmythe dies and the girl seizes her chance and writes a new codicil in\nroughly the same terms in as near to Mrs LlewellynSmythes handwriting as she can and the two witnessing\nsignatures as near as she can.",
    "She probably knows Mrs Leaman writing quite well.",
    "It would be on national health\ncards or something like that and she produces it thinking that someone will agree to having witnessed the Will and\nthat all would be well.",
    "But her forgery isnt good enough and so trouble starts.",
    "Will you permit me ch\u00e9re Madame to use your telephone\nI will permit you to use Judith Butlers telephone yes.",
    "Where is your friend\nOh shes gone to get her hair done.",
    "And Miranda has gone for a walk.",
    "Go on its in the room through the window\nthere.",
    "Poirot went in and returned about ten minutes later.",
    "Well What have you been doing\nI rang up Mr Fullerton the solicitor.",
    "I will now tell you something.",
    "The codicil the forged codicil that was\nproduced for probate was not witnessed by Harriet Leaman It was witnessed by a Mary Doherty deceased who had\nbeen in service with Mrs LlewellynSmythe but had recently died.",
    "The other witness was the James Jenkins who as\nyour friend Mrs Leaman has told you departed for Australia.",
    "So there was a forged codicil said Mrs Oliver.",
    "And there seems to have been a real codicil as well.",
    "Look here Poirot isnt this all getting a little too complicated\nIt is getting incredibly complicated said Hercule Poirot.",
    "There is if I may mention it too much forgery about.",
    "Perhaps the real one is still in the library at Quarry House within the pages of Enquire Within upon Everything.",
    "I understand all the effects of the house were sold up at Mrs LlewellynSmythes death except for a few pieces of\nfamily furniture and some family pictures.",
    "What we need said Mrs Oliver is something like Enquire Within here now.",
    "Its a lovely title isnt it I remember\nmy grandmother had one.",
    "You could you know inquire within about everything too.",
    "Legal information and\ncooking recipes and how to take ink stains out of linen.",
    "How to make homemade face powder that would not\ndamage the complexion.",
    "Oh  and lots more.",
    "Yes wouldnt you like to have a book like that now\nDoubtless said Hercule Poirot it would give the recipe for treatment of tired feet.",
    "Plenty of them I should think.",
    "But why dont you wear proper country shoes\nMadame I like to look soign\u00e9 in my appearance.",
    "Well then youll have to go on wearing things that are painful and grin and bear it said Mrs Oliver.",
    "All the\nsame I dont understand anything now.",
    "Was that Leaman woman telling me a pack of lies just now\nIt is always possible.",
    "Did someone tell her to tell a pack of lies\nThat too is possible.",
    "Did someone pay her to tell me a pack of lies\nContinue said Poirot continue.",
    "You are doing very nicely.",
    "I suppose said Mrs Oliver thoughtfully that Mrs LlewellynSmythe like many another rich woman enjoyed\nmaking Wills.",
    "I expect she made a good many during her life.",
    "You know benefiting one person and then another.",
    "Changing about.",
    "The Drakes were well off anyway.",
    "I expect she always left them at least a handsome legacy but I\nwonder if she ever left anyone else as much as she appears according to Mrs Leaman and according to the forged\nWill as well to that girl Olga.",
    "Id like to know a bit more about that girl I must say.",
    "She certainly seems a very\nsuccessful disappearess.",
    "I hope to know more about her shortly said Hercule Poirot.",
    "How\nInformation that I shall receive shortly.",
    "I know youve been asking for information down here.",
    "Not here only.",
    "I have an agent in London who obtains information for me both abroad and in this country.",
    "I should\nhave some news possibly soon from Herzogovinia.",
    "Will you find out if she ever arrived back there\nThat might be one thing I should learn but it seems more likely that I may get information of a different kind letters perhaps written during her sojourn in this country mentioning friends she may have made here and become\nintimate with.",
    "What about the schoolteacher said Mrs Oliver.",
    "Which one do you mean\nI mean the one who was strangled the one Elizabeth Whittaker told you about She added I dont like Elizabeth\nWhittaker much.",
    "Tiresome sort of woman but clever I should think.",
    "She added dreamily I wouldnt put it past\nher to have thought up a murder.",
    "Strangle another teacher do you mean\nOne has to exhaust all the possibilities.",
    "I shall rely as so often on your intuition Madame.",
    "Mrs Oliver ate another date thoughtfully.",
    "Chapter 20\nWhen he left Mrs Butlers house Poirot took the same way as had been shown him by Miranda.",
    "The aperture in the\nhedge it seemed to him had been slightly enlarged since last time.",
    "Somebody perhaps with slightly more bulk than\nMiranda had used it also.",
    "He ascended the path in the quarry noticing once more the beauty of the scene.",
    "A lovely\nspot and yet in some way Poirot felt as he had felt before that it could be a haunted spot.",
    "There was a kind of\npagan ruthlessness about it.",
    "It could be along these winding paths that the fairies hunted their victims down or a cold\ngoddess decreed that sacrifices would have to be offered.",
    "He could understand why it had not become a picnic spot.",
    "One would not want for some reason to bring your hardboiled eggs and your lettuce and your oranges and sit down here and crack jokes and have a jollification.",
    "It was\ndifferent quite different.",
    "It would have been better perhaps he thought suddenly if Mrs LlewellynSmythe had not\nwanted this fairylike transformation.",
    "Quite a modest sunk garden could have been made out of a quarry without the\natmosphere but she had been an ambitious woman ambitious and a very rich woman.",
    "He thought for a moment or\ntwo about Wills the kind of Wills made by rich women the kind of lies told about Wills made by rich women the\nplaces in which the Wills of rich widows were sometimes hidden and he tried to put himself back into the mind of a\nforger.",
    "Undoubtedly the Will offered for probate had been a forgery.",
    "Mr Fullerton was a careful and competent\nlawyer.",
    "He was sure of that.",
    "The kind of lawyer too who would never advise a client to bring a case or to take legal\nproceedings unless there was very good evidence and justification for so doing.",
    "He turned a corner of the pathway\nfeeling for the moment that his feet were much more important than his speculations.",
    "Was he taking a short cut to Superintendent Spences dwelling or was he not As the crow flies perhaps but the\nmain road might have been more good to his feet.",
    "This path was not a grassy or mossy one it had the quarry\nhardness of stone.",
    "Then he paused.",
    "In front of him were two figures.",
    "Sitting on an outcrop of rock was Michael Garfield.",
    "He had a sketching block on\nhis knees and he was drawing his attention fully on what he was doing.",
    "A little way away from him standing close\nbeside a minute but musical stream that flowed down from above Miranda Butler was standing.",
    "Hercule Poirot\nforgot his feet forgot the pains and ills of the human body and concentrated again on the beauty that human beings\ncould attain.",
    "There was no doubt that Michael Garfield was a very beautiful young man.",
    "He found it difficult to\nknow whether he himself liked Michael Garfield or not.",
    "It is always difficult to know if you like anyone beautiful.",
    "You like beauty to look at at the same time you dislike beauty almost on principle.",
    "Women could be beautiful but\nHercule Poirot was not at all sure that he liked beauty in men.",
    "He would not have liked to be a beautiful young man\nhimself not that there had ever been the least chance of that.",
    "There was only one thing about his own appearance\nwhich really pleased Hercule Poirot and that was the profusion of his moustaches and the way they responded to\ngrooming and treatment and trimming.",
    "They were magnificent.",
    "He knew of nobody else who had any moustache\nhalf as good.",
    "He had never been handsome or goodlooking.",
    "Certainly never beautiful.",
    "And Miranda He thought again as he had thought before that it was her gravity that was so attractive.",
    "He\nwondered what passed through her mind.",
    "It was the sort of thing one would never know.",
    "She would not say what she\nwas thinking easily.",
    "He doubted if she would tell you what she was thinking if you asked her.",
    "She had an original\nmind he thought a reflective mind.",
    "He thought too she was vulnerable.",
    "Very vulnerable.",
    "There were other things about her that he knew or thought he knew.",
    "It was only thinking so far\nbut yet he was almost sure.",
    "Michael Garfield looked up and said.",
    "Ha Se\u00f1or Moustachios.",
    "A very good afternoon to you sir.",
    "Can I look at what you are doing or would it incommode you I do not want to be intrusive.",
    "You can look said Michael Garfield it makes no difference to me.",
    "He added gently Im enjoying myself very\nmuch.",
    "Poirot came to stand behind his shoulder.",
    "He nodded.",
    "It was a very delicate pencil drawing the lines almost\ninvisible.",
    "The man could draw Poirot thought.",
    "Not only design gardens.",
    "He said almost under his breath\nExquisite\nI think so too said Michael Garfield.",
    "He let it be left doubtful whether he referred to the drawing he was making or to the sitter.",
    "Why asked Poirot.",
    "Why am I doing it Do you think I have a reason\nYou might have.",
    "Youre quite right.",
    "If I go away from here there are one or two things I want to remember.",
    "Miranda is one of them.",
    "Would you forget her easily\nVery easily.",
    "I am like that.",
    "But to have forgotten something or someone to be unable to bring a face a turn of a\nshoulder a gesture a tree a flower a contour of landscape to know what it was like to see it but not to be able to\nbring that image in front of ones eyes that sometimes causes  what shall I say  almost agony.",
    "You see you record\n and it all passes away.",
    "Not the Quarry Garden or park.",
    "That has not passed away.",
    "Dont you think so It soon will.",
    "It soon will if no one is here.",
    "Nature takes over you know.",
    "It needs love and\nattention and care and skill.",
    "If a Council takes it over  and thats what happens very often nowadays  then it will be\nwhat they call kept up.",
    "The latest sort of shrubs may be put in extra paths will be made seats will be put at certain\ndistances.",
    "Litter bins even may be erected.",
    "Oh they are so careful so kind at preserving.",
    "You cant preserve this.",
    "Its\nwild.",
    "To keep something wild is far more difficult than to preserve it.",
    "Monsieur Poirot.",
    "Mirandas voice came across the stream.",
    "Poirot moved forward so that he came within earshot of\nher.",
    "So I find you here.",
    "So you came to sit for your portrait did you She shook her head.",
    "I didnt come for that.",
    "That just happened.",
    "Yes said Michael Garfield yes it just happened.",
    "A piece of luck sometimes comes ones way.",
    "You were just walking in your favourite garden\nI was looking for the well really said Miranda.",
    "A well\n\n\fThere was a wishing well once in this wood.",
    "In a former quarry I didnt know they kept wells in quarries.",
    "There was always a wood round the quarry.",
    "Well there were always trees here.",
    "Michael knows where the well is\nbut he wont tell me.",
    "It will be much more fun for you said Michael Garfield to go on looking for it.",
    "Especially when youre not at all\nsure it really exists.",
    "Old Mrs Goodbody knows all about it.",
    "And added Shes a witch.",
    "Quite right said Michael.",
    "Shes the local witch Monsieur Poirot.",
    "Theres always a local witch you know in most\nplaces.",
    "They dont always call themselves witches but everyone knows.",
    "They tell a fortune or put a spell on your\nbegonias or shrivel up your peonies or stop a farmers cow from giving milk and probably give love potions as well.",
    "It was a wishing well said Miranda.",
    "People used to come here and wish.",
    "They had to go round it three times\nbackwards and it was on the side of the hill so it wasnt always very easy to do.",
    "She looked past Poirot at Michael\nGarfield.",
    "I shall find it one day she said even if you wont tell me.",
    "Its here somewhere but it was sealed up Mrs\nGoodbody said.",
    "Oh years ago.",
    "Sealed up because it was said to be dangerous.",
    "A child fell into it years ago  Kitty\nSomebody.",
    "Someone else might have fallen into it.",
    "Well go on thinking so said Michael Garfield.",
    "Its a good local story but there is a wishing well over at Little Belling.",
    "Of course said Miranda I know all about that one.",
    "Its a very common one she said.",
    "Everybody knows about it and its very silly.",
    "People throw pennies into it and theres not any water in it any more\nso theres not even a splash.",
    "Well Im sorry.",
    "Ill tell you when I find it said Miranda.",
    "You mustnt always believe everything a witch says.",
    "I dont believe any child ever fell into it.",
    "I expect a cat fell into\nit once and got drowned.",
    "Ding dong dell pussys in the well said Miranda.",
    "She got up.",
    "I must go now she said.",
    "Mummy will be expecting me.",
    "She moved carefully from the knob of rock smiled at both the men and went off down an even more intransigent\npath that ran the other side of the water.",
    "Ding dong dell said Poirot thoughtfully.",
    "One believes what one wants to believe Michael Garfield.",
    "Was she\nright or was she not right Michael Garfield looked at him thoughtfully then he smiled.",
    "She is quite right he said.",
    "There is a well and it is as she says sealed up.",
    "I suppose it may have been dangerous.",
    "I\ndont think it was ever a wishing well.",
    "I think thats Mrs Goodbodys own bit of fancy talk.",
    "Theres a wishing tree or\nthere was once.",
    "A beech tree halfway up the hillside that I believe people did go round three times backwards and\nwished.",
    "Whats happened to that Dont they go round it any more\nNo.",
    "I believe it was struck by lightning about six years ago.",
    "Split in two.",
    "So that pretty storys gone west.",
    "Have you told Miranda about that\nNo.",
    "I thought Id rather leave her with her well.",
    "A blasted beech wouldnt be much fun for her would it\nI must go on my way said Poirot.",
    "Going back to your police friend\nYes.",
    "You look tired.",
    "I am tired said Hercule Poirot.",
    "I am extremely tired.",
    "Youd be more comfortable in canvas shoes or sandals.",
    "Ah \u00e7\u00e0 non.",
    "I see.",
    "You are sartorially ambitious.",
    "He looked at Poirot.",
    "The tout ensemble it is very good and especially if I may mention it your superb moustache.",
    "I am gratified said Poirot that you have noticed it.",
    "The point is rather could anyone not notice it Poirot put his head on one side.",
    "Then he said You spoke of the\ndrawing you are doing because you wish to remember the young Miranda.",
    "Does that mean youre going away from\nhere\nI have thought of it yes.",
    "Yet you are it seems to me bien plac\u00e9 ici.",
    "Oh yes eminently so.",
    "I have a house to live in a house small but designed by myself and I have my work but that\nis less satisfactory than it used to be.",
    "So restlessness is coming over me.",
    "Why is your work less satisfactory\nBecause people wish me to do the most atrocious things.",
    "People who want to improve their gardens people who\nbought some land and theyre building a house and want the garden designed.",
    "Are you not doing her garden for Mrs Drake\nShe wants me to yes.",
    "I made suggestions for it and she see used to agree with them.",
    "I dont think though he\nadded thoughtfully that I really trust her.",
    "You mean that she would not let you have what you wanted\nI mean that she would certainly have what she wanted herself and that though she is attracted by the ideas I have set\nout she would suddenly demand something quite different.",
    "Something utilitarian expensive and showy perhaps.",
    "She would bully me I think.",
    "She would insist on her ideas being carried out.",
    "I would not agree and we should\nquarrel.",
    "So on the whole it is better I leave here before I quarrel.",
    "And not only with Mrs Drake but many other\nneighbours.",
    "I am quite well known.",
    "I dont need to stay in one spot.",
    "I could go and find some other corner of\nEngland or it could be some corner of Normandy or Brittany.",
    "Somewhere where you can improve or help nature Somewhere where you can experiment or you can put strange\nthings where they have never grown before where neither sun will blister nor frost destroy Some good stretch of\nbarren land where you can have the fun of playing at being Adam all over again Have you always been restless\nI never stayed anywhere very long.",
    "You have been to Greece\nYes.",
    "I should like to go to Greece again.",
    "Yes you have something there.",
    "A garden on a Greek hillside.",
    "There may\nbe cypresses there not much else.",
    "A barren rock.",
    "But if you wished what could there not be\nA garden for gods to walk \nYes.",
    "Youre quite a mind reader arent you Mr Poirot\nI wish I were.",
    "There are so many things I would like to know and do not know.",
    "You are talking now of something quite prosaic are you not\nUnfortunately so.",
    "Arson murder and sudden death\nMore or less.",
    "I do not know that I was considering arson.",
    "Tell me Mr Garfield you have been here some\nconsiderable time did you know a young man called Lesley Ferrier\nYes I remember him.",
    "He was in a Medchester solicitors office wasnt he\nFullerton Harrison and Leadbetter.",
    "Junior clerk something of that kind.",
    "Goodlooking chap.",
    "He came to a sudden end did he not\nYes.",
    "Got himself knifed one evening.",
    "Woman trouble I gather.",
    "Everyone seems to think that the police know quite\nwell who did it but they cant get the evidence they want.",
    "He was more or less tied up with a woman called Sandra cant remember her name for the moment  Sandra Somebody yes.",
    "Her husband kept the local pub.",
    "She and young\nLesley were running an affair and then Lesley took up with another girl.",
    "Or that was the story.",
    "And Sandra did not like it\nNo she did not like it at all.",
    "Mind you he was a great one for the girls.",
    "There were two or three that he went around\nwith.",
    "Were they all English girls\nWhy do you ask that I wonder No I dont think he confined himself to English girls so long as they could speak\nenough English to understand more or less what he said to them and he could understand what they said to him.",
    "There are doubtless from time to time foreign girls in this neighbourhood\nOf course there are.",
    "Is there any neighbourhood where there arent Au pair girls theyre a part of daily life.",
    "Ugly\nones pretty ones honest ones dishonest ones ones that do some good to distracted mothers and some who are no\nuse at all and some who walk out of the house.",
    "Like the girl Olga did.",
    "As you say like the girl Olga did.",
    "Was Lesley a friend of Olgas\n\n\fOh thats the way your mind is running.",
    "Yes he was.",
    "I dont think Mrs LlewellynSmythe knew much about it.",
    "Olga was rather careful I think.",
    "She spoke gravely of someone she hoped to marry some day in her own country.",
    "I\ndont know whether that was true or whether she made it up.",
    "Young Lesley was an attractive young man as I said.",
    "I\ndont know what he saw in Olga  she wasnt very beautiful.",
    "Still  he considered a minute or two  she had a kind\nof intensity about her.",
    "A young Englishman might have found that attractive I think.",
    "Anyway Lesley did all right\nand his other girl friends werent pleased.",
    "That is very interesting said Poirot.",
    "I thought you might give me information that I wanted.",
    "Michael Garfield looked at him curiously.",
    "Why Whats it all about Where does Lesley come in Why this raking up of the past\nWell there are things one wants to know.",
    "One wants to know how things come into being.",
    "I am even looking\nfarther back still.",
    "Before the time that those two Olga Seminoff and Lesley Ferrier met secretly without Mrs\nLlewellynSmythe knowing about it.",
    "Well Im not sure about that.",
    "Thats only my  well its only my idea.",
    "I did come across them fairly frequently but\nOlga never confided in me.",
    "As for Lesley Ferrier I hardly knew him.",
    "I want to go back behind that.",
    "He had I gather certain disadvantages in his past.",
    "I believe so.",
    "Yes well anyway its been said here locally.",
    "Mr Fullerton took him on and hoped to make an honest\nman of him.",
    "Hes a good chap old Fullerton.",
    "His offence had been I believe forgery\nYes.",
    "It was a first offence and there were said to be extenuating circumstances.",
    "He had a sick mother or drunken father\nor something of that kind.",
    "Anyway he got off lightly.",
    "I never heard any of the details.",
    "It was something that he seemed to have got away with to begin with then\naccountants came along and found him out.",
    "Im very vague.",
    "Its only hearsay.",
    "Forgery.",
    "Yes that was the charge.",
    "Forgery.",
    "And where Mrs LlewellynSmythe died and her Will was to be admitted to probate it was found the Will was\nforged.",
    "Yes I see the way your minds working.",
    "Youre fitting those two things as having a connection with each other.",
    "A man who was up to a point successful in forging.",
    "A man who became friends with the girl a girl who if a Will\nhad been accepted when submitted to probate would have inherited the larger part of a vast fortune.",
    "Yes yes thats the way it goes.",
    "And this girl and the man who had committed forgery were great friends.",
    "He had given up his own girl and hed\ntied up with the foreign girl instead.",
    "What youre suggesting is that that forged Will was forged by Lesley Ferrier.",
    "There seems a likelihood of it does there not\nOlga was supposed to have been able to copy Mrs LlewellynSmythes handwriting fairly well but it seemed to me\nalways that that was rather a doubtful point.",
    "She wrote handwritten letters for Mrs LlewellynSmythe but I dont\nsuppose that they were really particularly similar.",
    "Not enough to pass muster.",
    "But if she and Lesley were in it\ntogether thats different.",
    "I daresay he could pass off a good enough job and he was probably quite cocksure that it\nwould go through.",
    "But then he must have been sure of that when he committed his original offence and he was\n\n\fwrong there and I suppose he was wrong this time.",
    "I suppose that when the balloon went up when the lawyers\nbegan making trouble and difficulties and experts were called in to examine things and started asking questions it\ncould be that she lost her nerve and had a row with Lesley.",
    "And then she cleared out hoping hed carry the can.",
    "He gave his head a sharp shake.",
    "Why do you come and talk to me about things like that here in my beautiful wood\nI wanted to know.",
    "Its better not to know.",
    "Its better never to know.",
    "Better to leave things as they are.",
    "Not push and pry and poke.",
    "You want beauty said Hercule Poirot.",
    "Beauty at any price.",
    "For me it is truth I want.",
    "Always truth.",
    "Michael Garfield laughed.",
    "Go on home to your police friends and leave me here in my local paradise.",
    "Get thee beyond me Satan.",
    "Chapter 21\nPoirot went on up the hill.",
    "Suddenly he no longer felt the pain of his feet.",
    "Something had come to him.",
    "The fitting together of the things he had\nthought and felt had known they were connected but had not seen how they were connected.",
    "He was conscious\nnow of danger  danger that might come to someone any minute now unless steps were taken to prevent it.",
    "Serious\ndanger.",
    "Elspeth McKay came out to the door to meet him.",
    "You look fagged out she said.",
    "Come and sit down.",
    "Your brother is here\nNo.",
    "Hes gone down to the station.",
    "Somethings happened I believe.",
    "Something has happened He was startled.",
    "So soon Not possible.",
    "Eh said Elspeth.",
    "What do you mean\nNothing.",
    "Nothing.",
    "Something has happened to somebody do you mean\nYes but I dont know who exactly.",
    "Anyway Tim Raglan rang up and asked for him to go down there.",
    "Ill get you a\ncup of tea shall I\nNo said Poirot thank you very much but I think  I think I will go home.",
    "He could not face the prospect of\nblack bitter tea.",
    "He thought of a good excuse that would mask any signs of bad manners.",
    "My feet he explained.",
    "My feet.",
    "I am not very suitably attired as to footwear for the country.",
    "A change of shoes\nwould be desirable.",
    "Elspeth McKay looked down at them.",
    "No she said.",
    "I can see theyre not.",
    "Patent leather draws the feet.",
    "Theres a letter for you by the way.",
    "Foreign\nstamps on it.",
    "Come from abroad to Superintendent Spence Pine Crest.",
    "Ill bring it to you.",
    "She came back in a\nminute or two and handed it to him.",
    "If you dont want the envelope Id like it for one of my nephews  he collects stamps.",
    "Of course.",
    "Poirot opened the letter and handed her the envelope.",
    "She thanked him and went back into the house.",
    "Poirot unfolded the sheet and read.",
    "Mr Gobys foreign service was run with the same competence that he showed in his English one.",
    "He spared no\nexpense and got his results quickly.",
    "True the results did not amount to much  Poirot had not thought that they\nwould.",
    "Olga Seminoff had not returned to her home town.",
    "She had had no family still living.",
    "She had had a friend an\nelderly woman with whom she had corresponded intermittently giving news of her life in England.",
    "She had been\non good terms with her employer who had been occasionally exacting but has also been generous.",
    "The last letters received from Olga had been dated about a year and a half ago.",
    "In them there had been mention of a\nyoung man.",
    "There were hints that they were considering marriage but the young man whose name she did not\nmention had she said his way to make so nothing could be settled as yet.",
    "In her last letter she spoke happily of\ntheir prospects being good.",
    "When no more letters came the elderly friend assumed that Olga had married her Englishman and changed her\naddress.",
    "Such things happened frequently when girls went to England.",
    "If they were happily married they often never wrote\nagain.",
    "She had not worried.",
    "It fitted Poirot thought.",
    "Lesley had spoken of marriage but might not have meant it.",
    "Mrs LlewellynSmythe had\nbeen spoken of as generous.",
    "Lesley had been given money by someone Olga perhaps money originally given her\nby her employers to induce him to do forgery on her behalf.",
    "Elspeth McKay came out on the terrace again.",
    "Poirot consulted her as to her surmises about a partnership between\nOlga and Lesley.",
    "She considered a moment.",
    "Then the oracle spoke.",
    "Kept very quiet about it if so.",
    "Never any rumours about those two.",
    "There usually is in a place like this if theres\nanything in it.",
    "Young Ferrier was tied up to a married woman.",
    "He might have warned the girl not to say anything about him to her\nemployer.",
    "Likely enough.",
    "Mrs Smythe would probably know that Lesley Ferrier was a bad character and would warn the girl\nto have nothing to do with him.",
    "Poirot folded up the letter and put it into his pocket.",
    "I wish youd let me get you a pot of tea.",
    "No no I must go back to my guest house and change my shoes.",
    "You do not know when your brother will be back\nIve no idea.",
    "They didnt say what they wanted him for.",
    "Poirot walked along the road to his guest house.",
    "It was\nonly a few hundred yards.",
    "As he walked up to the front door it was opened and his landlady a cheerful lady of thirty odd came out to him.",
    "Theres a lady here to see you she said.",
    "Been waiting some time.",
    "I told her I didnt know where youd gone\nexactly or when youd be back but she said shed wait.",
    "She added Its Mrs Drake.",
    "Shes in a state Id say.",
    "Shes\nusually so calm about everything but really I think shes had a shock of some kind.",
    "Shes in the sittingroom.",
    "Shall I\nbring you in some tea and something\nNo said Poirot I think it will be better not.",
    "I will hear first what she has to say.",
    "He opened the door and went into the sittingroom.",
    "Rowena Drake had been standing by the window.",
    "It was not the\n\n\fwindow overlooking the front path so she had not seen his approach.",
    "She turned abruptly as she heard the sound of\nthe door.",
    "Monsieur Poirot.",
    "At last.",
    "It seemed so long.",
    "I am sorry Madame.",
    "I have been in the Quarry Wood and also talking to my friend Mrs Oliver.",
    "And then I have\nbeen talking to two boys.",
    "To Nicholas and Desmond.",
    "Nicholas and Desmond Yes I know.",
    "I wonder oh one thinks all sorts of things.",
    "You are upset said Poirot gently.",
    "It was not a thing he thought he would ever see.",
    "Rowena Drake upset no longer mistress of events no longer\narranging everything and enforcing her decisions on others.",
    "Youve heard havent you she asked.",
    "Oh well perhaps you havent.",
    "What should I have heard\nSomething dreadful.",
    "Hes  hes dead.",
    "Somebody killed him.",
    "Who is dead Madame\nThen you havent really heard.",
    "And hes only a child too and I thought oh what a fool Ive been.",
    "I should have told\nyou.",
    "I should have told you when you asked me.",
    "It makes me feel terrible  terribly guilty for thinking I knew best\nand thinking  but I did mean it for the best Monsieur Poirot indeed I did.",
    "Sit down Madame sit down.",
    "Calm yourself and tell me.",
    "There is a child dead  another child\nHer brother said Mrs Drake.",

    "Leopold Reynolds\nYes.",
    "They found his body on one of the field paths.",
    "He must have been coming back from school and gone out of\nhis way to play in the brook near there.",
    "Somebody held him down in the brook held his head under water.",
    "The same kind of thing as they did to the child Joyce\nYes yes.",
    "I can see it must be it must be madness of some kind.",
    "And one doesnt know who thats whats so awful.",
    "One hasnt the least idea.",
    "And I thought I knew.",
    "I really thought I suppose yes it was a very wicked thing.",
    "You must tell me Madame.",
    "Yes I want to tell you.",
    "I came here to tell you.",
    "Because you see you came to me after youd talked to Elizabeth\nWhittaker.",
    "After shed told you that something had startled me.",
    "That Id seen something.",
    "Something in the hall of the\nhouse my house.",
    "I said that I hadnt seen anything and that nothing had startled me because you see I thought \nshe stopped.",
    "What did you see\nI ought to have told you then.",
    "I saw the door of the library open open rather carefully and then he came out.",
    "At\nleast he didnt come right out.",
    "He just stood in the doorway and then pulled the door back quickly and went back\ninside.",
    "Who was this\nLeopold.",
    "Leopold the child thats been killed now.",
    "And you see I thought I  oh what a mistake what an awful\n\n\fmistake.",
    "If Id told you perhaps  perhaps youd have got at what was behind it.",
    "You thought Poirot said.",
    "You thought that Leopold had killed his sister.",
    "Is that what you thought\nYes thats what I thought.",
    "Not then of course because I didnt know she was dead.",
    "But he had a queer look on his\nface.",
    "Hes always been a queer child.",
    "In a way youre a little afraid of him because you feel hes not  not quite right.",
    "Very clever and a high IQ but all the same not all there.",
    "And I thought Why is Leopold coming out of there instead of being at the Snapdragon and I thought Whats he\nbeen doing  he looks so queer And then well then I didnt think of it again after that but I suppose the way he\nlooked upset me.",
    "And thats why I dropped the vase.",
    "Elizabeth helped me to pick up the glass pieces and I went\nback to the Snapdragon and I didnt think of it again.",
    "Until we found Joyce.",
    "And thats when I thought \nYou thought that Leopold had done it.",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes I did think that.",
    "I thought it explained the way hed looked.",
    "I thought I knew.",
    "I always think  Ive thought\ntoo much all my life that I know things that Im right about things.",
    "And I can be very wrong.",
    "Because you see his\nbeing killed must mean something quite different.",
    "He must have gone in there and he must have found her there\ndead and it gave him a terrible shock and he was frightened.",
    "And so he wanted to come out of the room without\nanyone seeing him and I suppose he looked up and saw me and he got back into the room and shut the door and\nwaited until the hall was empty before coming out.",
    "But not because hed killed her.",
    "No.",
    "Just the shock of finding her\ndead.",
    "And yet you said nothing You didnt mention who it was youd seen even after the death was discovered\nNo.",
    "I  oh I couldnt.",
    "Hes  you see hes so young  was so young I suppose I ought to say now.",
    "Ten.",
    "Ten  eleven\nat most and I mean I felt he couldnt have known what he was doing it couldnt have been his fault exactly.",
    "He must\nhave been morally not responsible.",
    "Hes always been rather queer and I thought one could get treatment for him.",
    "Not leave it all to the police.",
    "Not send him to approved places.",
    "I thought one could get special psychological\ntreatment for him if necessary.",
    "I  I meant well.",
    "You must believe that I meant well.",
    "Such sad words Poirot\nthought some of the saddest words in the world.",
    "Mrs Drake seemed to know what he was thinking.",
    "Yes she said I did it for the best.",
    "I meant well.",
    "One always thinks one knows what is best to do for other people\nbut one doesnt.",
    "Because you see the reason he looked so taken aback must have been that he either saw who the\nmurderer was or saw something that would give a clue to who the murderer might be.",
    "Something that made the\nmurderer feel that he himself wasnt safe.",
    "And so  and so hes waited until he got the boy alone and then drowned\nhim in the brook so that he shouldnt speak so that he shouldnt tell.",
    "If Id only spoken out if Id told you or told the\npolice or told someone but I thought I knew best.",
    "Only today said Poirot after he had sat silent for a moment or two watching Mrs Drake where she sat controlling\nher sobs I was told that Leopold had been very flush of money lately.",
    "Somebody must have been paying him to\nkeep silent.",
    "But who  who\nWe shall find out said Poirot.",
    "It will not be long now.",
    "Chapter 22\nIt was not very characteristic of Hercule Poirot to ask the opinions of others.",
    "He was usually quite satisfied with his\nown opinions.",
    "Nevertheless there were times when he made exceptions.",
    "This was one of them.",
    "He and Spence had\nhad a brief conversation together and then Poirot had got in touch with a car hire service and after another short\nconversation with his friend and with Inspector Raglan he drove off.",
    "He had arranged with the car to drive him back\nto London but he had made one halt on the way there.",
    "He drove to The Elms.",
    "He told the driver of the car that he\nwould not be long  a quarter of an hour at most  and then he sought audience with Miss Emlyn.",
    "I am sorry to disturb you at this hour.",
    "It is no doubt the hour of your supper or dinner.",
    "Well I do you at least the compliment Monsieur Poirot to think you would not disturb me at either supper or\ndinner unless you have a valid reason for so doing.",
    "You are very kind.",
    "To be frank I want your advice.",
    "Indeed\nMiss Emlyn looked slightly surprised.",
    "She looked more than surprised she looked sceptical.",
    "That does not seem very characteristic of you Monsieur Poirot.",
    "Are you not usually satisfied with your own\nopinions\nYes I am satisfied with my own opinions but it would give me solace and support if someone whose opinion I\nrespected agreed with them.",
    "She did not speak merely looked at him inquiringly.",
    "I know the killer of Joyce Reynolds he said.",
    "It is my belief that you know it also.",
    "I have not said so said Miss Emlyn.",
    "No.",
    "You have not said so.",
    "And that might lead me to believe that it is on your part an opinion only.",
    "A hunch inquired Miss Emlyn and her tone was colder than ever.",
    "I would prefer not to use that word.",
    "I would prefer to say that you had a definite opinion.",
    "Very well then.",
    "I will admit that I have a definite opinion.",
    "That does not mean that I shall repeat to you what my\nopinion is.",
    "What I should like to do Mademoiselle is to write down four words on a piece of paper.",
    "I will ask you if you agree\nwith the four words I have written.",
    "Miss Emlyn rose.",
    "She crossed the room to her desk took a piece of writing\npaper and came across to Poirot with it.",
    "You interest me she said.",
    "Four words.",
    "Poirot had taken a pen from his pocket.",
    "He wrote on the paper folded it and handed it to her.",
    "She took it straightened out the paper and held it in her hand\nlooking at it.",
    "Well said Poirot.",
    "As to two of the words on that paper I agree yes.",
    "The other two that is more difficult.",
    "I have no evidence and\nindeed the idea had not entered my head.",
    "But in the case of the first two words you have definite evidence\nI consider so yes.",
    "Water said Poirot thoughtfully.",
    "As soon as you heard that you knew.",
    "As soon as I heard that I knew.",
    "You are\nsure and I am sure.",
    "And now said Poirot\na boy has been drowned in a brook.",
    "You have heard that\nYes.",
    "Someone rang me up on the telephone and told me.",
    "Joyces brother.",
    "How was he concerned\nHe wanted money said Poirot.",
    "He got it.",
    "And so at a suitable opportunity he was drowned in a brook.",
    "His voice did not change.",
    "It had if anything not a softened but a harsher note.",
    "The person who told me he said was riddled with compassion.",
    "Upset emotionally.",
    "But I am not like that.",
    "He was\nyoung this second child who died but his death was not an accident.",
    "It was as so many things are in life a result of\nhis actions.",
    "He wanted money and he took a risk.",
    "He was clever enough astute enough to know he was taking a risk\nbut he wanted the money.",
    "He was ten years old but cause and effect is much the same at that age as it would be at\nthirty or fifty or ninety.",
    "Do you know what I think of first in such a case\nI should say said Miss Emlyn that you are more concerned with justice than with compassion.",
    "Compassion said Poirot on my part would do nothing to help Leopold.",
    "He is beyond help.",
    "Justice if we obtain\njustice you and I for I think you are of my way of thinking over this justice one could say will also not help\nLeopold.",
    "But it might help some other Leopold it might help to keep some other child alive if we can reach justice\nsoon enough.",
    "It is not a safe thing a killer who has killed more than once to whom killing has appealed as a way of\nsecurity.",
    "I am now on my way to London where I am meeting with certain people to discuss a way of approach.",
    "To\nconvert them perhaps to my own certainty in this case.",
    "You may find that difficult said Miss Emlyn.",
    "No I do not think so.",
    "The ways and means to it may be difficult but I think I can convert them to my knowledge of\nwhat has happened.",
    "Because they have minds that understand the criminal mind.",
    "There is one thing more I would\nask you.",
    "I want your opinion.",
    "Your opinion only this time not evidence.",
    "Your opinion of the character of Nicholas\nRansom and Desmond Holland.",
    "Would you advise me to trust them\nI should say that both of them were thoroughly trustworthy.",
    "That is my opinion.",
    "They are in many ways extremely\nfoolish but that is only in the ephemeral things of life.",
    "Fundamentally they are sound.",
    "Sound as an apple without\nmaggots in it.",
    "One always comes back to apples said Hercule Poirot sadly.",
    "I must go now.",
    "My car is waiting.",
    "I have one more\ncall still to pay.",
    "Chapter 23\nHave you heard whats on at Quarry Wood said Mrs Cartwright putting a packet of Fluffy Flakelets and Wonder\nWhite into her shopping bag.",
    "Quarry Wood said Elspeth McKay to whom she was talking.",
    "No I havent heard anything particular.",
    "She\nselected a packet of cereal.",
    "The two women were in the recently opened supermarket making their morning\npurchases.",
    "Theyre saying the trees are dangerous there.",
    "Couple of forestry men arrived this morning.",
    "Its there on the side of\nthe hill where theres a steep slope and a tree leaning sideways.",
    "Could be I suppose that a tree could come down\nthere.",
    "One of them was struck by lightning last winter but that was farther over I think.",
    "Anyway theyre digging\nround the roots of the trees a bit and a bit farther down too.",
    "Pity.",
    "Theyll make an awful mess of the place.",
    "Oh well said Elspeth McKay I suppose they know what theyre doing.",
    "Somebodys called them in I suppose.",
    "Theyve got a couple of the police there too seeing that people dont come near.",
    "Making sure they keep away from\nthings.",
    "They say something about finding out which the diseased trees are first.",
    "I see said Elspeth McKay.",
    "Possibly she did.",
    "Not that anyone had told her but then Elspeth never needed telling.",
    "Ariadne Oliver smoothed out a telegram she had just taken as delivered to her at the door.",
    "She was so used to getting\ntelegrams through the telephone making frenzied hunts for a pencil to take them down insisting firmly that she\nwanted a confirmatory copy sent to her that she was quite startled to receive what she called to herself a real\ntelegram again.",
    "Please bring Mrs Butler and Miranda to your flat at once.",
    "No time to lose.",
    "Important see doctor for operation.",
    "She went into the kitchen where Judith Butler was making quince jelly.",
    "Judy said Mrs Oliver go and pack a few things.",

    "The car is ready.",
    "I brought it round to the front door.",
    "We can go at once.",
    "I dont think I want to take Miranda.",
    "I could leave her here with someone with the Reynolds or Rowena Drake.",
    "Mirandas coming too Mrs Oliver interrupted definitely.",
    "Dont make difficulties Judy.",
    "This is serious.",
    "I dont see\nhow you can even consider leaving her with the Reynolds.",
    "Two of the Reynolds children have been killed havent\nthey\nYes yes thats true enough.",
    "You think theres something wrong with that house.",
    "I mean theres someone there who\n oh what do I mean\nWere talking too much said Mrs Oliver.",
    "Anyway she said if anyone is going to be killed it seems to me that probably the most likely one would be Ann\nReynolds.",
    "Whats the matter with the family\nWhy should they all get killed one after another Oh Ariadne its frightening\nYes said Mrs Oliver but there are times when its quite right to be frightened.",
    "Ive just had a telegram and Im\nacting upon it.",
    "Oh I didnt hear the telephone.",
    "It didnt come through the telephone.",
    "It came to the door.",
    "She hesitated a moment then she held it out to her\nfriend.",
    "Whats this mean Operation\nTonsils probably said Mrs Oliver.",
    "Miranda had a bad throat last week hadnt she Well what more likely than\nthat she should be taken to consult a throat specialist in London\nAre you quite mad Ariadne\nProbably said Mrs Oliver raving mad.",
    "Come on.",
    "Miranda will enjoy being in London.",
    "You neednt worry.",
    "Shes\nnot going to have any operation.",
    "Thats whats called cover in spy stories.",
    "Well take her to a theatre or an opera or\nthe ballet whichever way her tastes lie.",
    "On the whole I think it would be best to take her to the ballet.",
    "Im frightened said Judith.",
    "Ariadne Oliver looked at her friend.",
    "She was trembling slightly.",
    "She looked more than ever Mrs Oliver thought like\nUndine.",
    "She looked divorced from reality.",
    "Come on said Mrs Oliver I promised Hercule Poirot Id bring you when he gave me the word.",
    "Well hes given\nme the word.",
    "Whats going on in this place said Judith.",
    "I cant think why I ever came here.",

    "She ran down the garden and disappeared through the gate.",
    "Who are Mirandas friends asked Mrs Oliver with some curiosity.",
    "I never really know said Judith.",
    "She never tells one things you know.",
    "Sometimes I think that the only things that\nshe really feels are her friends are the birds she looks at in the woods.",
    "Or squirrels or things like that.",
    "I think\neverybody likes her but I dont know that she has any particular friends.",
    "I mean she doesnt bring back girls to tea\nand things like that.",

    "Judith came downstairs again with a couple of\nsuitcases just as Miranda ran in through the side door somewhat out of breath.",
    "Arent we going to have lunch first she demanded.",
    "In spite of her elfin woodland appearance she was a healthy\nchild who liked her food.",
    "Well stop for lunch on the way said Mrs Oliver.",
    "Well stop at The Black Boy at Haversham.",
    "That would be about right.",
    "Its about threequarters of an hour from\n\n\fhere and they give you quite a good meal.",
    "Come on Miranda were going to start now.",
    "I shant have time to tell Cathie I cant go to the pictures with her tomorrow.",

    "Quite mad.",
    "Whats it all about\nWe shall know in due course I suppose said Mrs Oliver.",
    "I dont know if Im mad or he is.",
    "He Who\nHercule Poirot said Mrs Oliver.",
    "In London Hercule Poirot was sitting in a room with four other men.",
    "One was Inspector Timothy Raglan looking\nrespectful and pokerfaced as was his invariable habit when in the presence of his superiors the second was\nSuperintendent Spence.",
    "The third was Alfred Richmond Chief Constable of the County and the fourth was a man\nwith a sharp legal face from the Public Prosecutors office.",
    "They looked at Hercule Poirot with varying expressions\nor what one might describe as nonexpressions.",
    "You seem quite sure Monsieur Poirot.",
    "I am quite sure said Hercule Poirot.",
    "When a thing arranges itself so one realises that it must be so one only\nlooks for reasons why it should not be so.",
    "If one does not find the reasons why it should not be so then one is\nstrengthened in ones opinion.",
    "The motives seem somewhat complex if I may say so.",
    "No said Poirot not complex really.",
    "But so simple that they are very difficult to see clearly.",
    "The legal gentleman looked sceptical.",
    "We shall have one piece of definite evidence very soon now said Inspector Raglan.",
    "Of course if there has been a\nmistake on that point...\nDing dong dell no pussy in the well said Hercule Poirot.",
    "That is what you mean\nWell you must agree it is only a surmise on your part.",
    "The evidence pointed to it all along.",
    "When a girl disappears there are not many reasons.",
    "The first is that she has\ngone away with a man.",
    "The second is that she is dead.",
    "Anything else is very farfetched and practically never\nhappens.",
    "There are no other special points that you can bring to our attention Monsieur Poirot\nYes.",
    "I have been in touch with a well known firm of estate agents.",
    "Friends of mine who specialise in real estate in\nthe West Indies the Aegean the Adriatic the Mediterranean and other places.",
    "They specialise in sunshine and their\nclients are usually wealthy.",
    "Here is a recent purchase that might interest you.",
    "He handed over a folded paper.",
    "You think this ties up\n\n\fIm sure it does.",
    "I thought the sale of islands was prohibited by that particular government\nMoney can usually find a way.",
    "There is nothing else that you would care to dwell upon\nIt is possible that within twentyfour hours I shall have for you something that will more or less clinch matters.",
    "And what is that\nAn eyewitness.",
    "You mean \nAn eyewitness to a crime.",
    "The legal man looked at Poirot with mounting disbelief.",
    "Where is this eyewitness now\nOn the way to London I hope and trust.",
    "You sound disturbed.",
    "That is true.",
    "I have done what I can to take care of things but I will admit to you that I am frightened.",
    "Yes I am\nfrightened in spite of the protective measures I have taken.",
    "Because you see we are  how shall I describe it  we\nare up against ruthlessness quick reactions greed pushed beyond an expect able human limit and perhaps  I am not\nsure but I think it possible  a touch shall we say of madness Not there originally but cultivated.",
    "A seed that took\nroot and grows fast.",
    "And now perhaps has taken charge inspiring an inhuman rather than a human attitude to life.",
    "Well have to have a few extra opinions on this said the legal man.",
    "We cant rush into things.",
    "Of course a lot\ndepends on the  er  forgery business.",
    "If thats positive we can go ahead but if its negative wed have to think\nagain.",
    "Hercule Poirot rose to his feet.",
    "I will take my leave.",
    "I have told you all that I know and all that I fear and envisage as possible.",
    "I shall remain in\ntouch with you.",
    "He shook hands all round with foreign precision and went out.",
    "The mans a bit of a mountebank said the legal man.",
    "You dont think hes a bit touched do you Touched in the head himself I mean Anyway hes a pretty good age.",
    "I\ndont know that one can rely on the faculties of a man of that age.",
    "I think you can rely upon him said the Chief Constable.",
    "At least that is my impression.",
    "Spence Ive known you\na good many years.",
    "Youre a friend of his.",
    "Do you think hes become a little senile\nNo I dont said Superintendent Spence.",
    "Whats your opinion Raglan\nIve only met him recently sir.",
    "At first I thought his  well his way of talking his ideas might be fantastic.",
    "But on\nthe whole Im converted.",
    "I think hes going to be proved right.",
    "Chapter 24\nMrs Oliver had ensconced herself at a table in the window of The Black Boy.",
    "It was still fairly early so the diningroom was not very full.",
    "Presently Judith Butler returned from powdering her nose and sat down opposite her and\nexamined the menu.",

    "Three roast chickens Mrs Oliver ordered.",
    "She leaned back studying her friend.",
    "Why are you staring at me in that way\nI was thinking said Mrs Oliver.",
    "Thinking what\nThinking really how very little I knew about you.",
    "Well thats the same with everybody isnt it\nYou mean one never knows all about anyone.",
    "I shouldnt think so.",
    "Perhaps youre right said Mrs Oliver.",
    "Both women were silent for some time.",
    "Theyre rather slow serving things here.",
    "Its coming now I think said Mrs Oliver.",

    "She used to when she was younger.",
    "She returned some four or five minutes later.",
    "Shes not in the Ladies she said.",
    "Theres a door outside it into the garden.",

    "Shes like that.",

    "She went out at a small door\nthat enabled pedestrians to get into a lane outside.",
    "A little farther down the lane a car was parked.",

    "The car started went down the lane turned right turned left\nturned right again and came out on a secondary road.",
    "Were all right for time said the greybearded man.",
    "At the right moment youll see the double axe as it ought to\nbe seen.",
    "And Kilterbury Down too.",
    "Wonderful view.",
    "A car dashed past them so closely that they were almost forced into the hedge.",
    "Young idiots said the greybearded man.",
    "One of the young men had long hair reaching over his shoulders and large owlish spectacles.",
    "The other one affected\na more Spanish appearance with sideburns.",
    "You dont think Mummy will worry about me asked Miranda.",
    "She wont have time to worry about you.",
    "By the time she worries about you youll have got where you want to be.",
    "IV\nIn London Hercule Poirot picked up the telephone.",
    "Mrs Olivers voice came over.",
    "Weve lost Miranda.",
    "What do you mean lost her\nWe had lunch at The Black Boy.",
    "She went to the loo.",
    "She didnt come back.",
    "Somebody said they saw her driving\naway with an elderly man.",
    "But it mightnt have been her.",
    "It might have been someone else.",
    "It \nSomeone should have stayed with her.",
    "Neither of you ought to have let her out of your sight.",
    "I told you there was\ndanger.",
    "Is Mrs Butler very worried\n\n\fOf course shes worried.",
    "What do you think Shes frantic.",
    "She insists on ringing the police.",
    "Yes that would be the natural thing to do.",
    "I will ring them also.",
    "But why should Miranda be in danger\nDont you know You ought to by now.",
    "He added The bodys been found.",
    "Ive just heard \nWhat body\nA body in a well.",
    "Chapter 25\nThats beautiful said Miranda looking round her.",
    "Kilterbury Ring was a local beauty spot though its remains were\nnot particularly famous.",
    "They had been dismantled many hundreds of years ago.",
    "Yet here and there a tall megalithic\nstone still stood upright telling of a long past ritual worship.",
    "Miranda asked questions.",
    "Why did they have all these stones here\nFor ritual.",
    "Ritual worship.",
    "Ritual sacrifice.",
    "You understand about sacrifice dont you Miranda\nI think so.",
    "It has to be you see.",
    "Its important.",
    "You mean its not a sort of punishment Its something else\nYes its something else.",
    "You die so that others should live.",
    "You die so that beauty should live.",
    "Should come into\nbeing.",
    "Thats the important thing.",
    "I thought perhaps \nYes Miranda\nI thought perhaps you ought to die because what youve done has killed someone else.",
    "What put that into your head\nI was thinking of Joyce.",
    "If I hadnt told her about something she wouldnt have died would she\nPerhaps not.",
    "Ive felt worried since Joyce died.",
    "I neednt have told her need I I told her because I wanted to have something\nworth while telling her.",
    "Shed been to India and she kept talking about it  about the tigers and about the elephants\nand their gold hangings and decorations and their trappings.",
    "And I think too  suddenly I wanted somebody else to\nknow because you see I hadnt really thought about it before.",
    "She added Was  was that a sacrifice too\nIn a way.",
    "Miranda remained contemplative then she said Isnt it time yet\nThe sun is not quite right yet.",
    "Another five minutes perhaps and then it will fall directly on the stone.",
    "Again they sat silent beside the car.",
    "Now I think said Mirandas companion looking up at the sky where the sun was dipping towards the horizon.",
    "Now is a wonderful moment.",
    "No one here.",
    "Nobody comes up at this time of day and walks up to the top of\nKilterbury Down to see Kilterbury Ring.",
    "Too cold in November and the blackberries are over.",
    "Ill show you the\n\n\fdouble axe first.",
    "The double axe on the stone.",
    "Carved there when they came from Mycenae or from Crete hundreds\nof years ago.",
    "Its wonderful Miranda isnt it\nYes its very wonderful said Miranda.",
    "Show it to me.",
    "They walked up to the topmost stone.",
    "Beside it lay a fallen one and a little farther down the slope a slightly inclined one leant as though bent with the\nweariness of years.",
    "Are you happy Miranda\nYes Im very happy.",
    "Theres the sign here.",
    "Is that really the double axe\nYes its worn with time but thats it.",
    "Thats the symbol.",
    "Put your hand on it.",
    "And now  now we will drink to the\npast and the future and to beauty.",
    "Oh how lovely said Miranda.",
    "A golden cup was put into her hand and from a flask her companion poured a golden liquid into it.",
    "It tastes of fruit of peaches.",
    "Drink it Miranda and you will be happier still.",
    "Miranda took the gilt cup.",
    "She sniffed at it.",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes it does smell of peaches.",
    "Oh look theres the sun.",
    "Really red gold looking as though it was lying on the\nedge of the world.",
    "He turned her towards it.",
    "Hold up the cup and drink.",
    "She turned obediently.",
    "One hand was still on the megalithic stone and its semi erased sign.",
    "Her companion now was\nstanding behind her.",
    "From below the inclined stone down the hill two figures slipped out bent half double.",
    "Those\non the summit had their backs to them and did not even notice them.",
    "Quickly but stealthily they ran up the hill.",
    "Drink to beauty Miranda.",
    "Like hell she does said a voice behind them.",
    "A rose velvet coat shot over a head a knife was knocked from the hand that was slowly rising.",
    "Nicholas Ransom\ncaught hold of Miranda clasping her tightly and dragging her away from the other two who were struggling.",
    "You bloody little idiot said Nicholas Ransom.",
    "Coming up here with a barmy murderer.",
    "You should have known\nwhat you were doing.",
    "I did in a way said Miranda.",
    "I was going to be a sacrifice I think because you see it was all my fault.",
    "It was\nbecause of me that Joyce was killed.",
    "So it was right for me to be a sacrifice wasnt it It would be a kind of ritual\nkilling.",
    "Dont start talking nonsense about ritual killings.",
    "Theyve found that other girl.",
    "You know the au pair girl who has\nbeen missing so long.",
    "A couple of years or something like that.",
    "They all thought shed run away because shed\nforged a Will.",
    "She hadnt run away.",
    "Her body was found in the well.",
    "Oh Miranda gave a sudden cry of anguish.",
    "Not in the wishing well Not in the wishing well that I wanted to find\nso badly Oh I dont want her to be in the wishing well.",
    "Who  who put her there\nThe same person who brought you here.",
    "Chapter 26\nOnce again four men sat looking at Poirot.",
    "Timothy Raglan Superintendent Spence and the Chief Constable had the\npleased expectant look of a cat who is counting on a saucer of cream to materialise at any moment.",
    "The fourth man\nstill had the expression of one who suspends belief.",
    "Well Monsieur Poirot said the Chief Constable taking charge of the proceedings and leaving the DPP man to\nhold a watching brief.",
    "Were all here  Poirot made a motion with his hand.",
    "Inspector Raglan left the room and returned ushering in a\nwoman of thirty odd a girl and two adolescent young men.",
    "He introduced them to the Chief Constable.",
    "Mrs Butler Miss Miranda Butler Mr Nicholas Ransom and Mr Desmond Holland.",
    "Poirot got up and took\nMirandas hand.",
    "Sit here by your mother Miranda  Mr Richmond here who is what is called a Chief Constable wants to ask you\nsome questions.",
    "He wants you to answer them.",
    "It concerns something you saw  over a year ago now nearer two\nyears.",
    "You mention this to one person and so I understand to one person only.",
    "Is that correct\nI told Joyce.",
    "And what exactly did you tell Joyce\nThat Id seen a murder.",
    "Did you tell anyone else\nNo.",
    "But I think Leopold guessed.",
    "He listens you know.",
    "At doors.",
    "That sort of thing.",
    "He likes knowing peoples\nsecrets.",
    "You have heard that Joyce Reynolds on the afternoon before the Halloween party claimed that she herself had\nseen a murder committed.",
    "Was that true\nNo.",
    "She was just repeating what Id told her  but pretending that it had happened to her.",
    "Will you tell us now just what you did see.",
    "I didnt know at first that it was a murder.",
    "I thought there had been an accident.",
    "I thought shed fallen from up above\nsomewhere.",
    "Where was this\nIn the Quarry Garden in the hollow where the fountain used to be.",
    "I was up in the branches of a tree.",
    "Id been\nlooking at a squirrel and one has to keep very quiet or they rush away.",
    "Squirrels are very quick.",
    "Tell us what you saw.",
    "A man and a woman lifted her up and were carrying her up the path.",
    "I thought they were taking her to a hospital or\nto the Quarry House.",
    "Then the woman stopped suddenly and said Someone is watching us and stared at my tree.",
    "Somehow it made me feel frightened.",
    "I kept very still.",
    "The man said Nonsense\nand they went on.",
    "I saw there was blood on a scarf and there was a knife with blood on that and I thought perhaps\nsomeone had tried to kill themselves and I went on keeping very still.",
    "Because you were frightened\nYes but I dont know why.",
    "You didnt tell your mother\nNo.",
    "I thought perhaps I oughtnt to have been there watching.",
    "And then the next day nobody said anything about an\naccident so I forgot about it.",
    "I never thought about it again until  She stopped suddenly.",
    "The Chief Constable\nopened his mouth  then shut it.",
    "He looked at Poirot and made a very slight gesture.",
    "Yes Miranda said Poirot until what\nIt was as though it was happening all over again.",
    "It was a green woodpecker this time and I was being very still\nwatching it from behind some bushes.",
    "And those two were sitting there talking  about an island  a Greek island.",
    "She said something like Its all signed up.",
    "Its ours we can go to it whenever we like.",
    "But wed better go slow still not rush things.",
    "And then the woodpecker flew away and I moved.",
    "And she said Hush  be quiet  somebodys\nwatching us.",
    "It was just the way shed said it before and she had just the same look on her face and I was frightened again and I\nremembered.",
    "And this time I knew.",
    "I knew it had been a murder I had seen and it had been a dead body they were\ncarrying away to hide somewhere.",
    "You see I wasnt a child any more.",
    "I knew  things and what they must mean the\nblood and the knife and the dead body all limp \nWhen was this asked the Chief Constable.",
    "How long ago Miranda thought for a moment.",
    "Last March just after Easter.",
    "Can you say definitely who these people were Miranda\nOf course I can.",
    "Miranda looked bewildered.",
    "You saw their faces\nOf course.",
    "Who were they\nMrs Drake and Michael...",
    "It was not a dramatic denunciation.",
    "Her voice was quiet with something in it like wonder but it carried conviction.",
    "The Chief Constable said You did not tell anyone.",
    "Why not\nI thought  I thought it might have been a sacrifice.",
    "Who told you that\nMichael told me.",
    "He said sacrifices were necessary.",
    "Poirot said gently You loved Michael\nOh yes said Miranda I loved him very much.",
    "Chapter 27\nNow Ive got you here at last said Mrs Oliver I want to know all about everything.",
    "She looked at Poirot with determination and asked severely\nWhy havent you come sooner\nMy excuses Madame I have been much occupied assisting the police with their inquiries.",
    "Its criminals who do that.",
    "What on earth made you think of Rowena Drake being mixed up in a murder Nobody\nelse would have dreamed of it\nIt was simple as soon as I got the vital clue.",
    "What do you call the vital clue\nWater.",
    "I wanted someone who was at the party and who was wet and who shouldnt have been wet.",
    "Whoever killed\nJoyce Reynolds would necessarily have got wet.",
    "You hold down a vigorous child with its head in a full bucket of\nwater and there will be struggling and splashing and you are bound to be wet.",
    "So something has got to happen to\nprovide an innocent explanation of how you got wet.",
    "When everyone crowded into the diningroom for the\nSnapdragon Mrs Drake took Joyce with her to the library.",
    "If your hostess asks you to come with her naturally you\ngo.",
    "And certainly Joyce had no suspicion of Mrs Drake.",
    "All Miranda had told her was that she had once seen a\nmurder committed.",
    "And so Joyce was killed and her murderer was fairly well soaked with water.",
    "There must be a\nreason for that and she set about creating a reason.",
    "She had to get a witness as to how she got wet.",
    "She waited on the\nlanding with an enormous vase of flowers filled with water.",
    "In due course Miss Whittaker came out from the\nSnapdragon room  it was hot in there.",
    "Mrs Drake pretended to start nervously and let the vase go taking care that it\nflooded her person as it crashed down to the hall below.",
    "She ran down the stairs and she and Miss Whittaker picked\nup the pieces and the flowers while Mrs Drake complained at the loss of her beautiful vase.",
    "She managed to give\nMiss Whittaker the impression that she had seen something or someone coming out of the room where a murder had\nbeen committed.",
    "Miss Whittaker took the statement at its face value but when she mentioned it to Miss Emlyn\nMiss Emlyn realised the really interesting thing about it.",
    "And so she urged Miss Whittaker to tell me the story.",
    "And so said Poirot twirling his moustaches I too knew who the murderer of Joyce was.",
    "And all the time Joyce had never seen any murder committed at all\nMrs Drake did not know that.",
    "But she had always suspected that someone had been there in the Quarry Wood when\nshe and Michael Garfield had killed Olga Seminoff and might have seen it happen.",
    "When did you know it had been Miranda and not Joyce\nAs soon as common sense forced me to accept the universal verdict that Joyce was a liar.",
    "Then Miranda was clearly\nindicated.",
    "She was frequently in the Quarry Wood observing birds and squirrels.",
    "Joyce was as Miranda told me her\nbest friend.",
    "She said We tell each other everything.",
    "Miranda was not at the party so the compulsive liar Joyce\ncould use the story her friend her told her of having once seen a murder committed  probably in order to impress\nyou Madame the wellknown crime writer.",
    "Thats right blame it all on me.",
    "No no.",
    "Rowena Drake mused Mrs Oliver.",
    "I still cant believe it of her.",
    "She had all the qualities necessary.",
    "I have always wondered he added\nexactly what sort of a woman Lady Macbeth was.",
    "What would she be like if you met her in real life Well I think I\nhave met her.",
    "And Michael Garfield They seem such an unlikely pair.",
    "Interesting  Lady Macbeth and Narcissus an unusual combination.",
    "Lady Macbeth Mrs Oliver murmured thoughtfully.",
    "She was a handsome woman  efficient and competent  a born administrator  an unexpectedly good actress.",
    "You\nshould have heard her lamenting over the death of the little boy Leopold and weeping large sobs into a dry\nhandkerchief.",
    "Disgusting.",
    "You remember I asked you who in your opinion were or were not nice people.",
    "Was Michael Garfield in love with her\nI doubt if Michael Garfield has ever loved anyone but himself.",
    "He wanted money\n a lot of money.",
    "Perhaps he believed at first he could influence Mrs LlewellynSmythe to dote upon him to the\nextent of making a Will in his favour  but Mrs LlewellynSmythe was not that kind of woman.",
    "What about the forgery I still dont understand that.",
    "What was the point of it all\nIt was confusing at first.",
    "Too much forgery one might say.",
    "But if one considered it the purpose of it was clear.",
    "You had only to consider what actually happened.",
    "Mrs LlewellynSmythes fortune all went to Rowena Drake.",
    "The codicil produced was so obviously forged that any\nlawyer would spot it.",
    "It would be contested and the evidence of experts would result in its being upset and the\noriginal Will would stand.",
    "As Rowena Drakes husband had recently died she would inherit everything.",
    "But what about the codicil that the cleaning woman witnessed\nMy surmise is that Mrs LlewellynSmythe discovered that Michael Garfield and Rowena Drake were having an\naffair  probably before her husband died.",
    "In her anger Mrs LlewellynSmythe made a codicil to her Will leaving\neverything to her au pair girl.",
    "Probably the girl told Michael about this  she was hoping to marry him.",
    "I thought it was young Ferrier\nThat was a plausible tale told me by Michael.",
    "There was no confirmation of it.",
    "Then if he knew there was a real codicil why didnt he marry Olga and get hold of the money that way\nBecause he doubted whether she really would get the money.",
    "There is such a thing as undue influence.",
    "Mrs\nLlewellynSmythe was an elderly woman and a sick woman also.",
    "All her preceding Wills had been in favour of her\nown kith and kin  good sensible Wills such as law courts approve of.",
    "This girl from foreign parts had been known\nto her only a year  and had no kind of claim upon her.",
    "That codicil even though genuine could have been upset.",
    "Besides I doubt if Olga could have put through the purchase of a Greek island  or would even have been willing to\ndo so.",
    "She had no influential friends or contacts in business circles.",
    "She was attracted to Michael but she looked\nupon him as a good prospect matrimonially who would enable her to live in England  which is what she wanted to\ndo.",
    "And Rowena Drake\nShe was infatuated.",
    "Her husband had been for many years a crippled invalid.",
    "She was middleaged but she was a\npassionate woman and into her orbit came a young man of unusual beauty.",
    "Women fell for him easily  but he\nwanted  not the beauty of women  but the exercise of his own creative urge to make beauty.",
    "For that he wanted\nmoney  a lot of money.",
    "As for love  he loved only himself.",
    "He was Narcissus.",
    "There is an old French song I heard\nmany years ago  He hummed softly.",
    "Regarde Narcisse\nRegarde dans leau...\nRegarde Narcisse\nque tu es beau\nIl ny au monde\n\n\fQue la Beaut\u00e9\nEt la Jeunesse\nHelas Et la Jeunesse...\nRegarde Narcisse\nRegarde dans leau...",
    "I cant believe  I simply cant believe that anyone would do murder just to make a garden on a Greek island said\nMrs Oliver unbelievingly.",
    "Cant you Cant you visualise how he held it in his mind Bare rock perhaps but so shaped as to hold possibilities.",
    "Earth cargoes of fertile earth to clothe the bare bones of the rocks  and then plants seeds shrubs trees.",
    "Perhaps he\nread in the paper of a shipping millionaire who had created an island garden for the woman he loved.",
    "And so it came\nto him  he would make a garden not for a woman but  for himself.",
    "It still seems to me quite mad.",
    "Yes.",
    "That happens.",
    "I doubt if he even thought of his motive as sordid.",
    "He thought of it only as necessary for the\ncreation of more beauty.",
    "Hed gone mad on creation.",
    "The beauty of the Quarry Wood the beauty of other gardens\nhed laid out and made  and now he envisaged even more  a whole island of beauty.",
    "And there was Rowena Drake\ninfatuated with him.",
    "What did she mean to him but the source of money with which he could create beauty.",
    "Yes  he\nhad become mad perhaps.",
    "Whom the gods destroy they first drive mad.",
    "He really wanted his island so much Even with Rowena Drake tied round his neck as well Bossing him the whole\ntime\nAccidents can happen.",
    "I think one might possibly have happened to Mrs Drake in due course.",
    "One more murder\nYes.",
    "It started simply.",
    "Olga had to be removed because she knew about the codicil  and she was also to be the\nscapegoat branded as a forger.",
    "Mrs LlewellynSmythe had hidden the original document so I think that young\nFerrier was given money to produce a similar forged document.",
    "So obviously forged that it would arouse suspicion\nat once.",
    "That sealed his death warrant.",
    "Lesley Ferrier I soon decided had had no arrangement or love affair with\nOlga.",
    "That was a suggestion made to me by Michael Garfield but I think it was Michael who paid money to Lesley.",
    "It was Michael Garfield who was laying siege to the au pair girls affections warning her to keep quiet about this\nand not tell her employer speaking of possible marriage in the future but at the same time marking her down\ncoldbloodedly as the victim whom he and Rowena Drake would need if the money was to come to them.",
    "It was not\nnecessary for Olga Seminoff to be accused of forgery or prosecuted.",
    "She needed only to be suspected of it.",
    "The\nforgery appeared to benefit her.",
    "It could have been done by her very easily there was evidence to the effect that she\ndid copy her employers handwriting and if she was suddenly to disappear it would be assumed that she had been\nnot only a forger but quite possibly might have assisted her employer to die suddenly.",
    "So on a suitable occasion\nOlga Seminoff died.",
    "Lesley Ferrier was killed in what is purported to have been a gang knifing or a knifing by a\njealous woman.",
    "But the knife that was found in the well corresponds very closely with the knife wounds that he\nsuffered.",
    "I knew that Olgas body must be hidden somewhere in this neighbourhood but I had no idea where until I\nheard Miranda one day inquiring about a wishing well urging Michael Garfield to take her there.",
    "And he was\nrefusing.",
    "Shortly afterwards when I was talking to Mrs Goodbody I said I wondered where that girl had disappeared\ntoo and she said\nDing dong dell pussys in the well and then I was quite sure the girls body was in the wishing well.",
    "I discovered it\nwas in the wood in the Quarry Wood on an incline not far from Michael Garfields cottage and I thought that\nMiranda could have seen either the actual murder or the disposal of the body later.",
    "Mrs Drake and Michael feared\nthat someone had been a witness  but they had no idea who it was  and as nothing happened they were lulled into\nsecurity.",
    "They made their plans  they were in no hurry but they set things in motion.",
    "She talked about buying land\nabroad  gave people the idea she wanted to get away from Woodleigh Common.",
    "Too many sad associations\n\n\freferring always to her grief over her husbands death.",
    "Everything was nicely in train and then came the shock of\nHalloween and Joyces sudden assertion of having witnessed a murder.",
    "So now Rowena knew or thought she knew\nwho it had been in the wood that day.",
    "So she acted quickly.",
    "But there was more to come.",
    "Young Leopold asked for\nmoney  there were things he wanted to buy he said.",
    "What he guessed or knew is uncertain but he was Joyces\nbrother and so they probably thought he knew far more than he really did.",
    "And so  he too died.",
    "You suspected her because of the water clue said Mrs Oliver.",
    "How did you come to suspect Michael Garfield\nHe fitted said Poirot simply.",
    "And then  the last time I spoke to Michael Garfield I was sure.",
    "He said to me\nlaughing  Get thee beyond me Satan.",
    "Go and join your police friends.",
    "And I knew then quite certainly.",
    "It was the\nother way round.",
    "I said to myself I am leaving you behind me Satan A Satan young and beautiful as Lucifer can\nappear to mortals...",
    "There was another woman in the room until now she had not spoken but now she stirred in her\nchair.",
    "Lucifer she said.",
    "Yes I see now.",
    "He was always that.",
    "He was very beautiful said Poirot and he loved beauty.",
    "The beauty that he made with his brain and his\nimagination and his hands.",
    "To it he would sacrifice everything.",
    "In his own way I think he loved the child Miranda\nbut he was ready to sacrifice her to save himself.",
    "He planned her death very carefully he made of it a ritual and as\none might put it indoctrinated her with the idea.",
    "She was to let him know if she were leaving Woodleigh Common\nhe instructed her to meet him at the Inn where you and Mrs Oliver lunched.",
    "She was to have been found on\nKilterbury Ring there by the sign of the double axe with a golden goblet by her side a ritual sacrifice.",
    "Mad said Judith Butler.",
    "He must have been mad.",
    "Madame your daughter is safe but there is something I would like to know very much.",
    "I think you deserve to know anything I can tell you Monsieur Poirot.",
    "She is your daughter  was she also Michael Garfields daughter Judith was silent for a moment and then she\nsaid Yes.",
    "But she doesnt know that\nNo.",
    "She has no idea.",
    "Meeting him here was a pure coincidence.",
    "I knew him when I was a young girl.",
    "I fell wildly in\nlove with him and then  and then I got afraid.",
    "Afraid\nYes.",
    "I dont know why.",
    "Not of anything he would do or that sort of thing just afraid of his nature.",
    "His gentleness\nbut behind it a coldness and a ruthlessness.",
    "I was even afraid of his passion for beauty and for creation in his work.",
    "I\ndidnt tell him I was going to have a child.",
    "I left him  I went away and the baby was born.",
    "I invented the story of a\npilot husband who had had a crash.",
    "I moved about rather restlessly.",
    "I came to Woodleigh Common more or less by\nchance.",
    "I had got contacts in Medchester where I could find secretarial work.",
    "And then one day Michael Garfield came here to work in the Quarry Wood.",
    "I dont think I minded.",
    "Nor did he.",
    "All\nthat was over long ago but later although I didnt realise how often Miranda went there to the Wood I did worry \nYes said Poirot there was a bond between them.",
    "A natural affinity.",
    "I saw the likeness between them  only\nMichael Garfield the follower of Lucifer the beautiful was evil and your daughter has innocence and wisdom and\nthere is no evil in her.",
    "He went over to his desk and brought back an envelope.",
    "Out of it he drew a delicate pencil drawing.",
    "Your daughter he said.",
    "Judith looked at it.",
    "It was signed Michael Garfield.",
    "He was drawing her by the stream said Poirot in the Quarry Wood.",
    "He drew it he said so that he should not\nforget.",
    "He was afraid of forgetting.",
    "It wouldnt have stopped him killing her though.",
    "Then he pointed to be pencilled word across the top left hand corner.",
    "Can you read that\nShe spelt it out slowly.",
    "Iphigenia.",
    "Yes said Poirot Iphigenia.",
    "Agamemnon sacrificed his daughter so that he should get a wind to take his ships to\nTroy.",
    "Michael would have sacrificed his daughter so that he should have a new Garden of Eden.",
    "He knew what he was doing said Judith.",
