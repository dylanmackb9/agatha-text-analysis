    "\fDead Mans Folly\n\n\f\fChapter 1\nIt was Miss Lemon Poirots efficient secretary who took the telephone\ncall.",
    "Laying aside her shorthand notebook she raised the receiver and said\nwithout emphasis \u201cTrafalgar 8137.\u201d\nHercule Poirot leaned back in his upright chair and closed his eyes.",
    "His\nfingers beat a meditative soft tattoo on the edge of the table.",
    "In his head he\ncontinued to compose the polished periods of the letter he had been\ndictating.",
    "Placing her hand over the receiver Miss Lemon asked in a low voice\n\u201cWill you accept a personal call from Nassecombe Devon\u201d\nPoirot frowned.",
    "The place meant nothing to him.",
    "\u201cThe name of the caller\u201d he demanded cautiously.",
    "Miss Lemon spoke into the mouthpiece.",
    "\u201cAirraid\u201d she asked doubtingly.",
    "\u201cOh yes  what was the last name\nagain\u201d\nOnce more she turned to Hercule Poirot.",
    "\u201cMrs Ariadne Oliver.\u201d\nHercule Poirots eyebrows shot up.",
    "A memory rose in his mind\nwindswept grey hair... an eagle profile...",
    "He rose and replaced Miss Lemon at the telephone.",
    "\u201cHercule Poirot speaks\u201d he announced grandiloquently.",
    "\u201cIs that Mr Hercules Porrot speaking personally\u201d the suspicious voice\nof the telephone operator demanded.",
    "Poirot assured her that that was the case.",
    "\u201cYoure through to Mr Porrot\u201d said the voice.",
    "Its thin reedy accents were replaced by a magnificent booming contralto\nwhich caused Poirot hastily to shift the receiver a couple of inches farther\nfrom his ear.",
    "\u201cM.",
    "Poirot is that really you\u201d demanded Mrs Oliver.",
    "\u201cMyself in person Madame.\u201d\n\u201cThis is Mrs Oliver.",
    "I dont know if youll remember me \u201d\n\u201cBut of course I remember you Madame.",
    "Who could forget you\u201d\n\u201cWell people do sometimes\u201d said Mrs Oliver.",
    "\u201cQuite often in fact.",
    "I\ndont think that Ive got a very distinctive personality.",
    "Or perhaps its\nbecause Im always doing different things to my hair.",
    "But all thats neither\n\n\fhere nor there.",
    "I hope Im not interrupting you when youre frightfully\nbusy\u201d\n\u201cNo no you do not derange me in the least.\u201d\n\u201cGood gracious  Im sure I dont want to drive you out of your mind.",
    "The fact is I need you.\u201d\n\u201cNeed me\u201d\n\u201cYes at once.",
    "Can you take an aeroplane\u201d\n\u201cI do not take aeroplanes.",
    "They make me sick.\u201d\n\u201cThey do me too.",
    "Anyway I dont suppose it would be any quicker than\nthe train really because I think the only airport near here is Exeter which is\nmiles away.",
    "So come by train.",
    "Twelve oclock from Paddington to\nNassecombe.",
    "You can do it nicely.",
    "Youve got threequarters of an hour if\nmy watch is right  though it isnt usually.\u201d\n\u201cBut where are you Madame What is all this about\u201d\n\u201cNasse House Nassecombe.",
    "A car or taxi will meet you at the station at\nNassecombe.\u201d\n\u201cBut why do you need me What is all this about\u201d Poirot repeated\nfrantically.",
    "\u201cTelephones are in such awkward places\u201d said Mrs Oliver.",
    "\u201cThis ones\nin the hall... People passing through and talking...",
    "I cant really hear.",
    "But Im\nexpecting you.",
    "Everybody will be so thrilled.",
    "Goodbye.\u201d\nThere was a sharp click as the receiver was replaced.",
    "The line hummed\ngently.",
    "With a baffled air of bewilderment Poirot put back the receiver and\nmurmured something under his breath.",
    "Miss Lemon sat with her pencil\npoised incurious.",
    "She repeated in muted tones the final phrase of dictation\nbefore the interruption.",
    "\u201c allow me to assure you my dear sir that the hypothesis you have\nadvanced...\u201d\nPoirot waved aside the advancement of the hypothesis.",
    "\u201cThat was Mrs Oliver\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cAriadne Oliver the detective novelist.",
    "You may have read...\u201d But he stopped remembering that Miss Lemon only\nread improving books and regarded such frivolities as fictional crime with\ncontempt.",
    "\u201cShe wants me to go down to Devonshire today at once in \u201d he\nglanced at the clock  \u201cthirtyfive minutes.\u201d\nMiss Lemon raised disapproving eyebrows.",
    "\u201cThat will be running it rather fine\u201d she said.",
    "\u201cFor what reason\u201d\n\n\f\u201cYou may well ask She did not tell me.\u201d\n\u201cHow very peculiar.",
    "Why not\u201d\n\u201cBecause\u201d said Hercule Poirot thoughtfully \u201cshe was afraid of being\noverheard.",
    "Yes she made that quite clear.\u201d\n\u201cWell really\u201d said Miss Lemon bristling in her employers defence.",
    "\u201cThe things people expect Fancy thinking that youd go rushing off on\nsome wild goose chase like that An important man like you I have always\nnoticed that these artists and writers are very unbalanced  no sense of\nproportion.",
    "Shall I telephone through a telegram Regret unable leave\nLondon\u201d\nHer hand went out to the telephone.",
    "Poirots voice arrested the gesture.",
    "\u201cDu tout\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cOn the contrary.",
    "Be so kind as to summon a taxi\nimmediately.\u201d He raised his voice.",
    "\u201cGeorges A few necessities of toilet in\nmy small valise.",
    "And quickly very quickly I have a train to catch.\u201d\n\n\fDead Mans Folly\nII\nThe train having done one hundred and eightyodd miles of its two\nhundred and twelve miles journey at top speed puffed gently and\napologetically through the last thirty and drew into Nassecombe station.",
    "Only one person alighted Hercule Poirot.",
    "He negotiated with care a\nyawning gap between the step of the train and the platform and looked\nround him.",
    "At the far end of the train a porter was busy inside a luggage\ncompartment.",
    "Poirot picked up his valise and walked back along the\nplatform to the exit.",
    "He gave up his ticket and walked out through the\nbookingoffice.",
    "A large Humber saloon was drawn up outside and a chauffeur in\nuniform came forward.",
    "\u201cMr Hercule Poirot\u201d he inquired respectfully.",
    "He took Poirots case from him and opened the door of the car.",
    "They\ndrove away from the station over the railway bridge and turned down a\ncountry lane which wound between high hedges on either side.",
    "Presently\nthe ground fell away on the right and disclosed a very beautiful river view\nwith hills of a misty blue in the distance.",
    "The chauffeur drew into the hedge\nand stopped.",
    "\u201cThe River Helm sir\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cWith Dartmoor in the distance.\u201d\nIt was clear that admiration was necessary.",
    "Poirot made the necessary\nnoises murmuring Magnifique several times.",
    "Actually Nature appealed to\nhim very little.",
    "A wellcultivated neatly arranged kitchen garden was far\nmore likely to bring a murmur of admiration to Poirots lips.",
    "Two girls\npassed the car toiling slowly up the hill.",
    "They were carrying heavy\nrucksacks on their backs and wore shorts with bright coloured scarves tied\nover their heads.",
    "\u201cThere is a Youth Hostel next door to us sir\u201d explained the chauffeur\nwho had clearly constituted himself Poirots guide to Devon.",
    "\u201cHoodown\nPark.",
    "Mr Fletchers place it used to be.",
    "This Youth Hostel Association\nbought it and its fairly crammed in summer time.",
    "Take in over a hundred a\n\n\fnight they do.",
    "Theyre not allowed to stay longer than a couple of nights then theyve got to move on.",
    "Both sexes and mostly foreigners.\u201d\nPoirot nodded absently.",
    "He was reflecting not for the first time that\nseen from the back shorts were becoming to very few of the female sex.",
    "He\nshut his eyes in pain.",
    "Why oh why must young women array themselves\nthus Those scarlet thighs were singularly unattractive\n\u201cThey seem heavily laden\u201d he murmured.",
    "\u201cYes sir and its a long pull from the station or the bus stop.",
    "Best part\nof two miles to Hoodown Park.\u201d He hesitated.",
    "\u201cIf you dont object sir we\ncould give them a lift\u201d\n\u201cBy all means by all means\u201d said Poirot benignantly.",
    "There was he in\nluxury in an almost empty car and here were these two panting and\nperspiring young women weighed down with heavy rucksacks and without\nthe least idea how to dress themselves so as to appear attractive to the other\nsex.",
    "The chauffeur started the car and came to a slow purring halt beside the\ntwo girls.",
    "Their flushed and perspiring faces were raised hopefully.",
    "Poirot opened the door and the girls climbed in.",
    "\u201cIt is most kind please\u201d said one of them a fair girl with a foreign\naccent.",
    "\u201cIt is longer way than I think yes.\u201d\nThe other girl who had a sunburnt and deeply flushed face with\nbronzed chestnut curls peeping out beneath her headscarf merely nodded\nher head several times flashed her teeth and murmured Grazie.",
    "The fair\ngirl continued to talk vivaciously.",
    "\u201cI to England come for two week holiday.",
    "I come from Holland.",
    "I like\nEngland very much.",
    "I have been Stratford Avon Shakespeare Theatre and\nWarwick Castle.",
    "Then I have been Clovelly now I have seen Exeter\nCathedral and Torquay  very nice  I come to famous beauty spot here and\ntomorrow I cross river go to Plymouth where discovery of New World was\nmade from Plymouth Hoe.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you signorina\u201d Poirot turned to the other girl.",
    "But she only\nsmiled and shook her curls.",
    "\u201cShe does not much English speak\u201d said the Dutch girl kindly.",
    "\u201cWe\nboth a little French speak  so we talk in train.",
    "She is coming from near\nMilan and has relative in England married to gentleman who keeps shop for\nmuch groceries.",
    "She has come with friend to Exeter yesterday but friend\nhas eat veal ham pie not good from shop in Exeter and has to stay there\nsick.",
    "It is not good in hot weather the veal ham pie.\u201d\n\n\fAt this point the chauffeur slowed down where the road forked.",
    "The\ngirls got out uttered thanks in two languages and proceeded up the lefthand road.",
    "The chauffeur laid aside for a moment his Olympian aloofness\nand said feelingly to Poirot\n\u201cIts not only veal and ham pie  you want to be careful of Cornish\npasties too.",
    "Put anything in a pasty they will holiday time\u201d\nHe restarted the car and drove down the righthand road which shortly\nafterwards passed into thick woods.",
    "He proceeded to give a final verdict on\nthe occupants of Hoodown Park Youth Hostel.",
    "\u201cNice enough young women some of em at that hostel\u201d he said \u201cbut\nits hard to get them to understand about trespassing.",
    "Absolutely shocking\nthe way they trespass.",
    "Dont seem to understand that a gentlemans place is\nprivate here.",
    "Always coming through our woods they are and pretending\nthat they dont understand what you say to them.\u201d He shook his head darkly.",
    "They went on down a steep hill through woods then through big iron\ngates and along a drive winding up finally in front of a big white Georgian\nhouse looking out over the river.",
    "The chauffeur opened the door of the car as a tall blackhaired butler\nappeared on the steps.",
    "\u201cMr Hercule Poirot\u201d murmured the latter.",
    "\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cMrs Oliver is expecting you sir.",
    "You will find her down at the Battery.",
    "Allow me to show you the way.\u201d\nPoirot was directed to a winding path that led along the wood with\nglimpses of the river below.",
    "The path descended gradually until it came out\nat last on an open space round in shape with a low battlemented parapet.",
    "On the parapet Mrs Oliver was sitting.",
    "She rose to meet him and several apples fell from her lap and rolled in\nall directions.",
    "Apples seemed to be an inescapable motif of meeting Mrs\nOliver.",
    "\u201cI cant think why I always drop things\u201d said Mrs Oliver somewhat\nindistinctly since her mouth was full of apple.",
    "\u201cHow are you M. Poirot\u201d\n\u201cTr\u00e8s bien ch\u00e8re Madame\u201d replied Poirot politely.",
    "\u201cAnd you\u201d\nMrs Oliver was looking somewhat different from when Poirot had last\nseen her and the reason lay as she had already hinted over the telephone in\nthe fact that she had once more experimented with her coiffure.",
    "The last\ntime Poirot had seen her she had been adopting a windswept effect.",
    "Today\n\n\fher hair richly blued was piled upward in a multiplicity of rather artificial\nlittle curls in a pseudo Marquise style.",
    "The Marquise effect ended at her\nneck the rest of her could have been definitely labelled \u201ccountry practical\u201d\nconsisting of a violent yolkofegg rough tweed coat and skirt and a rather\nbiliouslooking mustardcoloured jumper.",
    "\u201cI knew youd come\u201d said Mrs Oliver cheerfully.",
    "\u201cYou could not possibly have known\u201d said Poirot severely.",
    "\u201cOh yes I did.\u201d\n\u201cI still ask myself why I am here.\u201d\n\u201cWell I know the answer.",
    "Curiosity.\u201d\nPoirot looked at her and his eyes twinkled a little.",
    "\u201cYour famous\nwomans intuition\u201d he said \u201chas perhaps for once not led you too far\nastray.\u201d\n\u201cNow dont laugh at my womans intuition.",
    "Havent I always spotted the\nmurderer right away\u201d\nPoirot was gallantly silent.",
    "Otherwise he might have replied \u201cAt the\nfifth attempt perhaps and not always then\u201d\nInstead he said looking round him\n\u201cIt is indeed a beautiful property that you have here.\u201d\n\u201cThis But it doesnt belong to me M. Poirot.",
    "Did you think it did Oh\nno it belongs to some people called Stubbs.\u201d\n\u201cWho are they\u201d\n\u201cOh nobody really\u201d said Mrs Oliver vaguely.",
    "\u201cJust rich.",
    "No Im down\nhere professionally doing a job.\u201d\n\u201cAh you are getting local colour for one of your chefsdoeuvre\u201d\n\u201cNo no.",
    "Just what I said.",
    "Im doing a job.",
    "Ive been engaged to arrange\na murder.\u201d\nPoirot stared at her.",
    "\u201cOh not a real one\u201d said Mrs Oliver reassuringly.",
    "\u201cTheres a big f\u043ate\nthing on tomorrow and as a kind of novelty theres going to be a Murder\nHunt.",
    "Arranged by me.",
    "Like a Treasure Hunt you see only theyve had a\nTreasure Hunt so often that they thought this would be a novelty.",
    "So they\noffered me a very substantial fee to come down and think it up.",
    "Quite fun\nreally  rather a change from the usual grim routine.\u201d\n\u201cHow does it work\u201d\n\u201cWell therell be a Victim of course.",
    "And Clues.",
    "And Suspects.",
    "All\nrather conventional  you know the Vamp and the Blackmailer and the\n\n\fYoung Lovers and the Sinister Butler and so on.",
    "Half a crown to enter and\nyou get shown the first Clue and youve got to find the Victim and the\nWeapon and say Whodunnit and the Motive.",
    "And there are Prizes.\u201d\n\u201cRemarkable\u201d said Hercule Poirot.",
    "\u201cActually\u201d said Mrs Oliver ruefully \u201cits all much harder to arrange\nthan youd think.",
    "Because youve got to allow for real people being quite\nintelligent and in my books they neednt be.\u201d\n\u201cAnd it is to assist you in arranging this that you have sent for me\u201d\nPoirot did not try very hard to keep an outraged resentment out of his\nvoice.",
    "\u201cOh no\u201d said Mrs Oliver.",
    "\u201cOf course not Ive done all that.",
    "Everythings all set for tomorrow.",
    "No I wanted you for quite another\nreason.\u201d\n\u201cWhat reason\u201d\nMrs Olivers hands strayed upward to her head.",
    "She was just about to\nsweep them frenziedly through her hair in the old familiar gesture when she\nremembered the intricacy of her hairdo.",
    "Instead she relieved her feelings\nby tugging at her ear lobes.",
    "\u201cI dare say Im a fool\u201d she said.",
    "\u201cBut I think theres something wrong.\u201d\n\n\fDead Mans Folly\n\n\f\fChapter 2\nThere was a moments silence as Poirot stared at her.",
    "Then he asked\nsharply \u201cSomething wrong How\u201d\n\u201cI dont know... Thats what I want you to find out.",
    "But Ive felt  more\nand more  that I was being  oh  engineered... jockeyed along...",
    "Call me a\nfool if you like but I can only say that if there was to be a real murder\ntomorrow instead of a fake one I shouldnt be surprised\u201d\nPoirot stared at her and she looked back at him defiantly.",
    "\u201cVery interesting\u201d said Poirot.",
    "\u201cI suppose you think Im a complete fool\u201d said Mrs Oliver defensively.",
    "\u201cI have never thought you a fool\u201d said Poirot.",
    "\u201cAnd I know what you always say  or look  about intuition.\u201d\n\u201cOne calls things by different names\u201d said Poirot.",
    "\u201cI am quite ready to\nbelieve that you have noticed something or heard something that has\ndefinitely aroused in you anxiety.",
    "I think it possible that you yourself may\nnot even know just what it is that you have seen or noticed or heard.",
    "You\nare aware only of the result.",
    "If I may so put it you do not know what it is\nthat you know.",
    "You may label that intuition if you like.\u201d\n\u201cIt makes one feel such a fool\u201d said Mrs Oliver ruefully \u201cnot to be\nable to be definite.\u201d\n\u201cWe shall arrive\u201d said Poirot encouragingly.",
    "\u201cYou say that you have\nhad the feeling of being  how did you put it  jockeyed along Can you\nexplain a little more clearly what you mean by that\u201d\n\u201cWell its rather difficult... You see this is my murder so to speak.",
    "Ive\nthought it out and planned it and it all fits in  dovetails.",
    "Well if you know\nanything at all about writers youll know that they cant stand suggestions.",
    "People say Splendid but wouldnt it be better if so and so did so and so or\nWouldnt it be a wonderful idea if the victim was A instead of B Or the\nmurderer turned out to be D instead of E I mean one wants to say All\nright then write it yourself if you want it that way\u201d\nPoirot nodded.",
    "\u201cAnd that is what has been happening\u201d\n\u201cNot quite... That sort of silly suggestion has been made and then Ive\nflared up and theyve given in but have just slipped in some quite minor\ntrivial suggestion and because Ive made a stand over the other Ive\naccepted the triviality without noticing much.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cI see\u201d said Poirot.",
    "\u201cYes  it is a method that... Something rather crude\nand preposterous is put forward  but that is not really the point.",
    "The small\nminor alteration is really the objective.",
    "Is that what you mean\u201d\n\u201cThats exactly what I mean\u201d said Mrs Oliver.",
    "\u201cAnd of course I may\nbe imagining it but I dont think I am  and none of the things seem to\nmatter anyway.",
    "But its got me worried  that and a sort of  well atmosphere.\u201d\n\u201cWho has made these suggestions of alterations to you\u201d\n\u201cDifferent people\u201d said Mrs Oliver.",
    "\u201cIf it was just one person Id be\nmore sure of my ground.",
    "But its not just one person  although I think it is\nreally.",
    "I mean its one person working through other quite unsuspecting\npeople.\u201d\n\u201cHave you an idea as to who that one person is\u201d\nMrs Oliver shook her head.",
    "\u201cIts somebody very clever and very careful\u201d she said.",
    "\u201cIt might be\nanybody.\u201d\n\u201cWho is there\u201d asked Poirot.",
    "\u201cThe cast of characters must be fairly\nlimited\u201d\n\u201cWell\u201d began Mrs Oliver.",
    "\u201cTheres Sir George Stubbs who owns this\nplace.",
    "Rich and plebeian and frightfully stupid outside business I should\nthink but probably dead sharp in it.",
    "And theres Lady Stubbs  Hattie about twenty years younger than he is rather beautiful but dumb as a fish in fact I think shes definitely halfwitted.",
    "Married him for his money of\ncourse and doesnt think about anything but clothes and jewels.",
    "Then\ntheres Michael Weyman  hes an architect quite young and goodlooking\nin a craggy kind of artistic way.",
    "Hes designing a tennis pavilion for Sir\nGeorge and repairing the Folly.\u201d\n\u201cFolly What is that  a masquerade\u201d\n\u201cNo its architectural.",
    "One of those little sort of temple things white\nwith columns.",
    "Youve probably seen them at Kew.",
    "Then theres Miss\nBrewis shes a sort of secretary housekeeper who runs things and writes\nletters  very grim and efficient.",
    "And then there are the people round about\nwho come in and help.",
    "A young married couple who have taken a cottage\ndown by the river  Alec Legge and his wife Sally.",
    "And Captain Warburton\nwhos the Mastertons agent.",
    "And the Mastertons of course and old Mrs\nFolliat who lives in what used to be the lodge.",
    "Her husbands people owned\n\n\fNasse originally.",
    "But theyve died out or been killed in wars and there\nwere lots of death duties so the last heir sold the place.\u201d\nPoirot considered this list of characters but at the moment they were\nonly names to him.",
    "He returned to the main issue.",
    "\u201cWhose idea was the Murder Hunt\u201d\n\u201cMrs Mastertons I think.",
    "Shes the local M.P.s wife very good at\norganising.",
    "It was she who persuaded Sir George to have the f\u043ate here.",
    "You\nsee the place has been empty for so many years that she thinks people will\nbe keen to pay and come in to see it.\u201d\n\u201cThat all seems straightforward enough\u201d said Poirot.",
    "\u201cIt all seems straightforward\u201d said Mrs Oliver obstinately \u201cbut it isnt.",
    "I\ntell you M. Poirot theres something wrong.\u201d\nPoirot looked at Mrs Oliver and Mrs Oliver looked back at Poirot.",
    "\u201cHow have you accounted for my presence here For your summons to\nme\u201d Poirot asked.",
    "\u201cThat was easy\u201d said Mrs Oliver.",
    "\u201cYoure to give away the prizes for\nthe Murder Hunt.",
    "Everybodys awfully thrilled.",
    "I said I knew you and could\nprobably persuade you to come and that I was sure your name would be a\nterrific draw  as of course it will be\u201d Mrs Oliver added tactfully.",
    "\u201cAnd the suggestion was accepted  without demur\u201d\n\u201cI tell you everybody was thrilled.\u201d\nMrs Oliver thought it unnecessary to mention that amongst the younger\ngeneration one or two had asked \u201cWho is Hercule Poirot\u201d\n\u201cEverybody Nobody spoke against it\u201d\nMrs Oliver shook her head.",
    "\u201cThat is a pity\u201d said Hercule Poirot.",
    "\u201cYou mean it might have given us a line\u201d\n\u201cA wouldbe criminal could hardly be expected to welcome my\npresence.\u201d\n\u201cI suppose you think Ive imagined the whole thing\u201d said Mrs Oliver\nruefully.",
    "\u201cI must admit that until I started talking to you I hadnt realised\nhow very little Ive got to go upon.\u201d\n\u201cCalm yourself\u201d said Poirot kindly.",
    "\u201cI am intrigued and interested.",
    "Where do we begin\u201d\nMrs Oliver glanced at her watch.",
    "\u201cIts just teatime.",
    "Well go back to the house and then you can meet\neverybody.\u201d\n\n\fShe took a different path from the one by which Poirot had come.",
    "This\none seemed to lead in the opposite direction.",
    "\u201cWe pass by the boathouse this way\u201d Mrs Oliver explained.",
    "As she spoke the boathouse came into view.",
    "It jutted out on to the river\nand was a picturesque thatched affair.",
    "\u201cThats where the Bodys going to be\u201d said Mrs Oliver.",

    "\u201cActually\u201d she said \u201cshes killed by the Country Squire  and the\nmotive is really rather ingenious  I dont believe many people will get it though theres a perfectly clear pointer in the fifth clue.\u201d\nPoirot abandoned the subtleties of Mrs Olivers plot to ask a practical\nquestion\n\u201cBut how do you arrange for a suitable body\u201d\n\u201cGirl Guide\u201d said Mrs Oliver.",

    "The nails were very long and varnished a deep puce.",
    "Into his mind a quotation came \u201cThey toil not neither do they spin...\u201d\nHe certainly couldnt imagine Lady Stubbs toiling or spinning.",
    "And yet\nhe would hardly have described her as a lily of the field.",
    "She was a far more\nartificial product.",
    "\u201cThis is a beautiful room you have here Madame\u201d he said looking\nround appreciatively.",
    "\u201cI suppose it is\u201d said Lady Stubbs vaguely.",

    "\u201cJust like a party  with lots and lots of people.\u201d\n\u201cWill it be like Ascot With big hats and everyone very chic\u201d\n\u201cWell not quite like Ascot\u201d said Mrs Folliat.",

    "Come now\u201d\n\n\f\u201cOh very well.\u201d Mrs Folliat gave a halflaugh and rose.",
    "As she went out of the room her small figure following Hatties tall one\nPoirot saw her face and was quite startled at the weariness on it which had\nreplaced her smiling composure.",
    "It was as though relaxed and off her guard\nfor a moment she no longer bothered to keep up the social mask.",
    "And yet it seemed more than that.",
    "Perhaps she was suffering from some disease\nabout which like many women do she never spoke.",
    "She was not a person\nhe thought who would care to invite pity or sympathy.",
    "Captain Warburton dropped down in the chair Hattie Stubbs had just\nvacated.",
    "He too looked at the door through which the two women had just\npassed but it was not of the older woman that he spoke.",
    "Instead he drawled\nwith a slight grin\n\u201cBeautiful creature isnt she\u201d He observed with the tail of his eye Sir\nGeorges exit through a french window with Mrs Masterton and Mrs Oliver\nin tow.",

    "And the girls giggle.",

    "\u201cCome now George dont get started on communists\u201d said Mrs Legge.",
    "\u201cIll come and help you deal with the rabid women.\u201d\n\n\fShe led him out of the window and called over her shoulder \u201cCome on\nJim.",
    "Come and be torn to pieces in a good cause.\u201d\n\u201cAll right but I want to put M. Poirot in the picture about the Murder\nHunt since hes going to present the prizes.\u201d\n\u201cYou can do that presently.\u201d\n\u201cI will await you here\u201d said Poirot agreeably.",
    "In the ensuing silence Alec Legge Stretched himself out in his chair and\nsighed.",
    "\u201cWomen\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cLike a swarm of bees.\u201d\nHe turned his head to look out of he window.",
    "\u201cAnd whats it all about Some silly garden f\u043ate that doesnt matter to\nanyone.\u201d\n\u201cBut obviously\u201d Poirot pointed out \u201cthere are those to whom it does\nmatter.\u201d\n\u201cWhy cant people have some sense Why cant they think Think of the\nmess the whole world has got itself into.",
    "Dont they realise that the\ninhabitants of the globe are busy committing suicide\u201d\nPoirot judged rightly that he was not intended to reply to this question.",
    "He merely shook his head doubtfully.",
    "\u201cUnless we can do something before its too late...\u201d Alec Legge broke\noff.",
    "An angry look swept over his face.",
    "\u201cOh yes\u201d he said \u201cI know what\nyoure thinking.",
    "That Im nervy neurotic  all the rest of it.",
    "Like those\ndamned doctors.",
    "Advising rest and change and sea air.",
    "All right.",
    "Sally and I\ncame down here and took the Mill Cottage for three months and Ive\nfollowed their prescription.",
    "Ive fished and bathed and taken long walks and\nsunbathed \u201d\nI noticed that you had sunbathed yes said Poirot politely.",
    "\u201cOh this\u201d Alecs hand went to his sore face.",
    "\u201cThats the result of a fine\nEnglish summer for once in a way.",
    "But whats the good of it all You cant\nget away from facing truth just by running away from it.\u201d\n\u201cNo it is never any good running away.\u201d\n\u201cAnd being in a rural atmosphere like this just makes you realise things\nmore keenly  that and the incredible apathy of the people of this country.",
    "Even Sally whos intelligent enough is just the same.",
    "Why bother Thats\nwhat she says.",
    "It makes me mad Why bother\u201d\n\u201cAs a matter of interest why do you\u201d\n\u201cGood God you too\u201d\n\n\f\u201cNo it is not advice.",
    "It is just that I would like to know your answer.\u201d\n\u201cDont you see somebodys got to do something\u201d\n\u201cAnd that somebody is you\u201d\n\u201cNo no not me personally.",
    "One cant be personal in times like these.\u201d\n\u201cI do not see why not.",
    "Even in these times as you call it one is still a\nperson.\u201d\n\u201cBut one shouldnt be In times of stress when its a matter of life or\ndeath one cant think of ones own insignificant ills or preoccupations.\u201d\n\u201cI assure you you are quite wrong.",
    "In the late war during a severe airraid I was much less preoccupied by the thought of death than of the pain\nfrom a corn on my little toe.",
    "It surprised me at the time that it should be so.",
    "Think I said to myself at any moment now death may come.",
    "But I was\nstill conscious of my corn  indeed I felt injured that I should have that to\nsuffer as well as the fear of death.",
    "It was because I might die that every\nsmall personal matter in my life acquired increased importance.",
    "I have seen\na woman knocked down in a street accident with a broken leg and she has\nburst out crying because she sees that there is a ladder in her stocking.\u201d\n\u201cWhich just shows you what fools women are\u201d\n\u201cIt shows you what people are.",
    "It is perhaps that absorption in ones\npersonal life that has led the human race to survive.\u201d\nAlec Legge gave a scornful laugh.",
    "\u201cSometimes\u201d he said \u201cI think its a pity they ever did.\u201d\n\u201cIt is you know\u201d Poirot persisted \u201ca form of humility.",
    "And humility is\nvaluable.",
    "There was a slogan that was written up in your underground\nrailways here I remember during the war.",
    "It all depends on you.",
    "It was\ncomposed I think by some eminent divine  but in my opinion it was a\ndangerous and undesirable doctrine.",
    "For it is not true.",
    "Everything does not\ndepend on say Mrs Blank of LittleBlankintheMarsh.",
    "And if she is led to\nthink it does it will not be good for her character.",
    "While she thinks of the\npart she can play in world affairs the baby pulls over the kettle.\u201d\n\u201cYou are rather oldfashioned in your views I think.",
    "Lets hear what\nyour slogan would be.\u201d\n\u201cI do not need to formulate one of my own.",
    "There is an older one in this\ncountry which contents me very well.\u201d\n\u201cWhat is that\u201d\n\u201cPut your trust in God and keep your powder dry.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cWell well...\u201d Alec Legge seemed amused.",
    "\u201cMost unexpected coming\nfrom you.",
    "Do you know what I should like to see done in this country\u201d\n\u201cSomething no doubt forceful and unpleasant\u201d said Poirot smiling.",
    "Alec Legge remained serious.",
    "\u201cI should like to see every feebleminded person put out  right out\nDont let them breed.",
    "If for one generation only the intelligent were\nallowed to breed think what the result would be.\u201d\nA very large increase of patients in the psychiatric wards perhaps\u201c said\nPoirot dryly.",
    "\u201dOne needs roots as well as flowers on a plant M. Legge.",
    "However large and beautiful the flowers if the earthy roots are destroyed\nthere will be no more flowers.\u201c He added in a conversational tone \u201dWould\nyou consider Lady Stubbs a candidate for the lethal chamber\n\u201cYes indeed.",
    "Whats the good of a woman like that What contribution\nhas she ever made to society Has she ever had an idea in her head that\nwasnt of clothes or furs or jewels As I say what good is she\u201d\n\u201cYou and I\u201d said Poirot blandly \u201care certainly much more intelligent\nthan Lady Stubbs.",
    "But \u201d he shook his head sadly  \u201cit is true I fear that we\nare not nearly so ornamental.\u201d\n\u201cOrnamental...\u201d Alec was beginning with a fierce snort but he was\ninterrupted by the reentry of Mrs Oliver and Captain Warburton through\nthe window.",
    "Dead Mans Folly\n\n\f\fChapter 4\n\u201cYou must come and see the clues and things for the Murder Hunt M.\nPoirot\u201d said Mrs Oliver breathlessly.",
    "Poirot rose and followed them obediently.",
    "The three of them went across the hall and into a small room furnished\nplainly as a business office.",
    "\u201cLethal weapons to your left\u201d observed Captain Warburton waving his\nhand towards a small baizecovered card table.",
    "On it were laid out a small\npistol a piece of lead piping with a rusty sinister stain on it a blue bottle\nlabelled Poison a length of clothes line and a hypodermic syringe.",
    "\u201cThose are the Weapons\u201d explained Mrs Oliver \u201cand these are the\nSuspects.\u201d\nShe handed him a printed card which he read with interest.",
    "SUSPECTS\nEstelle Glynne  a beautiful and mysterious young woman the guest of\nColonel Blunt  the local Squire whose daughter\nJoan  is married to\nPeter Gaye  a young Atom Scientist.",
    "Miss Willing  a housekeeper.",
    "Quiett  a butler.",
    "Maya Stavisky  a girl hiker.",
    "Esteban Loyola  an uninvited guest.",
    "Poirot blinked and looked towards Mrs Oliver in mute\nincomprehension.",
    "\u201cA magnificent Cast of Characters\u201d he said politely.",
    "\u201cBut permit me to\nask Madame what does the Competitor do\u201d\n\u201cTurn the card over\u201d said Captain Warburton.",
    "Poirot did so.",
    "On the other side was printed\nName and address \nSolution\nName of Murderer \nWeapon \nMotive \nTime and Place \nReasons for arriving at your conclusions \n\n\f\u201cEveryone who enters gets one of these\u201d explained Captain Warburton\nrapidly.",
    "\u201cAlso a notebook and pencil for copying clues.",
    "There will be six\nclues.",
    "You go on from one to the other like a Treasure Hunt and the\nweapons are concealed in suspicious places.",
    "Heres the first clue.",
    "A\nsnapshot.",
    "Everyone starts with one of these.\u201d\nPoirot took the small print from him and studied it with a frown.",
    "Then\nhe turned it upside down.",
    "He still looked puzzled.",
    "Warburton laughed.",
    "\u201cIngenious bit of trick photography isnt it\u201d he said complacently.",
    "\u201cQuite simple once you know what it is.\u201d\nPoirot who did not know what it was felt a mounting annoyance.",
    "\u201cSome kind of barred window\u201d he suggested.",
    "\u201cLooks a bit like it I admit.",
    "No its a section of a tennis net.\u201d\n\u201cAh.\u201d Poirot looked again at the snapshot.",
    "\u201cYes it is as you say  quite\nobvious when you have been told what it is\u201d\n\u201cSo much depends on how you look at a thing\u201d laughed Warburton.",
    "\u201cThat is a very profound truth.\u201d\n\u201cThe second clue will be found in a box under the centre of the tennis\nnet.",
    "In the box are this empty poison bottle  here and a loose cork.\u201d\n\u201cOnly you see\u201d said Mrs Oliver rapidly \u201cits a screwtopped bottle so\nthe cork is really the clue.\u201d\n\u201cI know Madame that you are always full of ingenuity but I do not\nquite see \u201d\nMrs Oliver interrupted him.",
    "\u201cOh but of course\u201d she said \u201ctheres a story.",
    "Like in a magazine serial\n a synopsis.\u201d She turned to Captain Warburton.",
    "\u201cHave you got the\nleaflets\u201d\n\u201cTheyve not come from the printers yet.\u201d\n\u201cBut they promised\u201d\n\u201cI know.",
    "I know.",
    "Everyone always promises.",
    "Theyll be ready this\nevening at six.",
    "Im going to fetch them in the car.\u201d\n\u201cOh good.\u201d\nMrs Oliver gave a deep sigh nd turned to Poirot.",
    "\u201cWell Ill have to tell it you then.",
    "Only Im not very good at telling\nthings.",
    "I mean if I write things I get them perfectly clear but if I talk it\nalways sounds the most frightful muddle and thats why I never discuss my\nplots with anyone.",
    "Ive learnt not to because if I do they just look at me\nblankly and say  er  yes but  I dont see what happened  and surely that\n\n\fcant possibly make a book.",
    "So damping.",
    "And not true because when I\nwrite it it does\u201d\nMrs Oliver paused for breath and then went on\n\u201cWell its like this.",
    "Theres Peter Gaye whos a young Atom Scientist\nand hes suspect of being in the pay of the Communists and hes married to\nthis girl Joan Blunt and his first wifes dead but she isnt and she turns up\nbecause shes a secret agent or perhaps not I mean she may really be a\nhiker  and the wifes having an affair and this man Loyola turns up either\nto meet Maya or to spy upon her and theres a blackmailing letter which\nmight be from the housekeeper or again it might be the butler and the\nrevolvers missing and as you dont know who the blackmailing letters to\nand the hypodermic syringe fell out at dinner and after that it\ndisappeared...\u201d\nMrs Oliver came to a full stop estimating correctly Poirots reaction.",
    "\u201cI know\u201d she said sympathetically.",
    "It sounds just a muddle but it isnt\nreally  not in my head  and when you see the synopsis leaflet youll find\nits quite clear.",
    "\u201cAnd anyway\u201d she ended \u201cthe story doesnt really matter does it I\nmean not to you.",
    "All youve got to do is to present the prizes  very nice\nprizes the firsts a silver cigarette case shaped like a revolver  and say how\nremarkably clever the solver has been.\u201d\nPoirot thought to himself that the solver would indeed have been clever.",
    "In fact he doubted very much that there would be a solver.",
    "The whole plot\nand action of the Murder Hunt seemed to him to be wrapped in\nimpenetrable fog.",
    "\u201cWell\u201d said Captain Warburton cheerfully glancing at his wristwatch.",
    "\u201cId better be off to the printers and collect.\u201d\nMrs Oliver groaned.",
    "\u201cIf theyre not done \u201d\n\u201cOh theyre done all right.",
    "I telephoned.",
    "So long.\u201d\nHe left the room.",
    "Mrs Oliver immediately clutched Poirot by the arm and demanded in a\nhoarse whisper\n\u201cWell\u201d\n\u201cWell  what\u201d\n\u201cHave you found out anything Or spotted anybody\u201d\nPoirot replied with mild reproof in his tones\n\n\f\u201cEverybody and everything seems to me completely normal.\u201d\n\u201cNormal\u201d\n\u201cWell perhaps that is not quite the right word.",
    "Lady Stubbs as you say\nis definitely subnormal and Mr Legge would appear to be rather\nabnormal.\u201d\n\u201cOh hes all right\u201d said Mrs Oliver impatiently.",
    "\u201cHes had a nervous\nbreakdown.\u201d\nPoirot did not question the somewhat doubtful wording of this sentence\nbut accepted it at its face value.",
    "\u201cEverybody appears to be in the expected state of nervous agitation\nhigh excitement general fatigue and strong irritation which are\ncharacteristic of preparation for this form of entertainment.",
    "If you could\nonly indicate \u201d\n\u201cSh\u201d Mrs Oliver grasped his arm again.",
    "\u201cSomeones coming.\u201d\nIt was just like a bad melodrama Poirot felt his own irritation\nmounting.",
    "The pleasant mild face of Miss Brewis appeared round the door.",
    "\u201cOh there you are M. Poirot.",
    "Ive been looking for you to show you\nyour room.\u201d\nShe led him up the staircase and along a passage to a big airy room\nlooking out over the river.",
    "\u201cThere is a bathroom just opposite.",
    "Sir George talks of adding more\nbathrooms but to do so would sadly impair the proportions of the rooms.",
    "I\nhope youll find everything quite comfortable.\u201d\n\u201cYes indeed.\u201d Poirot swept an appreciative eye over the small\nbookstand the readinglamp and the box labelled \u201cBiscuits\u201d by the bedside.",
    "\u201cYou seem in this house to have everything organised to perfection.",
    "Am I\nto congratulate you or my charming hostess\u201d\n\u201cLady Stubbs time is fully taken up in being charming\u201d said Miss\nBrewis a slightly acid note in her voice.",
    "\u201cA very decorative young woman\u201d mused Poirot.",
    "\u201cAs you say.\u201d\n\u201cBut in other respects is she not perhaps...\u201d He broke off.",
    "\u201cPardon.",
    "I am\nindiscreet.",
    "I comment on something I ought not perhaps to mention.\u201d\nMiss Brewis gave him a steady look.",
    "She said dryly\n\u201cLady Stubbs knows perfectly well exactly what she is doing.",
    "Besides\nbeing as you said a very decorative young woman she is also a very\n\n\fshrewd one.\u201d\nShe had turned away and left the room before Poirots eyebrows had\nfully risen in surprise.",
    "So that was what the efficient Miss Brewis thought\nwas it Or had she merely said so for some reason of her own And why\nhad she made such a statement to him  to a newcomer Because he was a\nnewcomer perhaps And also because he was a foreigner.",
    "As Hercule\nPoirot had discovered by experience there were many English people who\nconsidered that what one said to foreigners didnt count\nHe frowned perplexedly staring absentmindedly at the door out of\nwhich Miss Brewis had gone.",
    "Then he strolled over to the window and\nstood looking out.",
    "As he did so he saw Lady Stubbs come out of the house\nwith Mrs Folliat and they stood for a moment or two talking by the big\nmagnolia tree.",
    "Then Mrs Folliat nodded a goodbye picked up her\ngardening basket and glove and trotted off down the drive.",
    "Lady Stubbs\nstood watching her for a moment then absentmindedly pulled off a\nmagnolia flower smelt it and began slowly to walk down the path that led\nthough the trees to the river.",
    "St looked just once over her shoulder before\nshe disappeared from sight.",
    "From behind the magnolia tree Michael\nWeyman came quietly into view paused a moment irresolutely and then\nfollowed the tall slim figure down into the trees.",
    "A goodlooking and dynamic young man Poirot thought with a more\nattractive personality no doubt than that of Sir George Stubbs...",
    "But if so what of it Such patterns formed themselves eternally through\nlife.",
    "Rich middleaged unattractive husband young and beautiful wife with\nor without sufficient mental development attractive and susceptible young\nman.",
    "What was there in that to make Mrs Oliver utter a peremptory\nsummons through the telephone Mrs Oliver no doubt had a vivid\nimagination but...\n\u201cBut after all\u201d murmured Hercule Poirot to himself \u201cI am not a\nconsultant in adultery  or in incipient adultery \u201d\nCould there really be anything in this extraordinary notion of Mrs\nOlivers that something was wrong Mrs Oliver was a singularly muddleheaded woman and how she managed somehow or other to turn out\ncoherent detective stories was beyond him and yet for all her muddleheadedness she often surprised him by her sudden perception of truth.",
    "\u201cThe time is short  short\u201d he murmured to himself \u201cIs there something\nwrong here as Mrs Oliver believes I am inclined to think there is.",
    "But\n\n\fwhat Who is there who could enlighten me I need to know more much\nmore about the people in this house.",
    "Who is there who could inform me\u201d\nAfter a moments reflection he seized his hat Poirot never risked going\nout in the evening air with uncovered head and hurried out of his room\nand down the stairs.",
    "He heard afar the dictatorial baying of Mrs Mastertons\ndeep voice.",
    "Nearer at hand Sir Georges voice rose with an amorous\nintonation.",
    "\u201cDamned becoming that yasmak thing.",
    "Wish I had you in my harem\nSally.",
    "I shall come and have my fortune told a good deal tomorrow.",
    "Whatll\nyou tell me eh\u201d\nThere was a slight scuffle and Sally Legges voice said breathlessly\n\u201cGeorge you mustnt.\u201d\nPoirot raised his eyebrows and slipped out of a conveniently adjacent\nside door.",
    "He set off at top speed down a back drive which his sense of\nlocality enabled him to predict would at some point join the front drive.",
    "His manoeuvre was successful and enabled him  panting very slightly to come up beside Mrs Folliat and relieve her in a gallant manner of her\ngardening basket.",
    "\u201cYou permit Madame\u201d\n\u201cOh thank you M. Poirot thats very kind of you.",
    "But its not heavy.\u201d\n\u201cAllow me to carry it for you to your home.",
    "You live near here\u201d\n\u201cI actually live in the lodge by the front gate.",
    "Sir George very kindly\nrents it to me.\u201d\nThe lodge by the front gate of her former home... How did she really\nfeel about that Poirot pondered.",
    "Her composure was so absolute that he had\nno clue to her feelings.",
    "He changed the subject by observing\n\u201cLady Stubbs is much younger than her husband is she not\u201d\n\u201cTwentythree years younger.\u201d\n\u201cPhysically she is very attractive.\u201d\nMrs Folliat said quietly\n\u201cHattie is a dear good child.\u201d\nIt was not an answer he had expected.",
    "Mrs Folliat went on\n\u201cI know her very well you see.",
    "For a short time she was under my\ncare.\u201d\n\u201cI did not know that.\u201d\n\u201cHow should you It is in a way a sad story.",
    "Her people had estates\nsugar estates in the West Indies.",
    "As a result of an earthquake the house\n\n\fthere was burned down and her parents and brothers and sisters all lost their\nlives.",
    "Hattie herself was at a convent in Paris and was thus suddenly left\nwithout any near relatives.",
    "It was considered advisable by the executors that\nHattie should be chaperoned and introduced into society after she had spent\na certain time abroad.",
    "I accepted charge of her.\u201d Mrs Folliat added wit a dry\nsmile \u201cI can smarten myself up on occasions and naturally I had the\nnecessary connections  in fact the late Governor had been a close friend of\nours.\u201d\n\u201cNaturally Madame I understand all that.\u201d\n\u201cIt suited me very well  I was going through a difficult time.",
    "My\nhusband had died just before the outbreak of war.",
    "My elder son who was in\nthe navy went down with his ship my younger son who had been out in\nKenya came back joined the commandos and was killed in Italy.",
    "That\nmeant lots of death duties and this house had to be put up for sale.",
    "I myself\nwas very badly off and I as glad of the distraction of having someone young\nto after and travel about with.",
    "I became very fond of Hattie all the more\nperhaps because I soon realised that she was  shall we say  not fully\ncapable of fending for herself Understand me M. Poirot Hattie is not\nmentally deficient but she is what country folk describe as simple.",
    "She is\neasily imposed upon over docely completely open to suggestion.",
    "I think\nmyself that it was a blessing there was practically no money.",
    "If she had\nbeen an heiress her position might have been one of much greater difficulty.",
    "She was attractive to men and being of an affectionate nature was easily\nattracted and influenced  she had definitely to be looked after.",
    "When after\nthe final winding up of her parents estate it was discovered that the\nplantation was destroyed and there were more debts than assets I could\nonly be thankful that a man such as Sir George Stubbs had fallen in love\nwith her and wanted to marry her.\u201d\n\u201cPossibly  yes  it was a solution.\u201d\n\u201cSir George\u201d said Mrs Folliat \u201cthough he is a selfmade man and  let\nus face it  a complete vulgarian is kindly and fundamentally decent\nbesides being extremely wealthy.",
    "I dont think he would ever ask for mental\ncompanionship from a wife which is just as well.",
    "Hattie is everything he\nwants.",
    "She displays clothes and jewels to perfection is affectionate and\nwilling and is completely happy with him.",
    "I confess that I am very thankful\nthat that is so for I admit that I deliberately influenced her to accept him.",
    "If\nit had turned out badly \u201d her voice faltered a little  \u201cit would have been my\n\n\ffault for urging her to marry a man so many years older than herself.",
    "You\nsee as I told you Hattie is completely suggestible.",
    "Anyone she is with at\nthe time can dominate her.\u201d\n\u201cIt seems to me\u201d said Poirot approvingly \u201cthat you made there a most\nprudent arrangement for her.",
    "I am not like the English romantic.",
    "To\narrange a good marriage one must take more than romance into\nconsideration.\u201d\nHe added\n\u201cAnd as for this place here Nasse House it is a most beautiful spot.",
    "Quite as the saying goes out of this world.\u201d\n\u201cSince Nasse had to be sold\u201d said Mrs Folliat with a faint tremor in her\nvoice \u201cI am glad that Sir George bought it.",
    "It was requisitioned during the\nwar by the Army and afterwards it might have been bought and made into a\nguest house or a school the rooms cut up and partitioned distorted out of\ntheir natural beauty.",
    "Our neighbours the Fletchers at Hoodown had to sell\ntheir place and it is now a Youth Hostel.",
    "One is glad that young people\nshould enjoy themselves  and fortunately Hoodown is lateVictorian and\nof no great architectural merit so that the alterations do not matter.",
    "Im\nafraid some of the young people trespass on our grounds.",
    "It makes Sir\nGeorge very angry.",
    "Its true that they have occasionally damaged the rare\nshrubs by hacking them about  they come through here trying to get a short\ncut to the ferry across the river.\u201d\nThey were standing now by the front gate.",

    "\u201cAnd your friend\u201d\n\u201cOh yes she too comes here this afternoon.",
    "I have not seen her yet\nbut we shall leave together by the bus that goes from the gates at fivefifteen.",
    "We go to Torquay and there I change to another bus for Plymouth.",
    "It\nis convenient.\u201d\nThis explained what had puzzled Poirot the fact that the Dutch girl was\nperspiring under the weight of a rucksack.",
    "He said \u201cI saw your friend this morning.\u201d\n\u201cOh yes Elsa a German girl was with her and she told me they had\ntried to get through woods to the river and quay.",
    "And the gentleman who\nowns the house was very angry and made them go back.\u201d\nShe added turning her head to where Sir George was urging\ncompetitors at the coconut shy\n\u201cBut now  this afternoon he is very polite.\u201d\nPoirot considered explaining that there was a difference between young\nwomen who were trespassers and the same young women when they had\n\n\fpaid two shillings and sixpence entrance fee and were legally entitled to\nsample the delights of Nasse House and its grounds.",
    "But Captain Warburton\nand his megaphone bore down upon him.",
    "The Captain was looking hot and\nbothered.",
    "\u201cHave you seen Lady Stubbs Poirot Anyone seen Lady Stubbs Shes\nsupposed to be judging this Fancy Dress business and I cant find her\nanywhere.\u201d\n\u201cI saw her let me see  oh about half an hour ago.",
    "But then I went to\nhave my fortune told.\u201d\n\u201cCurse the woman\u201d said Warburton angrily.",
    "\u201cWhere can she have\ndisappeared to The children are waiting and were behind schedule as it\nis.\u201d\nHe looked round.",
    "\u201cWheres Amanda Brewis\u201d\nMiss Brewis also was not in evidence.",
    "\u201cIt really is too bad\u201d said Warburton.",
    "\u201cOnes got to have some cooperation if ones trying to run a show.",
    "Where can Hattie be Perhaps shes\ngone into the house.\u201d\nHe strode off rapidly.",
    "Poirot edged his way towards the ropedoff space where teas were being\nserved in a large marquee but there was a long waiting queue and he\ndecided against it.",
    "He inspected the Fancy Goods stall where a determined old lady very\nnearly managed to sell him a plastic collar box and finally made his way\nround the outskirts to a place where he could contemplate the activity from\na safe distance.",
    "He wondered where Mrs Oliver was.",
    "Footsteps behind him made him turn his head.",
    "A young man was\ncoming up the path from the quay a very dark young man faultlessly\nattired in yachting costume.",
    "He paused as though disconcerted by the scene\nbefore him.",
    "Then he spoke hesitatingly to Poirot.",
    "\u201cYou will excuse me.",
    "Is this the house of Sir Georges Stubbs\u201d\n\u201cIt is indeed.\u201d Poirot paused and then hazarded a guess.",
    "\u201cAre you\nperhaps the cousin of Lady Stubbs\u201d\n\u201cI am Etienne de Sousa \u201d\n\u201cMy name is Hercule Poirot.\u201d\n\n\fThey bowed to each other.",
    "Poirot explained the circumstances of the\nf\u043ate.",
    "As he finished Sir George came across the lawn towards them from\nthe coconut shy.",
    "\u201cDe Sousa Delighted to see you.",
    "Hattie got your letter this morning.",
    "Wheres your yacht\u201d\n\u201cIt is moored at Helmmouth.",
    "I came up the river to the quay here in my\nlaunch.\u201d\n\u201cWe must find Hattie.",
    "Shes somewhere about... Youll dine with us this\nevening I hope\u201d\n\u201cYou are most kind.\u201d\n\u201cCan we put you up\u201d\n\u201cThat also is most kind but I will sleep on my yacht.",
    "It is easier so.\u201d\n\u201cAre you staying here long\u201d\n\u201cTwo or three days perhaps.",
    "It depends.\u201d De Sousa shrugged elegant\nshoulders.",
    "\u201cHattie will be delighted Im sure\u201d said Sir George politely.",
    "\u201cWhere is\nshe I saw her not long ago.\u201d\nHe looked round in a perplexed manner.",
    "\u201cShe ought to be judging the childrens fancy dress.",
    "I cant understand it.",
    "Excuse me a moment.",
    "Ill ask Miss Brewis.\u201d\nHe hurried off.",
    "De Sousa looked after him.",
    "Poirot looked at De Sousa.",
    "\u201cIt is some little time since you last saw your cousin\u201d he asked.",
    "The other shrugged his shoulders.",
    "\u201cI have not seen her since she was fifteen years old.",
    "Soon after that she\nwas sent abroad  to school at a convent in France.",
    "As a child she promised\nto have good looks.\u201d\nHe looked inquiringly at Poirot.",
    "\u201cShe is a beautiful woman\u201d said Poirot.",
    "\u201cAnd that is her husband He seems what they call a good fellow but\nnot perhaps very polished Still for Hattie it might be perhaps a little\ndifficult to find a suitable husband.\u201d\nPoirot remained with a politely inquiring expression on his face.",
    "The\nother laughed.",
    "\u201cOh it is no secret.",
    "At fifteen Hattie was mentally undeveloped.",
    "Feeble\nminded do you not call it She is still the same\u201d\n\u201cIt would seem so  yes\u201d said Poirot cautiously.",
    "De Sousa shrugged his shoulders.",
    "\u201cAh well Why should one ask it of women  that they should be\nintelligent It is not necessary.\u201d\nSir George was back fuming.",
    "Miss Brewis was with him speaking\nrather breathlessly.",
    "\u201cIve no idea where she is Sir George.",
    "I saw her over by the fortune\ntellers tent last.",
    "But that was at least twenty minutes or half an hour ago.",
    "Shes not in the house.\u201d\n\u201cIs it not possible\u201d asked Poirot \u201cthat she has gone to observe the\nprogress of Mrs Olivers murder hunt\u201d\nSir Georges brow cleared.",
    "\u201cThats probably it.",
    "Look here I cant leave the shows here.",
    "Im in\ncharge.",
    "And Amandas got her hands full.",
    "Could you possibly have a look\nround Poirot You know the course.\u201d\nBut Poirot did not know the course.",
    "However an inquiry of Miss\nBrewis gave him rough guidance.",
    "Miss Brewis took brisk charge of De\nSousa and Poirot went off murmuring to himself like an incantation\n\u201cTennis Court Camellia Garden The Folly Upper Nursery Garden\nBoathouse...\u201d\nAs he passed the coconut shy he was amused to notice Sir George\nproffering wooden balls with a dazzling smile of welcome to the same\nyoung Italian woman whom he had driven off that morning and who was\nclearly puzzled at his change of attitude.",
    "He went on his way to the tennis court.",
    "But there was no one there but\nan old gentleman of military aspect who was fast asleep on a garden seat\nwith his hat pulled over his eyes.",
    "Poirot retraced his steps to the house and\nwent on down to the camellia garden.",
    "In the camellia garden Poirot found Mrs Oliver dressed in purple\nsplendour sitting on a garden seat in a brooding attitude and looking rather\nlike Mrs Siddons.",
    "She beckoned him to the seat beside her.",
    "\u201cThis is only the second clue\u201d she hissed.",
    "\u201cI think Ive made them too\ndifficult.",
    "Nobodys come yet.\u201d\nAt this moment a young man in shorts with a prominent Adams apple\nentered the garden.",
    "With a cry of satisfaction he hurried to a tree in one\ncorner and a further satisfied cry announced his discovery of the next clue.",
    "Passing them he felt impelled to communicate his satisfaction.",
    "\u201cLots of people dont know about cork trees\u201d he said confidentially.",
    "\u201cClever photograph the first clue but I spotted what it was  section of a\n\n\ftennis net.",
    "There was a poison bottle empty and a cork.",
    "Most of em will\ngo all out after the bottle clue  I guessed it was a red herring.",
    "Very delicate\ncork trees only hardy in this part of the world.",
    "Im interested in rare shrubs\nand trees.",
    "Now where does one go I wonder\u201d\nHe frowned over the entry in the notebook he carried.",
    "\u201cIve copied the next clue but it doesnt seem to make sense.\u201d He eyed\nthem suspiciously.",
    "\u201cYou competing\u201d\n\u201cOh no\u201d said Mrs Oliver.",
    "\u201cWere just  looking on.\u201d\n\u201cRightyho...",
    "When lovely woman stoops to folly.... Ive an idea Ive\nheard that somewhere.\u201d\n\u201cIt is a wellknown quotation\u201d said Poirot.",
    "\u201cA Folly can also be a building\u201d said Mrs Oliver helpfully.",
    "\u201cWhite with pillars\u201d she added.",
    "\u201cThats an idea Thanks a lot.",
    "They say Mrs Ariadne Oliver is down\nhere herself somewhere about.",
    "Id like to get her autograph.",
    "You havent\nseen her about have you\u201d\n\u201cNo\u201d said Mrs Oliver firmly.",
    "\u201cId like to meet her.",
    "Good yarns she writes.\u201d He lowered his voice.",
    "\u201cBut they say she drinks like a fish.\u201d\nHe hurried off and Mrs Oliver said indignantly\n\u201cReally Thats most unfair when I only like lemonade\u201d\n\u201cAnd have you not just perpetrated the great unfairness in helping that\nyoung man towards the next clue\u201d\n\u201cConsidering hes the only one whos got here so far I thought he ought\nto be encouraged.\u201d\n\u201cBut you wouldnt give him your autograph.\u201d\n\u201cThats different\u201d said Mrs Oliver.",
    "\u201cSh Here come some more.\u201d\nBut these were not clue hunters.",
    "They were two women who having\npaid for admittance were determined to get their moneys worth by seeing\nthe grounds thoroughly.",
    "They were hot and dissatisfied.",
    "\u201cYoud think theyd have some nice flowerbeds\u201d said one to the other.",
    "\u201cNothing but trees and more trees.",
    "Its not what I call a garden.\u201d\nMrs Oliver nudged Poirot and they slipped quietly away.",
    "\u201cSupposing\u201d said Mrs Oliver distractedly \u201cthat nobody ever finds my\nbody\u201d\n\n\f\u201cPatience Madame and courage\u201d said Poirot.",
    "\u201cThe afternoon is still\nyoung.\u201d\n\u201cThats true\u201d said Mrs Oliver brightening.",
    "\u201cAnd its halfprice\nadmission after fourthirty so probably lots of people will flock in.",
    "Lets go\nand see how that Marlene child is getting on.",
    "I dont really trust that girl\nyou know.",
    "No sense of responsibility.",
    "I wouldnt put it past her to sneak\naway quietly instead of being a corpse and go and have tea.",
    "You know\nwhat people are like about their teas.\u201d\nThey proceeded amicably along the woodland path and Poirot\ncommented on the geography of the property.",
    "\u201cI find it very confusing\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cSo many paths and one is never\nsure where they lead.",
    "And trees trees everywhere.\u201d\n\u201cYou sound like that disgruntled woman weve just left.\u201d\nThey passed the Folly and zigzagged down the path to the river.",
    "The\noutlines of the boathouse showed beneath them.",
    "Poirot remarked that it would be awkward if the murder searchers were\nto light upon the boathouse and find the body by accident.",
    "\u201cA sort of short cut I thought of that.",
    "Thats why the last clue is just a\nkey.",
    "You cant unlock the door without it.",
    "Its a Yale.",
    "You can only open it\nfrom the inside.\u201d\nA short steep slope led down to the door of the boathouse which was\nbuilt out over the river with a little wharf and a storage place for boats\nunderneath.",
    "Mrs Oliver took a key from a pocket concealed amongst her\npurple folds and unlocked the door.",
    "\u201cWeve just come to cheer you up Marlene\u201d she said brightly as she\nentered.",
    "She felt slightly remorseful at her unjust suspicions of Marlenes loyalty\nfor Marlene artistically arranged as \u201cthe body\u201d was playing her part nobly\nsprawled on the floor by the window.",
    "Marlene made no response.",
    "She lay quite motionless.",
    "The wind blowing\ngently through the open window rustled a pile of \u201ccomics\u201d spread out on\nthe table.",
    "\u201cIts all right\u201d said Mrs Oliver impatiently.",
    "\u201cIts only me and M. Poirot.",
    "Nobodys got any distance with the clues yet.\u201d\nPoirot was frowning.",
    "Very gently he pushed Mrs Oliver aside and went\nand bent over the girl on the floor.",
    "A suppressed exclamation came from his\nlips.",
    "He looked up at Mrs Oliver.",
    "\u201cSo...\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cThat which you expected has happened.\u201d\n\u201cYou dont mean...\u201d Mrs Olivers eyes widened in horror.",
    "She grasped\nfor one of the basket chairs and sat down.",
    "\u201cYou cant mean... She isnt\ndead\u201d\nPoirot nodded.",
    "\u201cOh yes\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cShe is dead.",
    "Though not very long dead.\u201d\n\u201cBut how \u201d\nHe lifted the corner of the gay scarf bound round the girls head so that\nMrs Oliver could see the ends of the clothes line.",
    "\u201cJust like my murder\u201d said Mrs Oliver unsteadily.",
    "\u201cBut who And\nwhy\u201d\n\u201cThat is the question\u201d said Poirot.",

    "Down at the boathouse a photographic unit\nwas now busy and the fingerprint men and the medical officer had just\narrived.",
    "\u201cThis do for you here all right\u201d asked Sir George.",
    "\u201cVery nicely thank you sir.\u201d\n\u201cWhat am I to do about this show thats going on tell em about it stop\nit or what\u201d\nInspector Bland considered for a moment or two.",
    "\u201cWhat have you done so far Sir George\u201d he asked.",
    "\u201cHavent said anything.",
    "Theres a sort of idea floating round that theres\nbeen an accident.",
    "Nothing more than that.",
    "I dont think anyones suspected\nyet that its  er  well murder.\u201d\n\u201cThen leave things as they are just for the moment\u201d decided Bland.",
    "\u201cThe news will get round fast enough I dare say\u201d he added cynically.",
    "He\nthought again for a moment or two before asking \u201cHow many people do\nyou think there are at this affair\u201d\n\u201cCouple of hundred I should say\u201d answered Sir George \u201cand more\npouring in every moment.",
    "People seem to have come from a good long way\nround.",
    "In fact the whole things being a roaring success.",
    "Damned\nunfortunate.\u201d\nInspector Bland inferred correctly that it was the murder an not the\nsuccess of the f\u043ate to which Sir George was referring.",
    "\u201cA couple of hundred\u201d he mused \u201cand any one of them I suppose\ncould have done it.\u201d\nHe sighed.",
    "\u201cTricky said Sir George sympathetically.",
    "\u201dBut I dont see what reason\nany one of them could have had.",
    "The whole thing seems quite fantastic dont see who would want to go murdering a girl like that.",
    "\u201cHow much can you tell me about the girl She was a local girl I\nunderstand\u201d\n\u201cYes.",
    "Her people live in one of the cottages down near the quay.",
    "Her\nfather works at one of the local farms  Patersons I think.\u201d He added \u201cThe\nmother is here at the f\u043ate this afternoon.",
    "Miss Brewis  thats my secretary\n\n\fand se can tell you about everything much better than I can  Miss Brewis\nwinkled the woman out and has got her somewhere giving her cups of tea.\u201d\n\u201cQuite so\u201d said the inspector approvingly.",
    "\u201cIm not quite clear yet Sir\nGeorge as to the circumstances of all this.",
    "What was the girl doing down\nthere in the boathouse I understand theres some kind of a murder hunt  or\ntreasure hunt going on.\u201d\nSir George nodded.",
    "\u201cYes.",

    "I may have more questions to ask you\nlater.",

    "Who would you like to see first\u201d\n\u201cI think perhaps your secretary Miss Brewis and after that the girls\nmother.\u201d\nSir George nodded and left the room.",
    "The local police constable Robert Hoskins opened the door for him and\nshut it after he went out.",
    "He then volunteered a statement obviously\nintended as a commentary on some of Sir Georges remarks.",

    "\u201cThats why he said she wouldnt be much help.",

    "Foreigner of some sort.",

    "He was silent for a moment doodling with a pencil on a\nsheet of paper in front of him.",
    "Then he asked a question which was clearly\noff the record.",
    "\u201cWho did it Hoskins\u201d he said.",
    "If anyone did have any ideas as to what had been going on Bland\nthought it would be P.C.",
    "Hoskins.",
    "Hoskins was a man of inquisitive mind\nwith a great interest in everybody and everything.",

    "Shes got her old father living with\nher.\u201d\nBland received this information in silence.",

    "\u201cThats why I say it was a foreigner\u201d continued Hoskins.",
    "\u201cOne of those\nthat stop up to the Hostel at Hoodown likely as not.",
    "Theres some queer\nones among them  and a lot of goingson.",
    "Be surprised you would at what\nIve seen em doing in the bushes and the woods Every bit as bad as what\ngoes on in parked cars along the Common.\u201d\nP.C.",
    "Hoskins was by this time an absolute specialist on the subject of\nsexual \u201cgoingson.\u201d They formed a large portion of his conversation when\noff duty and having his pint in the Bull and Bear.",
    "Bland said\n\u201cI dont think there was anything  well of that kind.",
    "The doctor will tell\nus of course as soon as hes finished his examination.\u201d\n\u201cYes sir thatll be up to him that will.",
    "But what I say is you never\nknow with foreigners.",
    "Turn nasty they can all in a moment.\u201d\nInspector Bland sighed as he thought to himself that it was not quite as\neasy as that.",
    "It was all very well for Constable Hoskins to put the blame\nconveniently on \u201cforeigners.\u201d The door opened and the doctor walked in.",

    "\u201cShall they take her away now The other\noutfits have packed up.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cSergeant Cottrill will attend to that\u201d said Bland.",

    "No assault signs of rape or interference of any kind.\u201d\n\u201cNot presumably a sexual crime then\u201d\n\u201cI wouldnt say so no.\u201d The doctor added \u201cI shouldnt say shed been a\nparticularly attractive girl.\u201d\n\u201cWas she fond of the boys\u201d\nBland addressed this question to Constable Hoskins.",
    "\u201cI wouldnt say theyd much use for her\u201d said Constable Hoskins\n\u201cthough maybe shed have liked it if they had.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe\u201d agreed Bland.",

    "\u201cWhat about time of death\u201d he asked.",

    "\u201cJust after halfpast five now\u201d he said.",
    "\u201csay I saw her about twenty past\nfive  shed been dead about an hour.",
    "Roughly that is to say.",
    "Put it between\nfour oclock and twenty to five.",
    "Let you know if theres anything more after\nthe autopsy.\u201d He added \u201cYoull get the proper report with the long words in\ndue course.",
    "Ill be off now.",
    "Ive got some patients to see.\u201d\nHe left the room and Inspector Bland asked Hoskins to fetch Miss\nBrewis.",
    "His spirits rose a little when Miss Brewis came into the room.",
    "Here\n\n\fas he recognised at once was efficiency.",
    "He would get clear answers to his\nquestions definite times and no muddleheadedness.",

    "\u201cI think before I see\nMrs Tucker I would like to hear what you and Lady Stubbs can tell me.\u201d\n\u201cI dont know where Lady Stubbs is\u201d said Miss Brewis acidly.",
    "\u201cI rather\nimagine she got bored with the f\u043ate and has wandered off somewhere but I\ndont expect she can tell you anything more than I can.",
    "What exactly is it\nthat you want to know\u201d\n\u201cI want to know all the details of this murder hunt first and of how this\ngirl Marlene Tucker came to be taking a part in it.\u201d\n\u201cThats quite easy.\u201d\nSuccinctly and clearly Miss Brewis explained the idea of the murder\nhunt as an original attraction for the f\u043ate the engaging of Mrs Oliver the\nwellknown novelist to arrange the matter and a short outline of the plot.",
    "\u201cOriginally\u201d Miss Brewis explained \u201cMrs Alec Legge was to have\ntaken the part of the victim.\u201d\n\u201cMrs Alec Legge\u201d queried the inspector.",
    "Constable Hoskins put in an explanatory word.",
    "\u201cShe and Mr Legge have the Lawders cottage the pink one down by\nMill Creek.",
    "Came here a month ago they did.",
    "Two or three months they got\nit for.\u201d\n\u201cI see.",
    "And Mrs Legge you say was to be the original victim Why was\nthat changed\u201d\n\u201cWell one evening Mrs Legge told all our fortunes and was so good at\nit that it was decided wed have a fortune tellers tent as one of the\nattractions and that Mrs Legge should put on Eastern dress and be Madame\nZuleika and tell fortunes at half a crown a time.",
    "I dont think thats really\nillegal is it.",
    "Inspector I mean its usually done at these kind of f\u043ates.\u201d\nInspector Bland smiled faintly.",
    "\u201cFortune telling and raffles arent always taken too seriously Miss\nBrewis\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cNow and then we have to  er  make an example.\u201d\n\u201cBut usually youre tactful Well thats how it was.",
    "Mrs Legge agreed\nto help us that way and so we had to find somebody else to do the body.",
    "The local Guides were helping us at the f\u043ate and I think someone suggested\nthat one of the Guides would do quite well.\u201d\n\u201cJust who was it who suggested that Miss Brewis\u201d\n\u201cReally I dont quite know...",
    "I think it may have been Mrs Masterton\nthe Members wife.",
    "No perhaps it was Captain Warburton... Really I cant\nbe sure.",
    "But anyway it was suggested.\u201d\n\u201cIs there any reason why this particular girl should have been chosen\u201d\n\u201cNno I dont think so.",
    "Her people are tenants on the estate and her\nmother Mrs Tucker sometimes comes to help in the kitchen.",
    "I dont know\nquite why we settled on her.",
    "Probably her name came to mind first.",
    "We\nasked her and she seemed quite pleased to do it.\u201d\n\u201cShe definitely wanted to do it\u201d\n\u201cOh yes I think she was flattered.",
    "She was a very moronic kind of\ngirl\u201d continued Miss Brewis \u201cshe couldnt have acted a part or anything\nlike that.",
    "But this was all very simple and she felt shed been singled out\nfrom the others and was pleased about it.\u201d\n\u201cWhat exactly was it that she had to do\u201d\n\u201cShe had to stay in the boathouse.",
    "When she heard anyone coming to\nthe door she was to lie down on the floor put the cord round her neck and\nsham dead.\u201d Miss Brewiss tones were calm and businesslike.",
    "The fact that\nthe girl who was to sham dead had actually been found dead did not at the\nmoment appear to affect her emotionally.",
    "\u201cRather a boring way for the girl to spend the afternoon when she might\nhave been at the f\u043ate\u201d suggested Inspector Bland.",
    "\u201cI suppose it was in a way\u201d said Miss Brewis \u201cbut one cant have\neverything can one And Marlene did enjoy the idea of being the body.",
    "It\nmade her feel important.",
    "She had a pile of papers and things to read to keep\nher amused.\u201d\n\u201cAnd something to eat as well\u201d said the inspector.",
    "\u201cI noticed there was\na tray down there with a plate and glass.\u201d\n\u201cOh yes she had a big plate of sweet cakes and a raspberry fruit drink.",
    "I took them down to her myself.\u201d\nBland looked up sharply.",
    "\u201cYou took them down to her When\u201d\n\u201cAbout the middle of the afternoon.\u201d\n\u201cWhat time exactly Can you remember\u201d\nMiss Brewis considered a moment.",
    "\u201cLet me see.",
    "Childrens Fancy Dress was judged there was a little delay\n Lady Stubbs couldnt be found but Mrs Folliat took her place so that was\nall right...",
    "Yes it must have been  Im almost sure  about five minutes past\nfour that I collected the cakes and the fruit drink.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you took them down to her at the boathouse yourself.",
    "What time\ndid you reach there\u201d\n\u201cOh it takes about five minutes to go down to the boathouse  about\nquarter past four I should think.\u201d\n\u201cAnd at quarter past four Marlene Tucker was alive and well\u201d\n\u201cYes of course\u201d said Miss Brewis \u201cand very eager to know how\npeople were getting on with the murder hunt too.",
    "Im afraid I couldnt tell\nher.",
    "Id been too busy with the side shows on the lawn but I did know that a\nlot of people had entered for it.",
    "Twenty or thirty to my own knowledge.",
    "Probably a good many more.\u201d\n\u201cHow did you find Marlene when you arrived at the boathouse\u201d\n\u201cIve just told you.\u201d\n\u201cNo no I dont mean that.",
    "I mean was she lying on the floor shamming\ndead when you opened the door\u201d\n\u201cOh no\u201d said Miss Brewis \u201cbecause I called out just before I got there.",
    "So she opened the door and I took the tray in and put it on the table.\u201d\n\u201cAt a quarter past four\u201d said Bland writing it down \u201cMarlene Tucker\nwas alive and well.",
    "You will understand Im sure Miss Brewis that that is\na very important point.",
    "You are quite sure of your times\u201d\n\u201cI cant be exactly sure because I didnt look at my watch but I had\nlooked at it a short time previously and thats as near as I can get.\u201d She\nadded with a sudden dawning realisation of the inspectors point \u201cDo you\nmean that it was soon after \u201d\n\u201cIt cant have been very long after Miss Brewis.\u201d\n\u201cOh dear\u201d said Miss Brewis.",
    "It was a rather inadequate expression but nevertheless it conveyed well\nenough Miss Brewiss dismay and concern.",
    "\u201cNow Miss Brewis on your way down to the boathouse and on your\nway back again to the house did you meet anybody or see anyone near the\n\n\fboathouse\u201d\nMiss Brewis considered.",
    "\u201cNo\u201d she said \u201cI didnt meet anyone.",
    "I might have of course because\nthe grounds are open to everyone this afternoon.",
    "But on the whole people\ntend to stay round the lawn and the side shows and all that.",
    "They like to go\nround the kitchen gardens and the greenhouses but they dont walk through\nthe woodlands as much as I should have thought they would.",
    "People tend to\nherd together very much at these affairs dont you think so Inspector\u201d\nThe inspector said that that was probably so.",
    "\u201cThough I think\u201d said Miss Brewis with sudden memory \u201cthat there\nwas someone in the Folly.\u201d\n\u201cThe Folly\u201d\n\u201cYes.",
    "A small white temple arrangement.",
    "It was put up just a year or\ntwo ago.",
    "Its to the right of the path as you go down to the boathouse.",
    "There\nwas someone in there.",
    "A courting couple I suspect.",
    "Someone was laughing\nand then someone said Hush.\u201d\n\u201cYou dont know who this courting couple was\u201d\n\u201cIve no idea.",
    "You cant see the front of the Folly from the path.",
    "The\nsides and back enclosed.\u201d\nThe inspector thought for a moment or two but it did not seem likely to\nhim that the couple  whoever they were  in the Folly were important.",
    "Better find out who they were perhaps because they in their turn might\nhave seen someone coming up from or going down to the boathouse.",
    "\u201cAnd there was no one else on the path No one at all\u201d he insisted.",
    "\u201cI see what youre driving at of course\u201d said Miss Brewis.",
    "\u201cI can only\nassure you that I didnt meet anyone.",
    "But then you see I neednt have.",
    "I\nmean if there had been anyone on the path who didnt want me to see them\nits the simplest thing in the world just to slip behind some of the\nrhododendron bushes.",
    "The paths bordered on both sides with shrubs and\nrhododendron bushes.",
    "If anyone who had no business to be there heard\nsomeone coming along the path they could slip out of sight in a moment.\u201d\nThe inspector shifted on to another tack.",
    "\u201cIs there anything you know about this girl yourself that could help\nus\u201d he asked.",
    "\u201cI really know nothing about her\u201d said Miss Brewis.",
    "\u201cI dont think Id\never spoken to her until this affair.",
    "Shes one of the girls Ive seen about  I\nknow her vaguely by sight but thats all.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cAnd you know nothing about her  nothing that could be helpful\u201d\n\u201cI dont know of any reason why anyone should want to murder her\u201d\nsaid Miss Brewis.",
    "\u201cIn fact it seems to me if you know what I mean quite\nimpossible that such a thing should have happened.",
    "I can only think that to\nsome unbalanced mind the fact that she was to be the murdered victim\nmight have induced the wish to make her a real victim.",
    "But even that\nsounds very far fetched and silly.\u201d\nBland sighed.",
    "\u201cOh well\u201d he said \u201cI suppose Id better see the mother now.\u201d\nMrs Tucker was a thin hatchetfaced woman with stringy blonde hair\nand a sharp nose.",
    "Her eyes were reddened with crying but she had herself\nin hand now and was ready to answer the inspectors questions.",
    "\u201cDoesnt seem right that a thing like that should happen\u201d she said.",
    "\u201cYou\nread of these things in the papers but that it should happen to our Marlene\n\u201d\n\u201cIm very very sorry about it\u201d said Inspector Bland gently.",
    "\u201cWhat I\nwant you to do is to think as hard as you can and tell me if there is anyone\nwho could have had any reason to harm the girl\u201d\n\u201cIve been thinking about that already\u201d said Mrs Tucker with a sudden\nsniff.",
    "\u201cThought and thought I have but I cant get anywhere.",
    "Words with\nthe teacher at school Marlene had now and again and shed have her\nquarrels now and again with one of the girls or boys but nothing serious in\nany way.",
    "Theres no one who had a real down on her nobody whod do her\na mischief.\u201d\n\u201cShe never talked to you about anyone who might have been an enemy\nof any kind\u201d\n\u201cShe talked silly often Marlene did but nothing of that kind.",
    "It was all\nmakeup and hairdos and what shed like to do to her face and herself.",
    "You\nknow what girls are.",
    "Far too young she was to put on lipstick and all that\nmuck and her Dad told her so and so did I.",
    "But thats what shed do when\nshe got hold of any money.",
    "Buy herself scent and lipsticks and hide them\naway.\u201d\nBland nodded.",
    "There was nothing here that could help him.",
    "An\nadolescent rather silly girl her head full of film stars and glamour  there\nwere hundreds of Marlenes.",
    "\u201cWhat her Dadll say I dont know\u201d said Mrs Tucker.",
    "\u201cComing here any\nminute hell be expecting to enjoy himself.",
    "Hes a rare shot at the coconuts\n\n\fhe is.\u201d\nShe broke down suddenly and began to sob.",
    "\u201cIf you ask me\u201d she said \u201cits one of them nasty foreigners up at the\nHostel.",
    "You never know where you are with foreigners.",
    "Nice spoken as\nmost of them are some of the shirts they wear you wouldnt believe.",
    "Shirts\nwith girls on them with these bikinis as they call them.",
    "And all of them\nsunning themselves here and there with no shirts at all on  it all leads to\ntrouble.",
    "Thats what I say\u201d\nStill weeping Mrs Tucker was escorted from the room by Constable\nHoskins.",
    "Bland reflected that the local verdict seemed to be the comfortable\nand probably agelong one of attributing every tragic occurrence to\nunspecified foreigners.",
    "Dead Mans Folly\n\n\f\fChapter 8\n\u201cGot a sharp tongue she has\u201d Hoskins said when he returned.",
    "\u201cNags her\nhusband and bullies her old father.",
    "I dare say shes spoke sharp to the girl\nonce or twice and now shes feeling bad about it.",
    "Not that girls mind what\ntheir mothers say to them.",
    "Drops off em like water off a ducks back.\u201d\nInspector Bland cut short these general reflections and told Hoskins to\nfetch Mrs Oliver.",
    "The inspector was slightly startled by the sight of Mrs Oliver.",
    "He had\nnot expected anything so voluminous so purple and in such a state of\nemotional disturbance.",
    "\u201cI feel awful\u201d said Mrs Oliver sinking down in the chair in front of him\nlike a purple blancmange.",
    "\u201cAWFUL\u201d she added in what were clearly\ncapital letters.",

    "This statement was at complete variance\nwith what he had been told about the arrival of Etienne De Sousas letter at\nthe breakfast table.",
    "More than one witness had testified to Lady Stubbs\nhaving been alarmed and upset and very clearly startled at the contents of\nthe letter.",
    "De Sousa returned his stare calmly.",
    "With a little smile he flicked a\nfragment of dust from his knee.",
    "\u201cDid Lady Stubbs reply to your first letter\u201d the inspector asked.",
    "De Sousa hesitated for a moment or two before he answered then he\nsaid\n\u201cIt is so difficult to remember... No I do not think she did.",
    "But it was\nnot necessary.",
    "I was travelling about I had no fixed address.",
    "And besides I\ndo not think my cousin Hattie is very good at writing letters.\u201d He added\n\u201cShe is not you know very intelligent though I understand that she has\ngrown into a very beautiful woman.\u201d\n\u201cYou have not yet seen her\u201d Bland put it in the form of a question and\nDe Sousa showed his teeth in an agreeable smile.",
    "\u201cShe seems to be most unaccountably missing\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cNo doubt this\nesp\u00e8ce de gala bores her.\u201d\nChoosing his words carefully Inspector Bland said\n\u201cHave you any reason to believe Mr De Sousa that your cousin might\nhave some reason for wishing to avoid you\u201d\n\n\f\u201cHattie wish to avoid me Really I do not see why.",
    "What reason could\nshe have\u201d\n\u201cThat is what I am asking you Mr De Sousa.\u201d\n\u201cYou think that Hattie has absented herself from this f\u043ate in order to\navoid me What an absurd idea.\u201d\n\u201cShe had no reason as far as you know to be  shall we say  afraid of\nyou in any way\u201d\n\u201cAfraid  of me\u201d De Sousas voice was sceptical and amused.",
    "\u201cBut if I\nmay say so.",
    "Inspector what a fantastic idea\u201d\n\u201cYour relations with her have always been quite amicable\u201d\n\u201cIt is as I have told you.",
    "I have had no relations with her.",
    "I have not seen\nher since she was a child of fourteen.\u201d\n\u201cYet you look her up when you come to England\u201d\n\u201cOh as to that I had seen a paragraph about her in one of your society\npapers.",
    "It mentions her maiden name and that she is married to this rich\nEnglishman and I think I must see what the little Hattie has turned into.",
    "Whether her brains now work better than they used to do.\u201d He shrugged his\nshoulders again.",
    "\u201cIt was a mere cousinly politeness.",
    "A gentle curiosity  no\nmore.\u201d\nAgain the inspector stared hard at De Sousa.",
    "What he wondered was\ngoing on behind the mocking smooth fa\u0437ade He adopted a more\nconfidential manner.",
    "\u201cI wonder if you can perhaps tell me a little more about your cousin\nHer character her reactions\u201d\nDe Sousa appeared politely surprised.",
    "\u201cReally  has this anything to do with the murder of the girl in the\nboathouse which I understand is the real matter with which you occupy\nyourself\u201d\n\u201cIt might have a connection\u201d said Inspector Bland.",
    "De Sousa studied him for a moment or two in silence.",
    "Then he said with\na slight shrug of the shoulders\n\u201cI never knew my cousin at all well.",
    "She was a unit in a large family\nand not particularly interesting to me.",
    "But in answer to your question I\nwould say to you that although mentally weak she was not as far as I\nknow ever possessed by any homicidal tendencies.\u201d\n\u201cReally Mr De Sousa I wasnt suggesting that\u201d\n\n\f\u201cWerent you I wonder.",
    "I can see no other reason for your question.",
    "No\nunless Hattie has changed very much she is not homicidal.\u201d He rose.",
    "\u201cI am\nsure that you cannot want to ask me anything further Inspector.",
    "I can only\nwish you every possible success in tracking down the murderer.\u201d\n\u201cYou are not thinking of leaving Helmmouth for a day or two I hope\nMr De Sousa\u201d\n\u201cYou speak very politely Inspector.",
    "Is that an order\u201d\n\u201cJust a request sir.\u201d\n\u201cThank you.",
    "I propose to stay in Helmmouth for two days.",
    "Sir George\nhas very kindly asked me to come and stay in the house but I prefer to\nremain on the Esp\u00e9rance.",
    "If you should want to ask me any further\nquestions that is where you will find me.\u201d\nHe bowed politely.",
    "P.C.",
    "Hoskins opened the door for him and he went out.",
    "\u201cSmarmy sort of fellow\u201d muttered the inspector to himself.",
    "\u201cAah\u201d said P.C.",
    "Hoskins in complete agreement.",
    "\u201cSay she is homicidal if you like\u201d went on the inspector to himself.",

    "\u201cThe question really is how barmy is she\u201d\nHoskins shook his head sapiently.",
    "\u201cGot a low I.Q.",
    "I reckon\u201d he said.",

    "I dont care if\nshes got a high I.Q.",
    "or a low I.Q.",
    "All I care about is is she the sort of\nwoman whod think it funny or desirable or necessary to put a cord round\na girls neck and strangle her And where the devil is the woman anyway\nGo out and see how Franks getting on.\u201d\nHoskins left obediently and returned a moment or two later with\nSergeant Cottrell a brisk young man with a good opinion of himself who\nalways managed to annoy his superior officer.",
    "Inspector Bland much\npreferred the rural wisdom of Hoskins to the smart knowall attitude of\nFrank Cottrell.",
    "\u201cStill searching the grounds sir\u201d said Cottrell.",
    "\u201cThe lady hasnt passed\nout through the gate were quite sure of that.",
    "Its the second gardener whos\nthere giving out the tickets and taking the admission money.",
    "Hell swear she\nhasnt left.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cThere are other ways of leaving than by the main gate I suppose\u201d\n\u201cOh yes sir.",
    "Theres the path down to the ferry but the old boy down\nthere  Merdell his name is  is also quite positive that she hasnt left that\nway.",
    "Hes about a hundred but pretty reliable I think.",
    "He described quite\nclearly how the foreign gentleman arrived in his launch and asked the way\nto Nasse House.",
    "The old man told him he must go up the road to the gate\nand pay for admission.",
    "But he said the gentleman seemed to know nothing\nabout the f\u043ate and said he was a relation of the family.",
    "So the old man set\nhim on the path up from the ferry through the woods.",
    "Merdell seems to\nhave been hanging about the quay all the afternoon so hed be pretty sure to\nhave seen her ladyship if shed come that way.",
    "Then theres the top gate that\nleads over the fields to Hoodown Park but thats been wired up because of\ntrespassers so she didnt go through there.",
    "Seems as though she must be\nstill here doesnt it\u201d\n\u201cThat may be so\u201d said the inspector \u201cbut theres nothing to prevent her\nis there from slipping under a fence and going off across country Sir\nGeorge is still complaining of trespassing here from the hostel next door I\nunderstand.",
    "If you can get in the way the trespassers get in you can get out\nthe same way I suppose.\u201d\n\u201cOh yes sir indubitably sir.",
    "But Ive talked to her maid sir.",
    "Shes\nwearing \u201d Cottrell consulted a paper in his hand  \u201ca dress of cyclamen\ncr\u043ape georgette whatever that is a large black hat black court shoes with\nfourinch french heels.",
    "Not the sort of things youd wear for a crosscountry\nrun.\u201d\n\u201cShe didnt change her clothes\u201d\n\u201cNo.",

    "She didnt pack a suitcase or anything of that kind.",
    "She didnt\neven change her shoes.",
    "Every pairs there and accounted for.\u201d\nInspector Bland frowned.",
    "Unpleasant possibilities were rising in his\nmind.",
    "He said curtly\n\u201cGet me that secretary woman again  Bruce  whatever her name is.\u201d\n\n\fDead Mans Folly\nII\nMiss Brewis came in looking rather more ruffled than usual and a little\nout of breath.",
    "\u201cYes Inspector\u201d she said.",
    "\u201cYou wanted me If it isnt urgent.",
    "Sir\nGeorge is in a terrible state and \u201d\n\u201cWhats he in a state about\u201d\n\u201cHes only just realised that Lady Stubbs is  well really missing.",
    "I told\nhim shes probably only gone for a walk in the woods or something but hes\ngot it into his head that somethings happened to her.",
    "Quite absurd.\u201d\n\u201cIt might not be so absurd Miss Brewis.",
    "After all weve had one murder here this afternoon.\u201d\n\u201cYou surely dont think that Lady Stubbs  But thats ridiculous Lady\nStubbs can look after herself.\u201d\n\u201cCan she\u201d\n\u201cOf course she can Shes a grown woman isnt she\u201d\n\u201cBut rather a helpless one by all accounts \u201d\n\u201cNonsense\u201d said Miss Brewis.",
    "\u201cIt suits Lady Stubbs now and then to\nplay the helpless nitwit if she doesnt want to do anything.",
    "It takes her\nhusband and in I dare say but it doesnt take me in\u201d\n\u201cYou dont like her very much Miss Brewis\u201d\nBland sounded gently interested.",
    "Miss Brewiss lips closed in a thin line.",
    "\u201cIts not my business either to like or dislike her\u201d she said.",
    "The door burst open and Sir George came in.",
    "\u201cLook here\u201d he said violently \u201cyouve got to do something.",
    "Wheres\nHattie Youve got to find Hattie.",
    "What the hells going on round here I\ndont know.",
    "This confounded f\u043ate  some ruddy homicidal maniacs got in\nhere paying his halfcrown and looking like everyone else spending his\nafternoon going round murdering people.",
    "Thats what it looks like to me.\u201d\n\u201cI dont think we need take such an exaggerated view as that Sir\nGeorge.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cIts all very well for you sitting there behind the table writing things\ndown.",
    "What I want is my wife.\u201d\n\u201cIm having the grounds searched Sir George.\u201d\n\u201cWhy did nobody tell me shed disappeared Shes been missing a\ncouple of hours now it seems.",
    "I thought it was odd that she didnt turn up to\njudge the Childrens Fancy Dress stuff but nobody told me shed really\ngone.\u201d\n\u201cNobody knew\u201d said the inspector.",
    "\u201cWell someone ought tove known.",
    "Somebody ought to have noticed.\u201d\nHe turned on Miss Brewis.",
    "\u201cYou ought to have known Amanda you were keeping an eye on\nthings.\u201d\n\u201cI cant be everywhere\u201d said Miss Brewis.",
    "She sounded suddenly\nalmost tearful.",
    "\u201cIve got so much to see to.",
    "If Lady Stubbs chose to wander\naway \u201d\n\u201cWander away Why should she wander away Shed no reason to\nwander away unless she wanted to avoid that dago fellow.\u201d\nBland seized his opportunity.",
    "\u201cThere is something I want to ask you\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cDid your wife receive\na letter from Mr De Sousa some three weeks ago telling her he was coming\nto this country\u201d\nSir George looked astonished.",
    "\u201cNo of course she didnt.\u201d\n\u201cYoure sure of that\u201d\n\u201cOh quite sure.",
    "Hattie would have told me.",
    "Why she was thoroughly\nstartled and upset when she got his letter this morning.",
    "It more or less\nknocked her out.",
    "She was lying down most of the morning with a\nheadache.\u201d\n\u201cWhat did she say to you privately about her cousins visit Why did she\ndread seeing him so much\u201d\nSir George looked rather embarrassed.",
    "\u201cBlessed if I really know\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cShe just kept saying that he was\nwicked.\u201d\n\u201cWicked In what way\u201d\n\u201cShe wasnt very articulate about it.",
    "Just went on rather like a child\nsaying that he was a wicked man.",
    "Bad and that she wished he wasnt\ncoming here.",
    "She said hed done bad things.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cDone bad things When\u201d\n\u201cOh long ago.",
    "I should imagine this Etienne De Sousa was the black\nsheep of the family and that Hattie picked up odds and ends about him\nduring her childhood without understanding them very well.",
    "And as a result\nshes got a sort of horror of him.",
    "I thought it was just a childish hangover\nmyself.",
    "My wife is rather childish sometimes.",
    "Has likes and dislikes but\ncant explain them.\u201d\n\u201cYou are sure she did not particularise in any way Sir George\u201d\nSir George looked uneasy.",
    "\u201cI wouldnt want you to go by  er  by what she said.\u201d\n\u201cThen she did say something\u201d\n\u201cAll right.",

    "\u201cShe\nkept repeating it and saying He kills people but she couldnt tell me who\nhe killed or when or why.",
    "I thought myself it was just some queer childlike\nmemory  trouble with the natives  something like that.\u201d\n\u201cYou say she couldnt tell you anything definite  do you mean couldnt\nSir George  or might it have been wouldnt\u201d\n\u201cI dont think...\u201d He broke off.",
    "\u201cI dont know.",
    "Youve muddled me.",
    "As I\nsay I didnt take any of it seriously.",

    "Its difficult to explain\nto you because you dont know my wife.",
    "I am devoted to her but half the\ntime I dont listen to what she says because it just doesnt make sense.",
    "Anyway this De Sousa fellow couldnt have had anything to do with all this\n dont tell me he lands here off a yacht and goes straight away through the\nwoods and kills a wretched Girl Guide in a boathouse Why should he\u201d\n\u201cIm not suggesting that anything like that happened\u201d said Inspector\nBland \u201cbut you must realise Sir George that in looking for the murderer of\nMarlene Tucker the field is a more restricted one than one might think at\nfirst.\u201d\n\u201cRestricted\u201d Sir George stared.",
    "\u201cYouve got the whole ruddy f\u043ate to\nchoose from havent you Two hundred  three hundred  people Any one\nof em might have done it.\u201d\n\u201cYes I thought so at first but from what Ive learnt now thats hardly so.",
    "The boathouse door has a Yale lock.",
    "Nobody could come in from outside\nwithout a key.\u201d\n\u201cWell there were three keys.\u201d\n\u201cExactly.",
    "One key was the final clue in this Murder Hunt.",
    "It is still\nconcealed in the hydrangea walk at the very top of the garden.",
    "The second\nkey was in the possession of Mrs Oliver the organiser of the Murder Hunt.",
    "Where is the third key Sir George\u201d\n\u201cIt ought to be in the drawer of that desk where youre sitting.",
    "No the\nrighthand one with a lot of the other estate duplicates.\u201d\nHe came over and rummaged in the drawer.",
    "\u201cYes.",
    "Here it is all right.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cThen you see\u201d said Inspector Bland \u201cwhat that means The only\npeople who could have got into the boathouse were first the person who\nhad completed the Murder Hunt and found the key which as far as we\nknow did not happen.",
    "Second Mrs Oliver or some member of the\nhousehold to whom she may have lent her key and third someone whom\nMarlene herself admitted to the room.\u201d\n\u201cWell that latter point covers pretty well everyone doesnt it\u201d\n\u201cVery far from it\u201d said Inspector Bland.",
    "\u201cIf I understand the\narrangement of this Murder Hunt correctly when the girl heard anyone\napproaching the door she was to lie down and enact the part of the Victim\nand wait to be discovered by the person who had found the last clue  the\nkey.",
    "Therefore as you must see for yourself the only people whom she\nwould have admitted had they called to her from outside and asked her to\ndo so were the people who had actually arranged the Murder Hunt.",
    "Any\ninmate that is of this house  that is to say yourself Lady Stubbs Miss\nBrewis Mrs Oliver  possibly M. Poirot whom I believe she had met this\nmorning.",
    "Who else Sir George\u201d\nSir George considered for a moment or two.",
    "\u201cThe Legges of course\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cAlec and Sally Legge.",
    "Theyve been\nin it from the start.",

    "And Warburton the Mastertons  oh\nand Mrs Folliat of course.\u201d\n\u201cThat is all  nobody else\u201d\n\u201cThats the lot.\u201d\n\u201cSo you see.",
    "Sir George it is not a very wide field.\u201d\nSir Georges face went scarlet.",
    "\u201cI think youre talking nonsense  absolute nonsense Are you\nsuggesting  what are you suggesting\u201d\n\u201cIm only suggesting\u201d said Inspector Bland \u201cthat theres a great deal we\ndont know as yet.",
    "Its possible for instance that Marlene for some reason\ncame out of the boathouse.",
    "She may even have been strangled somewhere\nelse and her body brought back and arranged on the floor.",
    "But even if so\nwhoever arranged her was again someone who was thoroughly cognisant\nwith all the details of the Murder Hunt.",
    "We always come back to that.\u201d He\nadded in a slightly changed voice \u201cI can assure you Sir George that were\ndoing all we can to find Lady Stubbs.",

    "Dear Lady Stubbss mind revolves entirely round herself.\u201d\n\u201cIm still waiting Mr Weyman for your answer to my question\u201d\n\u201cWhere I was between fourfifteen and five oclock Well really.",
    "Inspector I cant say offhand.",
    "I was about  if you know what I mean.\u201d\n\u201cAbout where\u201d\n\u201cOh here and there.",
    "I mingled a bit on the lawn watched the locals\namusing themselves had a word or two with the fluttery film star.",
    "Then\nwhen I got sick of it all I went along to the tennis court and mused over the\ndesign for the Pavilion.",
    "I also wondered how soon someone would identify\nthe photograph that was the first clue for the Murder Hunt with a section of\ntennis net.\u201d\n\u201cDid someone identify it\u201d\n\u201cYes I believe someone did come along but I wasnt really noticing by\nthen.",
    "I got a new idea about the Pavilion  a way of making the best of two\nworlds.",
    "My own and Sir Georges.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cAnd after that\u201d\n\u201cAfter that Well I strolled around and came back to the house.",
    "I\nstrolled down to the quay and had a crack with old Merdell then came\nback.",
    "I cant fix any of the times with any accuracy.",
    "I was as I said in the\nfirst place about Thats all there is to it.\u201d\n\u201cWell Mr Weyman\u201d said the inspector briskly \u201cI expect we can get\nsome confirmation of all this.\u201d\n\u201cMerdell can tell you that I talked to him on the quay.",
    "But of course\nthatll be rather later than the time youre interested in.",
    "Must have been after\nfive when I got down there.",
    "Very unsatisfactory isnt it Inspector\u201d\n\u201cWe shall be able to narrow it down I expect Mr Weyman.\u201d\nThe inspectors tone was pleasant but there was a steely ring in it that\ndid not escape the young architects notice.",
    "He sat down on the arm of a\nchair.",
    "\u201cSeriously\u201d he said \u201cwho can have wanted to murder that girl\u201d\n\u201cYouve no ideas yourself Mr Weyman\u201d\n\u201cWell offhand Id say it was our prolific authoress the Purple Peril.",
    "Have you seen her imperial purple getup I suggest that she went a bit off\nher onion and thought how much better the Murder Hunt would be if there\nwas a real body.",
    "Hows that\u201d\n\u201cIs that a serious suggestion Mr Weyman\u201d\n\u201cIts the only probability I can think of.\u201d\n\u201cTheres one other thing I would like to ask you Mr Weyman.",
    "Did you\nsee Lady Stubbs during the course of the afternoon\u201d\n\u201cOf course I saw her.",
    "Who could miss her Dressed up like a\nmannequin of Jacques Fath of Christian Dior\u201d\n\u201cWhen did you see her last\u201d\n\u201cLast I dont know.",
    "Striking an attitude on the lawn about halfpast\nthree  or a quarter to four perhaps.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you didnt see her after that\u201d\n\u201cNo.",
    "Why\u201d\n\u201cI wondered  because after four oclock nobody seems to have seen her.",
    "Lady Stubbs has  vanished Mr Weyman.\u201d\n\u201cVanished Our Hattie\u201d\n\u201cThat surprises you\u201d\n\u201cYes it does rather... Whats she up to I wonder\u201d\n\u201cDyou know Lady Stubbs well Mr Weyman\u201d\n\n\f\u201cNever met her till I came down here four or five days ago.\u201d\n\u201cHave you formed any opinions about her\u201d\n\u201cI should say she knows which side her bread is buttered better than\nmost\u201d said Michael Weyman dryly.",
    "\u201cA very ornamental young woman and\nknows how to make the most of it.\u201d\n\u201cBut mentally not very active Is that right\u201d\n\u201cDepends what you mean by mentally\u201d said Michael Weyman.",
    "\u201cI\nwouldnt describe her as an intellectual.",
    "But if youre thinking that shes not\nall there youre wrong.\u201d A tone of bitterness came into his voice.",
    "\u201cId say\nshe was very much all there.",
    "Nobody more so.\u201d\nThe inspectors eyebrows rose.",
    "\u201cThats not the generally accepted opinion.\u201d\n\u201cFor some reason she likes playing the dim nitwit.",
    "I dont know why.",
    "But as Ive said before in my opinion shes very much all there.\u201d\nThe inspector studied him for a moment then he said\n\u201cAnd you really cant get any nearer to exact times and places between\nthe hours I have mentioned\u201d\n\u201cSorry.\u201d Weyman spoke jerkily.",
    "\u201cIm afraid I cant.",
    "Rotten memory\nnever any good about time.\u201d He added \u201cFinished with me\u201d\nAs the inspector nodded he left the room quickly.",
    "\u201cAnd Id like to know\u201d said the inspector half to himself and half to\nHoskins \u201cwhat theres been between him and her Ladyship.",
    "Either hes\nmade a pass at her and shes turned him down or theres been some kind of\na dustup.\u201d He went on \u201cWhat would you say was the general opinion\nround these parts about Sir George and his lady\u201d\n\u201cShes daft\u201d said Constable Hoskins.",
    "\u201cI know you think that Hoskins.",
    "Is that the accepted view\u201d\n\u201cId say so.\u201d\n\u201cAnd Sir George  is he liked\u201d\n\u201cHes liked well enough.",
    "Hes a good sportsman and he knows a bit\nabout farming.",
    "The old ladys done a lot to help.\u201d\n\u201cWhat old lady\u201d\n\u201cMrs Folliat who lives at the Lodge here.\u201d\n\u201cOh of course.",
    "The Folliats used to own this place didnt they\u201d\n\u201cYes and its owing to the old lady that Sir George and Lady Stubbs\nhave been taken up as well as they have.",
    "Got em in with the nobs\neverywhere she has.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cPaid for doing so do you think\u201d\n\u201cOh no not Mrs Folliat.\u201d Hoskins sounded shocked.",
    "\u201cI understand she\nknew Lady Stubbs before she was married and it was she who urged on Sir\nGeorge to buy this place.\u201d\n\u201cIll have to talk to Mrs Folliat\u201d said the inspector.",
    "\u201cAh shes a shrewd old lady she is.",
    "If anything is going on shed know\nabout it.\u201d\n\u201cI must talk to her\u201d said the inspector.",
    "\u201cI wonder where she is now.\u201d\n\n\fDead Mans Folly\n\n\f\fChapter 11\nMrs Folliat was at that moment being talked to by Hercule Poirot in the\nbig drawingroom.",
    "He had found her there leaning back in a chair in a\ncorner of the room.",
    "She had started nervously when he came in.",
    "Then\nsinking back she had murmured\n\u201cOh its you M. Poirot.\u201d\n\u201cI apologise Madame.",
    "I disturbed you.\u201d\n\u201cNo no.",
    "You dont disturb me.",
    "Im just resting thats all.",
    "Im not as\nyoung as I was.",
    "The shock  it was too much for me.\u201d\n\u201cI comprehend\u201d said Poirot.",
    "\u201cIndeed I comprehend.\u201d\nMrs Folliat a handkerchief clutched in her small hand was staring up at\nthe ceiling.",
    "She said in a voice halfstifled with emotion\n\u201cI can hardly bear to think of it.",
    "That poor girl.",
    "That poor poor girl \u201d\n\u201cI know\u201d said Poirot.",
    "\u201cI know.\u201d\n\u201cSo young\u201d said Mrs Folliat \u201cjust at the beginning of life.\u201d She said\nagain \u201cI can hardly bear to think of it.\u201d\nPoirot looked at her curiously.",
    "She seemed he thought to have aged by\nabout ten years since the time early in the afternoon when he had seen her\nthe gracious hostess welcoming her guests.",
    "Now her face seemed drawn\nand haggard with the lines in it clearly marked.",
    "\u201cYou said to me only yesterday Madame it is a very wicked world.\u201d\n\u201cDid I say that\u201d Mrs Folliat seemed startled.",
    "\u201cIts true... Oh yes Im\nonly just beginning to know how true it is.\u201d She added in a low voice \u201cBut\nI never thought anything like this would happen.\u201d\nAgain he looked at her curiously.",
    "\u201cWhat did you think would happen then Something\u201d\n\u201cNo no.",
    "I didnt mean that.\u201d\nPoirot persisted.",
    "\u201cBut you did expect something to happen  something out of the usual.\u201d\n\u201cYou misunderstand me M. Poirot.",
    "I only mean that its the last thing\nyou would expect to happen in the middle of a f\u043ate like this.\u201d\n\u201cLady Stubbs this morning also spoke of wickedness.\u201d\n\u201cHattie did Oh dont speak of her to me  dont speak of her.",
    "I dont\nwant to think about her.\u201d She was silent for a moment or two and then said\n\u201cWhat did she say  about wickedness\u201d\n\n\f\u201cShe was speaking of her cousin.",
    "Etienne De Sousa.",
    "She said that he\nwas wicked that he was a bad man.",
    "She said too that she was afraid of\nhim.\u201d\nHe watched but she merely shook her head incredulously.",
    "\u201cEtienne De Sousa  who is he\u201d\n\u201cOf course you were not at breakfast.",
    "I forgot Mrs Folliat.",
    "Lady Stubbs\nreceived a letter from this cousin of hers whom she had not seen since she\nwas a girl of fifteen.",
    "He told her that he proposed to call upon her today\nthis afternoon.\u201d\n\u201cAnd did he come\u201d\n\u201cYes.",
    "He arrived here about halfpast four.\u201d\n\u201cSurely  dyou mean that rather handsome dark young man who came\nup the ferry path I wondered who he was at the time.\u201d\n\u201cYes Madame that was Mr De Sousa.\u201d\nMrs Folliat said energetically\n\u201cIf I were you I should pay no attention to the things Hattie says.\u201d She\nflushed as Poirot looked at her in surprise and went on \u201cShe is like a child I mean she uses terms like a child  wicked good.",
    "No half shades.",
    "I\nshouldnt pay any attention to what she tells you about this Etienne De\nSousa.\u201d\nAgain Poirot wondered.",
    "He said slowly\n\u201cYou know Lady Stubbs very well do you not Mrs Folliat\u201d\n\u201cProbably as well as anyone knows her.",
    "Possibly even better than her\nhusband knows her.",
    "And if I do\u201d\n\u201cWhat is she really like Madame\u201d\n\u201cWhat a very odd question M. Poirot.\u201d\n\u201cYou know do you not Madame that Lady Stubbs cannot be found\nanywhere\u201d\nAgain her answer surprised him.",
    "She expressed no concern or\nastonishment.",
    "She said\n\u201cSo she has run away has she I see.\u201d\n\u201cIt seems to you quite natural that\u201d\n\u201cNatural Oh I dont know.",
    "Hattie is rather unaccountable.\u201d\n\u201cDo you think she has run away because she has a guilty conscience\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean M. Poirot\u201d\n\u201cHer cousin was talking about her this afternoon.",
    "He mentioned\ncasually that she had always been mentally subnormal.",
    "I think you must\n\n\fknow Madame that people who are subnormal mentally are not always\naccountable for their actions.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you trying to say M. Poirot\u201d\n\u201cSuch people are as you say very simple  like children.",
    "In a sudden fit\nof rage they might even kill.\u201d\nMrs Folliat turned on him in sudden anger.",
    "\u201cHattie was never like that I wont allow you to say such things.",
    "She\nwas a gentle warmhearted girl even if she was  a little simple mentally.",
    "Hattie would never have killed anyone.\u201d\nShe faced him breathing hard still indignant.",
    "Poirot wondered.",
    "He wondered very much.",
    "Dead Mans Folly\nII\nBreaking into this scene P.C.",
    "Hoskins made his appearance.",
    "He said in an apologetic manner\n\u201cIve been looking for you maam.\u201d\n\u201cGood evening Hoskins.\u201d Mrs Folliat was once more her poised self\nagain the mistress of Nasse House.",
    "\u201cYes what is it\u201d\n\u201cThe inspectors compliments and hed be glad to have a word with you\n if you feels up to it that is\u201d Hoskins hastened to add noting as Hercule\nPoirot had done the effects of shock.",
    "\u201cOf course I feel up to it.\u201d Mrs Folliat rose to her feet.",
    "She followed\nHoskins out of the room.",
    "Poirot having risen politely sat down again and\nstared up at the ceiling with a puzzled frown.",
    "The inspector rose when Mrs Folliat entered and the constable held the\nchair for her to sit down.",
    "\u201cIm sorry to worry you Mrs Folliat\u201d said Bland.",
    "\u201cBut I imagine that\nyou know all the people in the neighbourhood and I think you may be able\nto help us.\u201d\nMrs Folliat smiled faintly.",
    "\u201cI expect\u201d she said\u201c that I know everyone\nround here as well as anyone could do.",
    "What do you want to know\nInspector\u201d\n\u201cYou knew the Tuckers The family and the girl\u201d\n\u201cOh yes of course theyve always been tenants on the estate.",
    "Mrs\nTucker was the youngest of a large family.",
    "Her eldest brother was our head\ngardener.",
    "She married Alfred Tucker who is a farm labourer  a stupid man\nbut very nice.",
    "Mrs Tucker is a bit of a shrew.",
    "A good housewife you know\nand very clean in the house but Tucker is never allowed to come anywhere\nfarther than the scullery with his muddy boots on.",
    "All that sort of thing.",
    "She\nnags the children rather.",
    "Most of them have married and gone into jobs now.",
    "There was just this poor child Marlene left and three younger children.",
    "Two boys and a girl still at school.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cNow knowing the family as you do Mrs Folliat can you think of any\nreason why Marlene should have been killed today\u201d\n\u201cNo indeed I cant.",
    "Its quite quite unbelievable if you know what I\nmean Inspector.",
    "There was no boyfriend or anything of that kind or I\nshouldnt think so.",
    "Not that Ive ever heard of anyway.\u201d\n\u201cNow what about the people whove been taking part in this Murder\nHunt Can you tell me anything about them\u201d\n\u201cWell Mrs Oliver Id never met before.",
    "She is quite unlike my idea of\nwhat a crime novelist would be.",
    "Shes very upset poor dear by what has\nhappened  naturally.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what about the other helpers  Captain Warburton for instance\u201d\n\u201cI dont see any reason why he should murder Marlene Tucker if thats\nwhat youre asking me\u201d said Mrs Folliat composedly.",
    "\u201cI dont like him very\nmuch.",
    "Hes what I call a foxy sort of man but I suppose one has to be up to\nall the political tricks and all that kind of thing if one is a political agent.",
    "Hes certainly energetic and has worked very hard over this f\u043ate.",
    "I dont\nthink he could have killed the girl anyway because he was on the lawn the\nwhole time this afternoon.\u201d\nThe inspector nodded.",
    "\u201cAnd the Legges.",
    "What do you know about the Legges\u201d\n\u201cWell they seem a very nice young couple.",
    "Hes inclined to be what I\nshould call  moody.",
    "I dont know very much about him.",
    "She was a Carstairs\nbefore her marriage and I know some relations of hers very well.",
    "They took\nthe Mill cottage for two months and I hope theyve enjoyed their holiday\nhere.",
    "Weve all got very friendly together.\u201d\n\u201cShes an attractive lady I understand.\u201d\n\u201cOh yes very attractive.\u201d\n\u201cWould you say that at any time Sir George had felt that attraction\u201d\nMrs Folliat looked rather astonished.",
    "\u201cOh no Im sure there was nothing of that kind.",
    "Sir George is really\nabsorbed by his business and very fond of his wife.",
    "Hes not at all a\nphilandering sort of man.\u201d\n\u201cAnd there was nothing you would say between Lady Stubbs and Mr\nLegge\u201d\nAgain Mrs Folliat shook her head.",
    "\u201cOh no positively.\u201d\nThe inspector persisted.",
    "\u201cTheres been no trouble of any kind between Sir George and his wife\nthat you know of\u201d\n\u201cIm sure there hasnt\u201d said Mrs Folliat emphatically.",
    "\u201cAnd I would\nknow if there had been.\u201d\n\u201cIt wouldnt be then as a result of any disagreement between husband\nand wife that Lady Stubbs has gone away\u201d\n\u201cOh no.\u201d She added lightly \u201cThe silly girl.",
    "I understand didnt want to\nmeet this cousin of hers.",
    "Some childish phobia.",
    "So shes run away just like a\nchild might do.\u201d\n\u201cThats your opinion.",
    "Nothing more than that\u201d\n\u201cOh no.",
    "I expect shell turn up again quite soon.",
    "Feeling rather ashamed\nof herself.\u201d She added carelessly \u201cWhats become of this cousin by the\nway Is he still here in the house\u201d\n\u201cI understand hes gone back to his yacht.\u201d\n\u201cAnd thats at Helmmouth is it\u201d\n\u201cYes at Helmmouth.\u201d\n\u201cI see\u201d said Mrs Folliat.",
    "\u201cWell its rather unfortunate  Hattie behaving\nso childishly.",
    "However if hes staying on here for a day or so we can make\nher see she must behave properly.\u201d\nIt was the inspector thought a question but although he noticed it he\ndid not answer it.",
    "\u201cYou are probably thinking\u201d he said \u201cthat all this is rather beside the\npoint.",
    "But you do understand dont you Mrs Folliat that we have to range\nover rather a wide field.",
    "Miss Brewis for instance.",
    "What do you know\nabout Miss Brewis\u201d\n\u201cWell shes an excellent secretary.",
    "More than a secretary.",
    "She\npractically acts as housekeeper down here.",
    "In fact I dont know what theyd\ndo without her.\u201d\n\u201cWas she Sir Georges secretary before he married his wife\u201d\n\u201cI think so.",
    "Im not quite sure.",
    "Ive only known her since she came down\nhere with them.\u201d\n\u201cShe doesnt like Lady Stubbs very much does she\u201d\n\u201cNo\u201d said Mrs Folliat \u201cIm afraid she doesnt.",
    "I dont think these good\nsecretaries ever do care for wives much if you know what I mean.",
    "Perhaps\nits natural.\u201d\n\u201cWas it you or Lady Stubbs who asked Miss Brewis to take cakes and a\nfruit drink to the girl in the boathouse\u201d\n\n\fMrs Folliat looked slightly surprised.",
    "\u201cI remember Miss Brewis collecting some cakes and things and saying\nshe was taking them along to Marlene.",
    "I didnt know anyone had\nparticularly asked her to do it or arranged about it.",
    "It certainly wasnt me.\u201d\n\u201cI see.",
    "You say you were in the tea tent from four oclock on.",
    "I believe\nMrs Legge was also having tea in the tent at that time.\u201d\n\u201cMrs Legge No I dont think so.",
    "At least I dont remember seeing her\nthere.",
    "In fact Im quite sure she wasnt there.",
    "Wed had a great influx by the\nbus from Torquay and I remember looking round the tent and thinking that\nthey must all be summer visitors there was hardly a face there that I knew.",
    "I think Mrs Legge must have come in to tea later.\u201d\n\u201cOh well\u201d said the inspector \u201cit doesnt matter.\u201d He added smoothly\n\u201cWell I really think thats all.",
    "Thank you Mrs Folliat youve been very\nkind.",
    "We can only hope that Lady Stubbs will return shortly.\u201d\n\u201cI hope so too\u201d said Mrs Folliat.",
    "\u201cVery thoughtless of the dear child\ngiving us all so much anxiety.\u201d She spoke briskly but the animation in her\nvoice was not very natural.",
    "\u201cIm sure\u201d said Mrs Folliat \u201cthat shes quite all\nright.",
    "Quite all right.\u201d\nAt that moment the door opened and an attractive young woman with\nred hair and a freckled face came in and said\n\u201cI hear youve been asking for me\u201d\n\u201cThis is Mrs Legge Inspector\u201d said Mrs Folliat.",
    "\u201cSally dear I dont\nknow whether youve heard about the terrible thing that has happened\u201d\n\u201cOh yes Ghastly isnt it\u201d said Mrs Legge.",
    "She uttered an exhausted\nsigh and sank down in the chair as Mrs Folliat left the room.",
    "\u201cIm terribly sorry about all this\u201d she said.",
    "\u201cIt seems really\nunbelievable if you know what I mean.",
    "Im afraid I cant help you in any\nway.",
    "You see Ive been telling fortunes all the afternoon so I havent seen\nanything of what was going on.\u201d\n\u201cI know Mrs Legge.",
    "But we just have to ask everybody the same\nroutine questions.",
    "For instance just where were you between fourfifteen\nand five oclock\u201d\n\u201cWell I went and had tea at four oclock.\u201d\n\u201cIn the tea tent\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cIt was very crowded I believe\u201d\n\u201cOh frightfully crowded.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cDid you see anyone you knew there\u201d\n\u201cOh a few old people yes.",
    "Nobody to speak to.",
    "Goodness how I\nwanted that tea That was four oclock as I say.",
    "I got back to the fortune\ntelling tent at halfpast four and went on with my job.",
    "And goodness knows\nwhat I was promising the women in the end.",
    "Millionaire husbands film\nstardom in Hollywood  heaven knows what.",
    "Mere journeys across the sea\nand suspicious dark women seemed too tame.\u201d\n\u201cWhat happened during the halfhour when you were absent  I mean\nsupposing people wanted to have their fortunes told\u201d\n\u201cOh I hung a card up outside the tent.",
    "Back at fourthirty.\u201d\nThe inspector made a note in his pad.",
    "\u201cWhen did you last see Lady Stubbs\u201d\n\u201cHattie I dont really know.",
    "She was quite near at hand when I came\nout of the fortune telling tent to go to tea but I didnt speak to her.",
    "I dont\nremember seeing her afterwards.",
    "Somebody told me just now that shes\nmissing.",
    "Is that true\u201d\n\u201cYes it is.\u201d\n\u201cOh well\u201d said Sally Legge cheerfully \u201cshes a bit queer in the top\nstory you know.",
    "I dare say having a murder here has frightened her.\u201d\n\u201cWell thank you Mrs Legge.\u201d\nMrs Legge accepted the dismissal with promptitude.",
    "She went out\npassing Hercule Poirot in the doorway.",
    "Dead Mans Folly\nIII\nLooking at the ceiling the inspector spoke.",

    "He came at last to the\nFolly and going inside it he sat down on the stone bench there to rest his\nfeet which were as was his custom enclosed in tight pointed patentleather\nshoes.",
    "Through the trees he could catch faint glimmers of the river and of the\nwooded banks on the opposite side.",
    "He found himself agreeing with the\nyoung architect that this was no place to put an architectural fantasy of this\nkind.",
    "Gaps could be cut in the trees of course but even then there would be\nno proper view.",
    "Whereas as Michael Weyman had said on the grassy bank\nnear the house a Folly could have been erected with a delightful vista right\ndown the river to Helmmouth.",
    "Poirots thoughts flew off at a tangent.",
    "Helmmouth the yacht Esp\u00e9rance and Etienne De Sousa.",
    "The whole thing\nmust tie up in some kind of pattern but what the pattern was he could not\nvisualise.",
    "Tempting strands of it showed here and there but that was all.",
    "Something that glittered caught his eye and he bent to pick it up.",
    "It had\ncome to rest in a small crack of the concrete base to the temple.",
    "He held it\nin the palm of his hand and looked at it with a faint stirring of recognition.",
    "It was a little gold aeroplane charm.",
    "As he frowned at it a picture came into\nhis mind.",
    "A bracelet.",
    "A gold bracelet hung over with dangling charms.",
    "He\nwas sitting once more in the tent and the voice of Madame Zuleika alias\nSally Legge was talking of dark women and journeys across the sea and\ngood fortune in a letter.",
    "Yes she had had on a bracelet from which\ndepended a multiplicity of small gold objects.",
    "One of these modern fashions\nwhich repeated the fashions of Poirots early days.",
    "Probably that was why it\nhad made an impression on him.",
    "Some time or other presumably Mrs\nLegge had sat here in the Folly and one of the charms had fallen from her\nbracelet.",
    "Perhaps she had not even noticed it.",
    "It might have been some days\nago  weeks perhaps.",
    "Or it might have been yesterday afternoon.",
    "Poirot considered that latter point.",
    "Then he heard footsteps outside and\nlooked up sharply.",
    "A figure came round to the front of the Folly and\nstopped startled at the sight of Poirot.",
    "Poirot looked with a considering eye\non the slim fair young man wearing a shirt on which a variety of tortoise\n\n\fand turtle was depicted.",
    "The shirt was unmistakable.",
    "He had observed it\nclosely yesterday when its wearer was throwing coconuts.",
    "He noticed that the young man was almost unusually perturbed.",
    "He said\nquickly in a foreign accent\n\u201cI beg your pardon  I did not know \u201d\nPoirot smiled gently at him but with a reproving air.",
    "\u201cI am afraid\u201d he said \u201cthat you are trespassing.\u201d\n\u201cYes I am sorry.\u201d\n\u201cYou come from the hostel\u201d\n\u201cYes.",
    "Yes I do.",
    "I thought perhaps one could get through the woods this\nway and so to the quay.\u201d\n\u201cI am afraid\u201d said Poirot gently\u201c that you will have to go back the way\nyou came.",
    "There is no through road.\u201d\nThe young man said again showing all his teeth in a wouldbe\nagreeable smile\n\u201cI am sorry.",
    "I am very sorry.\u201d\nHe bowed and turned away.",
    "Poirot came out of the Folly and back on to the path watching the boy\nretreat.",
    "When he got to the ending of the path he looked over his shoulder.",
    "Then seeing Poirot watching him he quickened his pace and disappeared\nround the bend.",
    "\u201cEh bien\u201d said Poirot to himself \u201cis this a murderer I have seen or is it\nnot\u201d\nThe young man had certainly been at the f\u043ate yesterday and had\nscowled when he had collided with Poirot and just as certainly therefore he\nmust know quite well that there was no through path by way of the woods\nto the ferry.",
    "If indeed he had been looking for a path to the ferry he would\nnot have taken this path by the Folly but would have kept on the lower\nlevel near the river.",
    "Moreover he had arrived at the Folly with the air of one\nwho has reached his rendezvous and who is badly startled at finding the\nwrong person at the meeting place.",
    "\u201cSo it is like this\u201d said Poirot to himself.",
    "\u201cHe came here to meet\nsomeone.",
    "Who did he come to meet\u201d He added as an afterthought \u201cAnd\nwhy\u201d\nHe strolled down to the bend of the path and looked at it where it wound\naway into the trees.",
    "There was no sign of the young man in the turtle shirt\n\n\fnow.",
    "Presumably he had deemed it prudent to retreat as rapidly as possible.",
    "Poirot retraced his steps shaking his head.",
    "Lost in thought he came quietly round the side of the Folly and stopped\non the threshold startled in his turn.",
    "Sally Legge was there on her knees\nher head bent down to the cracks in the flooring.",
    "She jumped up startled.",
    "\u201cOh M. Poirot you gave me such a shock.",
    "I didnt hear you coming.\u201d\n\u201cYou were looking for something Madame\u201d\n\u201cI  no not exactly.\u201d\n\u201cYou had lost something perhaps\u201d said Poirot.",
    "\u201cDropped something.",
    "Or perhaps...\u201d He adopted a roguish gallant air \u201cOr perhaps Madame it is\na rendezvous.",
    "I am most unfortunately not the person you came to meet\u201d\nShe had recovered her aplomb by now.",
    "\u201cDoes one ever have rendezvous in the middle of the morning\u201d she\ndemanded questioningly.",
    "\u201cSometimes\u201d said Poirot \u201cone has to have a rendezvous at the only\ntime one can.",
    "Husbands\u201d he added sententiously \u201care sometimes jealous.\u201d\n\u201cI doubt if mine is\u201d said Sally Legge.",
    "She said the words lightly enough but behind them Poirot heard an\nundertone of bitterness.",
    "\u201cHes so completely engrossed in his own affairs.\u201d\n\u201cAll women complain of that in husbands\u201d said Poirot.",
    "\u201cEspecially in\nEnglish husbands\u201d he added.",
    "\u201cYou foreigners are more gallant.\u201d\n\u201cWe know\u201d said Poirot \u201cthat it is necessary to tell a woman at least\nonce a week and preferably three or four times that we love her and that it\nis also wise to bring her a few flowers to pay her a few compliments to tell\nher that she looks well in her new dress or her new hat.\u201d\n\u201cIs that what you do\u201d\n\u201cI Madame am not a husband\u201d said Hercule Poirot.",
    "\u201cAlas\u201d he added.",
    "\u201cIm sure theres no alas about it.",
    "Im sure youre quite delighted to be a\ncarefree bachelor.\u201d\n\u201cNo no Madame it is terrible all that I have missed in life.\u201d\n\u201cI think ones a fool to marry\u201d said Sally Legge.",
    "\u201cYou regret the days when you painted in your studio in Chelsea\u201d\n\u201cYou seem to know all about me M. Poirot\u201d\n\u201cI am a gossip\u201d said Hercule Poirot.",
    "\u201cI like to hear all about people.\u201d\nHe went on \u201cDo you really regret Madame\u201d\n\n\f\u201cOh I dont know.\u201d She sat down impatiently on the seat.",
    "Poirot sat\nbeside her.",
    "He witnessed once more the phenomena which he was becoming\naccustomed.",
    "This attractive redhaired girl was about to say things to him\nthat she would have thought twice about saying to an Englishman.",
    "\u201cI hoped\u201d she said \u201cthat when we came down here for a holiday away\nfrom everything that things would be the same again...",
    "But it hasnt worked\nout like that.\u201d\n\u201cNo\u201d\n\u201cNo.",
    "Alecs just as moody and  oh I dont know  wrapped up in\nhimself.",
    "I dont know whats the matter with him.",
    "Hes so nervy and on\nedge.",
    "People ring him up and leave queer messages for him and he wont\ntell me anything.",
    "Thats what makes me mad.",
    "He wont tell me anything I\nthought at first it was some other woman but I dont think it is.",
    "Not\nreally...\u201d\nBut her voice held a certain doubt which Poirot was quick to notice.",
    "\u201cDid you enjoy your tea yesterday afternoon Madame\u201d he asked.",
    "\u201cEnjoy my tea\u201d She frowned at him thoughts seeming to come back\nfrom a long way away.",
    "Then she said hastily \u201cOh yes.",
    "Youve no idea how\nexhausting it was sitting in that tent muffled up in all those veils.",
    "It was\nstifling.\u201d\n\u201cThe tea tent also must have been somewhat stifling\u201d\n\u201cOh yes it was.",
    "However theres nothing like a cuppa is there\u201d\n\u201cYou were searching for something just now were you not Madame\nWould it by any possibility be this\u201d He held out in his hand the little gold\ncharm.",
    "\u201cI  oh yes.",
    "Oh thank you M. Poirot.",
    "Where did you find it\u201d\n\u201cIt was here on the floor in that crack over there.\u201d\n\u201cI must have dropped it some time.\u201d\n\u201cYesterday\u201d\n\u201cOh no not yesterday.",
    "It was before that.\u201d\n\u201cBut surely Madame I remember seeing that particular charm on your\nwrist when you were telling me my fortune.\u201d\nNobody could tell a deliberate lie better than Hercule Poirot.",
    "He spoke\nwith complete assurance and before that assurance.",
    "Sally Legges eyelids\ndropped.",
    "\u201cI dont really remember\u201d she said.",
    "\u201cI only noticed this morning that it\nwas missing.\u201d\n\u201cThen I am happy\u201d said Poirot gallantly \u201cto be able to restore it to\nyou.\u201d\nShe was turning the little charm over nervously in her fingers.",
    "Now she\nrose.",
    "\u201cWell thank you M. Poirot thank you very much\u201d she said.",
    "Her breath\nwas coming rather unevenly and her eyes were nervous.",
    "She hurried out of the Folly.",
    "Poirot leaned back in the seat and nodded\nhis head slowly.",
    "No he said to himself no you did not go to the tea tent yesterday\nafternoon.",
    "It was not because you wanted your tea that you were so anxious\nto know if it was four oclock.",
    "It was here you came yesterday afternoon.",
    "Here to the Folly.",
    "Halfway to the boathouse.",
    "You came here to meet\nsomeone.",
    "Once again he heard footsteps approaching.",
    "Rapid impatient footsteps.",
    "\u201cAnd here perhaps\u201d said Poirot smiling in anticipation \u201ccomes whoever it\nwas that Mrs Legge came up here to meet.\u201d\nBut then as Alec Legge came round the corner of the Folly Poirot\nejaculated\n\u201cWrong again.\u201d\n\u201cEh Whats that\u201d Alec Legge looked startled.",
    "\u201cI said\u201d explained Poirot \u201cthat I was wrong again.",
    "I am not often\nwrong\u201d he explained \u201cand it exasperates me.",
    "It was not you I expected to\nsee.\u201d\n\u201cWhom did you expect to see\u201d asked Alec Legge.",
    "Poirot replied promptly.",
    "\u201cA young man  a boy almost  in one of these gailypatterned shirts\nwith turtles on it.\u201d\nHe was pleased at the effect of his words.",
    "Alec Legge took a step\nforward.",
    "He said rather incoherently\n\u201cHow do you know How did  what dyou mean\u201d\n\u201cI am psychic\u201d said Hercule Poirot and closed his eyes.",
    "Alec Legge took another couple of steps forward.",
    "Poirot was conscious\nthat a very angry man was standing in front of him.",
    "\u201cWhat the devil did you mean\u201d he demanded.",
    "\u201cYour friend has I think\u201d said Poirot \u201cgone back to the Youth Hostel.",
    "If you want to see him you will have to go there to find him.\u201d\n\u201cSo thats it\u201d muttered Alec Legge.",
    "He dropped down at the other end of the stone bench.",
    "\u201cSo thats why youre down here It wasnt a question of giving away\nthe prizes.",
    "I might have known better.\u201d He turned towards Poirot.",
    "His face\nwas haggard and unhappy.",
    "\u201cI know what it must seem like\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cI\nknow what the whole thing looks like.",
    "But it isnt as you think it is.",
    "Im\nbeing victimised.",
    "I tell you that once you get into these peoples clutches it\nisnt so easy to get out of them.",
    "And I want to get out of them.",
    "Thats the\npoint I want to get out of them.",
    "You get desperate you know.",
    "You feel like\ntaking desperate measures.",
    "You feel youre caught like a rat in a trap and\ntheres nothing you can do.",
    "Oh well whats the good of talking You know\nwhat you want to know now I suppose.",
    "Youve got your evidence.\u201d\nHe got up stumbled a little as though he could hardly see his way then\nrushed off energetically without a backward look.",
    "Hercule Poirot remained behind with his eyes very wide open and his\neyebrows rising.",
    "\u201cAll this is very curious\u201d he murmured.",
    "\u201cCurious and interesting.",
    "I\nhave the evidence I need have I Evidence of what Murder\u201d\n\n\fDead Mans Folly\n\n\f\fChapter 14\nInspector Bland sat in Helmmouth Police Station.",
    "Superintendent\nBaldwin a large comfortablelooking man sat on the other side of the table.",
    "Between the two men on the table was a black sodden mass.",
    "Inspector\nBland poked at it with a cautious forefinger.",
    "\u201cThats her hat all right\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cIm sure of it though I dont suppose\nI could swear to it.",
    "She fancied that shape it seems.",
    "So her maid told me.",
    "Shed got one or two of them.",
    "A pale pink and a sort of puce colour but\nyesterday she was wearing the black one.",
    "Yes this is it.",
    "And you fished it\nout of the river That makes it look as though its the way we think it is.\u201d\n\u201cNo certainty yet\u201d said Baldwin.",
    "\u201cAfter all\u201d he added \u201canyone could\nthrow a hat into the river.\u201d\n\u201cYes\u201d said Bland \u201cthey could throw it in from the boathouse or they\ncould throw it in off a yacht.\u201d\n\u201cThe yachts sewed up all right\u201d said Baldwin.",
    "\u201cIf shes there alive or\ndead shes still there.\u201d\n\u201cHe hasnt been ashore today\u201d\n\u201cNot so far.",
    "Hes on board.",
    "Hes been sitting out in a deckchair smoking\na cigar.\u201d\nInspector Bland glanced at the clock.",
    "\u201cAlmost time to go aboard\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cThink youll find her\u201d asked Baldwin.",
    "\u201cI wouldnt bank on it\u201d said Bland.",
    "\u201cIve got the feeling you know that\nhes a clever devil.\u201d He was lost in thought for a moment poking again at\nthe hat.",
    "Then he said \u201cWhat about the body  if there was a body Any\nideas about that\u201d\n\u201cYes\u201d said Baldwin \u201cI talked to Otterweight this morning.",
    "Excoastguard man.",
    "I always consult him in anything to do with tides and\ncurrents.",
    "About the time the lady went into the Helm if she did go into the\nHelm the tide was just on the ebb.",

    "Reckon shed be carried out to sea and the current would\ntake her towards the Cornish coast.",
    "Theres no certainty where the body\nwould fetch up or if it would fetch up at all.",
    "One or two drownings weve\nhad here weve never recovered the body.",
    "It gets broken up too on the\nrocks.",
    "Here by Start Point.",
    "On the other hand it might fetch up any day.\u201d\n\u201cIf it doesnt its going to be difficult\u201d said Bland.",

    "\u201cCant get anywhere until I find the body.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about the other girl\u201d\n\u201cShe saw it  or she saw something.",
    "Well get at the facts in the end but\nit wont be easy.\u201d\nBaldwin in his turn looked up at the clock.",
    "\u201cTime to go\u201d he said.",
    "The two police officers were received on board the Esp\u00e9rance with all\nDe Sousas charming courtesy.",
    "He offered them drinks which they refused\nand went on to express a kindly interest in their activities.",
    "\u201cYou are farther forward with your inquiries regarding the death of this\nyoung girl\u201d\n\u201cWere progressing\u201d Inspector Bland told him.",
    "The superintendent took up the running and expressed very delicately\nthe object of their visit.",

    "Inspector\nBland looked surreptitiously at his watch.",
    "It was just quarterpast four.",
    "They\nwere coming now close beside the Nasse boathouse.",

    "Not earlier.",
    "That leaves about an hour\nof his time unaccounted for.",
    "He says of course that Merdell has no idea of\ntime and was quite wrong as to when he saw him.",
    "And after all the old man\nis ninetytwo.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cRather unsatisfactory\u201d said Major Merrall.",
    "\u201cNo motive or anything of\nthat kind to tie him in\u201d\n\u201cHe might have been having an affair with Lady Stubbs\u201d said Bland\ndoubtfully \u201cand she might have been threatening to tell his wife and he\nmight have done her in and the girl might have seen it happen \u201d\n\u201cAnd he concealed Lady Stubbss body somewhere\u201d\n\u201cYes.",
    "But Im blessed if I know how or where.",
    "My men have searched\nthat sixtyfive acres and theres no trace anywhere of disturbed earth and I\nshould say that by now weve rooted under every bush there is.",
    "Still say he\ndid manage to hide the body he could have thrown her hat into the river as\na blind.",
    "And Marlene Tucker saw him and so he disposed of her That part\nof its always the same.\u201d Inspector Bland paused then said \u201cAnd of course\ntheres Mrs Legge \u201d\n\u201cWhat have we got on her\u201d\n\u201cShe wasnt in the tea tent from four to halfpast as she says she was\u201d\nsaid Inspector Bland slowly.",
    "\u201cI spotted that as soon as Id talked to her and\nto Mrs Folliat.",
    "Evidence supports Mrs Folliats statement.",
    "And thats the\nparticular vital halfhour.\u201d Again he paused.",
    "\u201cThen theres the architect\nyoung Michael Weyman.",
    "Its difficult to tie him up with it in any way but\nhes what I should call a likely murderer  one of those cocky nervy young\nfellows.",
    "Would kill anyone and not turn a hair about it.",
    "In with a loose set I\nshouldnt wonder.\u201d\n\u201cYoure so damned respectable Bland\u201d said Major Merrall.",
    "\u201cHow does\nhe account for his movements\u201d\n\u201cVery vague sir.",
    "Very vague indeed.\u201d\n\u201cThat proves hes a genuine architect\u201d said Major Merrall with feeling.",
    "He had recently built himself a house near the sea coast.",
    "\u201cTheyre so vague\nI wonder theyre alive at all sometimes.\u201d\n\u201cDoesnt know where he was or when and theres nobody who seems to\nhave seen him.",
    "There is some evidence that Lady Stubbs was keen on him.\u201d\n\u201cI suppose youre hinting at one of these sex murders\u201d\n\u201cIm only looking about for what I can find sir\u201d said Inspector Bland\nwith dignity.",
    "\u201cAnd then theres Miss Brewis...\u201d He paused.",
    "It was a long\npause.",
    "\u201cThats the secretary isnt it\u201d\n\u201cYes sir.",
    "Very efficient woman.\u201d\nAgain there was a pause.",
    "Major Merrall eyed his subordinate keenly.",
    "\u201cYouve got something on your mind about her havent you\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cYes I have sir.",
    "You see she admits quite openly that she was in the\nboathouse at about the time the murder must have been committed.\u201d\n\u201cWould she do that if she was guilty\u201d\n\u201cShe might\u201d said Inspector Bland slowly.",
    "\u201cActually its the best thing\nshe could do.",
    "You see if she picks up a tray with cake and a fruit drink and\ntells everyone shes taking that for the child down there  well then her\npresence is accounted for.",
    "She goes there and comes back and says the girl\nwas alive at that time.",
    "Weve taken her word for it.",
    "But if you remember sir\nand look again at the medical evidence Dr Cooks time of death is between\nfour oclock and quarter to five.",
    "Weve only Miss Brewiss word for it that\nMarlene was alive at a quarter past four.",
    "And theres one curious point that\ncame up about her testimony.",
    "She told me that it was Lady Stubbs who told\nher to take the cakes and fruit drink to Marlene.",
    "But another witness said\nquite definitely that that wasnt the sort of thing that Lady Stubbs would\nthink about.",
    "And I think you know that theyre right there.",
    "Its not like\nLady Stubbs.",
    "Lady Stubbs was a dumb beauty wrapped up in herself and\nher own appearance.",
    "She never seems to have ordered meals or taken an\ninterest in household management or thought of anybody at all except her\nown handsome self.",
    "The more I think of it the more it seems most unlikely\nthat she should have told Miss Brewis to take anything to the Girl Guide.\u201d\n\u201cYou know Bland\u201d said Merrall \u201cyouve got something there.",
    "But\nwhats her motive if so\u201d\n\u201cNo motive for killing the girl\u201d said Bland \u201cbut I do think you know\nthat she might have a motive for killing Lady Stubbs.",
    "According to M.\nPoirot whom I told you about shes head over heels in love with her\nemployer.",
    "Supposing she followed Lady Stubbs into the woods and killed\nher and that Marlene Tucker bored in the boathouse came out and\nhappened to see it Then of course shed have to kill Marlene too.",
    "What\nwould she do next Put the girls body in the boathouse come back to the\nhouse fetch the tray and go down to the boathouse again.",
    "Then shes\ncovered her own absence from the f\u043ate and weve got her testimony our\nonly reliable testimony on the face of it that Marlene Tucker was alive at a\nquarter past four.\u201d\n\u201cWell\u201d said Major Merrall with a sigh \u201ckeep after it Bland.",
    "Keep after\nit.",
    "What do you think she did with Lady Stubbss body if shes the guilty\nparty\u201d\n\n\f\u201cHid it in the woods buried it or threw it into the river.\u201d\n\u201cThe last would be rather difficult wouldnt it\u201d\n\u201cIt depends where the murder was committed\u201d said the inspector.",
    "\u201cShes quite a hefty woman.",
    "If it was not far from the boathouse she could\nhave carried her down there and thrown her off the edge of the quay.\u201d\n\u201cWith every pleasure steamer on the Helm looking on\u201d\n\u201cIt would be just another piece of horseplay.",
    "Risky but possible.",
    "But I\nthink it far more likely myself that she hid the body somewhere and just\nthrew the hat into the Helm.",
    "Its possible you see that she knowing the\nhouse and grounds well might know some place where you could conceal a\nbody.",
    "She may have managed to dispose of it in the river later.",
    "Who knows\nThat is of course if she did it\u201d added Inspector Bland as an afterthought.",
    "\u201cBut actually sir I stick to de Sousa \u201d\nMajor Merall had been noting down points on a pad.",
    "He looked up now\nclearing his throat.",
    "\u201cIt comes to this then.",
    "We can summarise it as follows weve got five\nor six people who could have killed Marlene Tucker.",
    "Some of them are\nmore likely than others but thats as far as we can go.",
    "In a general way we\nknow why she was killed.",
    "She was killed because she saw something.",
    "But\nuntil we know exactly what it was she saw  we dont know who killed her.\u201d\n\u201cPut like that you make it sound a bit difficult sir.\u201d\n\u201cOh it is difficult.",
    "But we shall get there  in the end.\u201d\n\u201cAnd meantime that chap will have left England  laughing in his sleeve\n having got away with two murders.\u201d\n\u201cYoure fairly sure about him arent you I dont say youre wrong.",
    "All\nthe same...\u201d\nThe chief constable was silent for a moment or two then he said with a\nshrug of his shoulders\n\u201cAnyway its better than having one of these psychopathic murderers.",
    "Wed probably having a third murer on our hands by now.\u201d\n\u201cThey do say things go in threes\u201d said the inspector gloomily.",
    "He repeated that remark the following morning when he heard that old\nMerdell returning home from a visit to his favourite pub across the river at\nGitcham must have exceeded his usual potations and fallen in the river\nwhen boarding the quay.",
    "His boat was found adrift and the old mans body\nwas recovered that evening.",
    "The inquest was short and simple.",
    "The night had been dark and\novercast old Merdell had had three pints of beer and after all he was\nninetytwo.",
    "The verdict brought in was Accidental Death.",
    "Dead Mans Folly\n\n\f\fChapter 16\nHercule Poirot sat in a square chair in front of the square fireplace in the\nsquare room of his London flat.",
    "In front of him were various objects that\nwere not square that were instead violently and almost impossibly curved.",
    "Each of them studied separately looked as if they could not have any\nconceivable function in a sane world.",
    "They appeared improbable\nirresponsible and wholly fortuitous.",
    "In actual fact of course they were\nnothing of the sort.",
    "Assessed correctly each had its particular place in a particular universe.",
    "Assembled in their proper place in their particular universe they not only\nmade sense they made a picture.",
    "In other words Hercule Poirot was doing\na jigsaw puzzle.",
    "He looked down at where a rectangle still showed improbably shaped\ngaps.",
    "It was an occupation he found soothing and pleasant.",
    "It brought\ndisorder into order.",
    "It had he reflected a certain resemblance to his own\nprofession.",
    "There too one was faced with various improbably shaped and\nunlikely facts which though seeming to bear no relationship to each other\nyet did each have its properly balanced part in assembling the whole.",
    "His\nfingers deftly picked up an improbable piece of dark grey and fitted it into a\nblue sky.",
    "It was he now perceived part of an aeroplane.",
    "\u201cYes\u201d murmured Poirot to himself \u201cthat is what one must do.",
    "The\nunlikely piece here the improbable piece there the ohsorational piece that\nis not what it seems all of these have their appointed place and once they\nare fitted in eh bien there is an end of the business All is clear.",
    "All is  as\nthey say nowadays  in the picture.\u201d\nHe fitted in in rapid succession a small piece of a minaret another\npiece that looked as though it was part of a striped awning and was actually\nthe backside of a cat and a missing piece of sunset that had changed with\nTurneresque suddenness from orange to pink.",
    "If one knew what to look for it would be so easy said Hercule Poirot to\nhimself.",
    "But one does not know what to look for.",
    "And so one looks in the\nwrong places or for the wrong things.",
    "He sighed vexedly.",
    "His eyes strayed\nfrom the jigsaw puzzle in front of him to the chair on the other side of the\nfireplace.",
    "There not half an hour ago Inspector Bland had sat consuming\ntea and crumpets square crumpets and talking sadly.",
    "He had had to come\nto London on police business and that police business having been\n\n\faccomplished he had come to call upon M. Poirot.",
    "He had wondered he\nexplained whether M. Poirot had any ideas.",
    "He had then proceeded to\nexplain his own ideas.",
    "On every point he outlined Poirot had agreed with\nhim.",
    "Inspector Bland so Poirot thought had made a very fair and\nunprejudiced survey of the case.",
    "It was now a month nearly five weeks since the occurrences at Nasse\nHouse.",
    "It had been five weeks of stagnation and of negation.",
    "Lady Stubbss\nbody had not been recovered.",
    "Lady Stubbs if living had not been traced.",
    "The odds Inspector Bland pointed out were strongly against her being\nalive.",
    "Poirot agreed with him.",
    "\u201cOf course\u201d said Bland \u201cthe body might not have been washed up.",
    "Theres no telling with a body once its in the water.",
    "It may show up yet\nthough it will be pretty unrecognisable when it does.\u201d\n\u201cThere is a third possibility\u201d Poirot pointed out.",
    "Bland nodded.",
    "\u201cYes\u201d he said\u201c Ive thought of that.",
    "I keep thinking of that in fact.",
    "You\nmean the bodys there  at Nasse hidden somewhere where weve never\nthought of looking.",
    "It could be you know.",
    "It just could be.",
    "With an old\nhouse and with grounds like that there are places youd never think of that youd never know were there.\u201d\nHe paused a moment ruminated and then said\n\u201cTheres a house I was in only the other day.",
    "Theyd built an airraid\nshelter you know in the war.",
    "A flimsy sort of more or less homemade job\nin the garden by the wall of the house and had made a way from it into the\nhouse  into the cellar.",
    "Well the war ended the shelter tumbled down they\nheaped it up in irregular mounds and made a kind of rockery of it.",
    "Walking\nthrough that garden now youd never think that the place had once been an\nairraid shelter and that there was a chamber underneath.",
    "Looks as though it\nwas always meant to be a rockery.",
    "And all the time behind a wine bin in\nthe cellar theres a passage leading into it.",
    "Thats what I mean.",
    "That kind of\nthing.",
    "Some sort of way into some kind of place that no outsider would\nknow about.",
    "I dont suppose theres an actual Priests Hole or anything of\nthat kind\u201d\n\u201cHardly  not at that period.\u201d\n\u201cThats what Mr Weyman says  he says the house was built about 1790\nor thereabouts.",
    "No reason for priests to hide themselves by that date.",
    "All the\nsame you know there might be  somewhere some alteration in the\n\n\fstructure  something that one of the family might know about.",
    "What do\nyou think M. Poirot\u201d\n\u201cIt is possible yes\u201d said Poirot.",
    "\u201cMais oui decidedly it is an idea.",
    "If\none accepts the possibility then the next thing is  who would know about\nit Anyone staying in the house might know I suppose\u201d\n\u201cYes.",
    "Of course it would let out De Sousa.\u201d The inspector looked\ndissatisfied.",
    "De Sousa was still his preferred suspect.",
    "\u201cAs you say anyone\nwho lived in the house such as a servant or one of the family might know\nabout it.",
    "Someone just staying in the house would be less likely.",
    "People who\nonly came in from outside like the Legges less likely still.\u201d\n\u201cThe person who would certainly know about such a thing and who\ncould tell you if you asked her would be Mrs Folliat\u201d said Poirot.",
    "Mrs Folliat he thought knew all there was to know about Nasse House.",
    "Mrs Folliat knew a great deal... Mrs Folliat had known straight away that\nHattie Stubbs was dead.",
    "Mrs Folliat knew before Marlene and hattie stubbs\ndied that it was a very wicked world and that there were very wicked\npeople in it.",
    "Mrs Folliat thought Poirot vexedly was the key to the whole\nbusiness.",
    "But Mrs Folliat he reflected was a key that would not easily turn\nin the lock.",
    "\u201cIve interviewed the lady several times\u201d said the inspector.",
    "\u201cVery nice\nvery pleasant shes been about everything and seems very distressed that\nshe cant suggest anything helpful.\u201d\nCant or wont thought Poirot.",
    "Bland was perhaps thinking the same.",
    "\u201cTheres a type of lady\u201d he said \u201cthat you cant force.",
    "You cant frighten\nthem or persuade them or diddle them.\u201d\nNo Poirot thought you couldnt force or persuade or diddle Mrs Folliat.",
    "The inspector had finished his tea and sighed and gone and Poirot had\ngot out his jigsaw puzzle to alleviate his mounting exasperation.",
    "For he was\nexasperated.",
    "Both exasperated and humiliated.",
    "Mrs Oliver had summoned\nhim Hercule Poirot to elucidate a mystery.",
    "She had felt that there was\nsomething wrong and there had been something wrong.",
    "And she had\nlooked confidently to Hercule Poirot first to prevent it  and he had not\nprevented it  and secondly to discover the killer and he had not\ndiscovered the killer.",
    "He was in a fog in the type of fog where there is from\ntime to time baffling gleams of light.",
    "Every now and then or so it seemed\nto him he had had one of those glimpses.",
    "And each time he had failed to\n\n\fpenetrate farther.",
    "He had failed to assess the value of what he seemed for\none brief moment to have seen.",
    "Poirot got up crossed to the other side of the hearth rearranged the\nsecond square chair so that it was at a definite geometric angle and sat\ndown in it.",
    "He had passed from the jigsaw of painted wood and cardboard\nto the jigsaw of a murder problem.",
    "He took a notebook from his pocket and\nwrote in small neat characters\n\u201cEtienne De Sousa Amanda Brewis Alec Legge Sally Legge Michael\nWeyman.\u201d\nIt was physically impossible for Sir George or Jim Warburton to have\nkilled Marlene Tucker.",
    "Since it was not physically impossible for Mrs\nOliver to have done so he added her name after a brief space.",
    "He also\nadded the name of Mrs Masterton since he did not remember of his own\nknowledge having seen Mrs Masterton constantly on the lawn between four\noclock and quarter to five.",
    "He added the name of Henden the butler more\nperhaps because a sinister butler had figured in Mrs Olivers Murder Hunt\nthan because he had really any suspicions of the darkhaired artist with the\ngong stick.",
    "He also put down \u201cBoy in turtle shirt\u201d with a query mark after\nit.",
    "Then he smiled shook his head took a pin from the lapel of his jacket\nshut his eyes and stabbed with it.",
    "It was as good a way as any other he\nthought.",
    "He was justifiably annoyed when the pin proved to have transfixed the\nlast entry.",
    "\u201cI am an imbecile\u201d said Hercule Poirot.",
    "\u201cWhat has a boy in a turtle\nshirt to do with this\u201d\nBut he also realised he must have had some reason for including this\nenigmatic character in his list.",
    "He recalled again the day he had sat in the\nFolly and the surprise on the boys face at seeing him there.",
    "Not a very\npleasant face despite the youthful good looks.",
    "An arrogant ruthless face.",
    "The young man had come there for some purpose.",
    "He had come to meet\nsomeone and it followed that that someone was a person whom he could\nnot meet or did not wish to meet in the ordinary way.",
    "It was a meeting in\nfact to which attention must not be called.",
    "A guilty meeting.",
    "Something to\ndo with the murder\nPoirot pursued his reflections.",
    "A boy who was staying at the Youth\nHostel  that is to say a boy who would be in that neighbourhood for two\nnights at most.",
    "Had he come there casually One of the many young\n\n\fstudents visiting Britain Or had he come there for a special purpose to\nmeet some special person There could have been what seemed a casual\nencounter on the day of the f\u043ate  possibly there had been.",
    "I know a good deal said Hercule Poirot to himself.",
    "I have in my hands\nmany many pieces of this jigsaw.",
    "I have an idea of the kind of crime this\nwas  but it must be that I am not looking at it the right way.",
    "He turned a page of his notebook and wrote Did Lady Stubbs ask Miss\nBrewis to take tea to Marlene If not why does Miss Brewis say that she\ndid\nHe considered the point.",
    "Miss Brewis might quite easily herself have\nthought of taking cake and a fruit drink to the girl.",
    "But if so why did she not\nsimply say so Why lie about Lady Stubbs having asked her to do so\nCould this be because Miss Brewis went to the boathouse and found\nMarlene dead Unless Miss Brewis was herself guilty of the murder that\nseemed very unlikely.",
    "She was not a nervous woman nor an imaginative\none.",
    "If she had found the girl dead she would surely at once have given the\nalarm\nHe stared for some time at the two questions he had written.",
    "He could\nnot help feeling that somewhere in those words there was some vital pointer\nto the truth that had escaped him.",
    "After four or five minutes of thought he\nwrote down something more.",
    "Etienne De Sousa declares that he wrote to his cousin three weeks\nbefore his arrival at Nasse House.",
    "Is that statement true or false\nPoirot felt almost certain that it was false.",
    "He recalled the scene at the\nbreakfast table.",
    "There seemed no earthly reason why Sir George or Lady\nStubbs should pretend to a surprise and in the latters case a dismay which\nthey did not feel.",
    "He could see no purpose to be accomplished by it.",
    "Granting however that Etienne De Sousa had lied why did he lie To give\nthe impression that his visit had been announced and welcomed It might\nbe so but it seemed a very doubtful reason.",
    "There was certainly no\nevidence that such a letter had ever been written or received.",
    "Was it an\nattempt on De Sousas part to establish his bona fides  to make his visit\nappear natural and even expected Certainly Sir George had received him\namicably enough although he did not know him.",
    "Poirot paused his thoughts coming to a stop.",
    "Sir George did not know\nDe Sousa.",
    "His wife who did know him had not seen him.",
    "Was there\nperhaps something there Could it be possible that the Etienne De Sousa\n\n\fwho had arrived that day at the f\u043ate was not the real Etienne De Sousa He\nwent over the idea in his mind but again he could see no point to it.",
    "What\nhad De Sousa to gain by coming and representing himself as De Sousa if he\nwas not De Sousa In any case De Sousa did not derive any benefit from\nHatties death.",
    "Hattie as the police had ascertained had no money of her\nown except that which was allowed her by her husband.",
    "Poirot tried to remember exactly what she had said to him that morning.",
    "\u201cHe is a bad man.",
    "He does wicked things.\u201d And according to Bland she\nhad said to her husband \u201cHe kills people.\u201d\nThere was something rather significant about that now that one came to\nexamine all the facts.",
    "He kills people.",
    "On the day Etienne De Sousa had come to Nasse House one person\ncertainly had been killed possibly two people.",
    "Mrs Folliat had said that one\nshould pay no attention to these melodramatic remarks of Hatties.",
    "She had\nsaid so very insistently.",
    "Mrs Folliat...\nHercule Poirot frowned then brought his hand down with a bang on the\narm of his chair.",
    "\u201cAlways always  I return to Mrs Folliat.",
    "She is the key to the whole\nbusiness.",
    "If I knew what she knows...",
    "I can no longer sit in an armchair and\njust think.",
    "No I must take a train and go again to Devon and visit Mrs\nFolliat.\u201d\n\n\fDead Mans Folly\nII\nHercule Poirot paused for a moment outside the big wroughtiron gates\nof Nasse House.",
    "He looked ahead of him along the curving drive.",
    "It was no\nlonger summer.",
    "Goldenbrown leaves fluttered gently down from the trees.",
    "Near at hand the grassy banks were coloured with small mauve cyclamen.",
    "Poirot sighed.",
    "The beauty of Nasse House appealed to him in spite of\nhimself.",
    "He was not a great admirer of nature in the wild he liked things\ntrim and neat yet he could not but appreciate the soft wild beauty of massed\nshrubs and trees.",
    "At his left was the small white porticoed lodge.",
    "It was a fine afternoon.",
    "Probably Mrs Folliat would not be at home.",
    "She would be out somewhere\nwith her gardening basket or else visiting some friends in the\nneighbourhood.",
    "She had many friends.",
    "This was her home and had been\nher home for many long years.",
    "What was it the old man on the quay had\nsaid \u201cTherell always be Folliats at Nasse House.\u201d\nPoirot rapped gently upon the door of the Lodge.",
    "After a few moments\ndelay he heard footsteps inside.",
    "They sounded to his ear slow and almost\nhesitant.",
    "Then the door was opened and Mrs Folliat stood framed in the\ndoorway.",
    "He was startled to see how old and frail she looked.",
    "She stared at\nhim incredulously for a moment or two then she said\n\u201cM.",
    "Poirot You\u201d\nHe thought for a moment that he had seen fear leap into her eyes but\nperhaps that was sheer imagination on his part.",
    "He said politely\n\u201cMay I come in Madame\u201d\n\u201cBut of course.\u201d\nShe had recovered all her poise now beckoned him in with a gesture\nand led the way into her small sittingroom.",
    "There were some delicate\nChelsea figures on the mantelpiece a couple of chairs covered in exquisite\npetit point and a Derby tea service stood on the small table.",
    "Mrs Folliat\nsaid\n\u201cI will fetch another cup.\u201d\n\n\fPoirot raised a faintly protesting hand but she pushed the protest aside.",
    "\u201cOf course you must have some tea.\u201d\nShe went out of the room.",
    "He looked round him once more.",
    "A piece of\nneedlework a petit point chair seat lay on a table with a needle sticking in\nit.",
    "Against the wall was a bookcase with books.",
    "There was a little cluster of\nminiatures on the wall and a faded photograph in a silver frame of a man in\nuniform with a stiff moustache and a weak chin.",
    "Mrs Folliat came back into the room with a cup and saucer in her hand.",
    "Poirot said \u201cYour husband Madame\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\nNoticing that Poirots eyes swept along the top of the bookcase as\nthough in search of further photographs she said brusquely\n\u201cIm not fond of photographs.",
    "They make one live in the past too much.",
    "One must learn to forget.",
    "One must cut away the dead wood.\u201d\nPoirot remembered how the first time he had seen Mrs Folliat she had\nbeen clipping with secateurs at a shrub on the bank.",
    "She had said then he\nremembered something about dead wood.",
    "He looked at her thoughtfully\nappraising her character.",
    "An enigmatical woman he thought and a woman\nwho in spite of the gentleness and fragility of her appearance had a side to\nher that could be ruthless.",
    "A woman who could cut away dead wood not\nonly from plants but from her own life...\nShe sat down and poured out a cup of tea asking\n\u201cMilk Sugar\u201d\n\u201cThree lumps if you will be so good Madame\u201d\nShe handed him his cup and said conversationally\n\u201cI was surprised to see you.",
    "Somehow I did not imagine you would be\npassing through this part of the world again.\u201d\n\u201cI am not exactly passing through\u201d said Poirot.",
    "\u201cNo\u201d She queried him with slightly uplifted eyebrows.",
    "\u201cMy visit to this part of the world is intentional.\u201d\nShe still looked at him in inquiry.",
    "\u201cI came here partly to see you Madame.\u201d\n\u201cReally\u201d\n\u201cFirst of all  there has been no news of the young Lady Stubbs\u201d\nMrs Folliat shook her head.",
    "\u201cThere was a body washed up the other day in Cornwall\u201d she said.",
    "\u201cGeorge went there to see if he could identify it.",
    "But it was not her.\u201d She\n\n\fadded \u201cI am very sorry for George.",
    "The strain has been very great.\u201d\n\u201cDoes he still believe that his wife may be alive\u201d\nSlowly Mrs Folliat shook her head.",
    "\u201cI think\u201d she said \u201cthat he has given up hope.",
    "After all if Hattie were\nalive she couldnt possibly conceal herself successfully with the whole of\nthe Press and the Police looking for her.",
    "Even if something like loss of\nmemory had happened to her  well surely the police would have found her\nby now\u201d\n\u201cIt would seem so yes\u201d said Poirot.",
    "\u201cDo the police still search\u201d\n\u201cI suppose so.",
    "I do not really know.\u201d\n\u201cBut Sir George has given up hope.\u201d\n\u201cHe does not say so\u201d said Mrs Folliat.",
    "\u201cOf course I have not seen him\nlately.",
    "He has been mostly in London.\u201d\n\u201cAnd the murdered girl There have been no developments there\u201d\n\u201cNot that I know of.\u201d She added \u201cIt seems a senseless crime absolutely pointless.",
    "Poor child \u201d\n\u201cIt still upsets you I see to think of her Madame.\u201d\nMrs Folliat did not reply for a moment or two.",
    "Then she said\n\u201cI think when one is old the death of anyone who is young upsets one\nout of due proportion.",
    "We old folks expect to die but that child had her life\nbefore her.\u201d\n\u201cIt might not have been a very interesting life.\u201d\n\u201cNot from our point of view perhaps but it might have been interesting\nto her.\u201d\n\u201cAnd although as you say we old folk must expect to die\u201d said Poirot\n\u201cwe do not really want to.",
    "At least I do not want to.",
    "I find life very\ninteresting still.\u201d\n\u201cI dont think that I do.\u201d\nShe spoke more to herself than him her shoulders drooped still more.",
    "\u201cI am very tired M. Poirot.",
    "I shall be not only ready but thankful when\nmy time comes.\u201d\nHe shot a quick glance at her.",
    "He wondered as he had wondered before\nwhether it was a sick woman who sat talking to him a woman who had\nperhaps the knowledge or even the certainty of approaching death.",
    "He could\nnot otherwise account for the intense weariness and lassitude of her manner.",
    "That lassitude he felt was not really characteristic of the woman.",
    "Amy\nFolliat he felt was a woman of character energy and determination.",
    "She\n\n\fhad lived through many troubles loss of her home loss of wealth the\ndeaths of her sons.",
    "All these he felt she had survived.",
    "She had cut away the\n\u201cdead wood\u201d as she herself had expressed it.",
    "But there was something now\nin her life that she could not cut away that no one could cut away for her.",
    "If\nit was not physical illness he did not see what it could be.",
    "She gave a\nsudden little smile as though she were reading his thoughts.",
    "\u201cReally you know I have not very much to live for M. Poirot\u201d she\nsaid.",
    "\u201cI have many friends but no near relations no family.\u201d\n\u201cYou have your home\u201d said Poirot on an impulse.",
    "\u201cYou mean Nasse Yes \u201d\n\u201cIt is your home isnt it.",
    "although technically it is the property of Sir\nGeorge Stubbs Now Sir George Stubbs has gone to London you rule in his\nstead.\u201d\nAgain he saw the sharp look of fear in her eyes When she spoke her\nvoice held an icy edge to it.",
    "\u201cI dont quite know what you mean M. Poirot.",
    "I am grateful to Sir\nGeorge for renting me this lodge but I do rent it.",
    "I pay him a yearly sum for\nit with the right to walk in the grounds.\u201d\nPoirot spread out his hands.",
    "\u201cI apologise Madame.",
    "I did not mean to offend you.\u201d\n\u201cNo doubt I misunderstood you\u201d said Mrs Folliat coldly.",
    "\u201cIt is a beautiful place\u201d said Poirot.",
    "\u201cA beautiful house beautiful\ngrounds.",
    "It has about it a great peace great serenity.\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d Her face lightened.",
    "\u201cWe have always felt that.",
    "I felt it as a child\nwhen I first came here.\u201d\n\u201cBut is there the same peace and serenity now Madame\u201d\n\u201cWhy not\u201d\n\u201cMurder unavenged\u201d said Poirot.",
    "\u201cThe spilling of innocent blood.",
    "Until\nthat shadow lifts there will not be peace.\u201d He added\u201c I think you know\nthat Madame as well as I do.\u201d\nMrs Folliat did not answer.",
    "She neither moved nor spoke.",
    "She sat quite\nstill and Poirot had no idea what she was thinking.",
    "He leaned forward a\nlittle and spoke again.",
    "\u201cMadame you know a good deal  perhaps everything  about this\nmurder.",
    "You know who killed that girl you know why.",
    "You know who\nkilled Hattie Stubbs you know perhaps where her body lies now.\u201d\nMrs Folliat spoke then.",
    "Her voice was loud almost harsh.",
    "\u201cI know nothing\u201d she said.",
    "\u201cNothing.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps I have used the wrong word.",
    "You do not know but I think you\nguess Madame.",
    "Im quite sure that you guess.\u201d\n\u201cNow you are being  excuse me  absurd\u201d\n\u201cIt is not absurd  it is something quite different  it is dangerous\u201d\n\u201cDangerous To whom\u201d\n\u201cTo you Madame.",
    "So long as you keep your knowledge to yourself you\nare in danger.",
    "I know murderers better than you do Madame.\u201d\n\u201cI have told you already I have no knowledge.\u201d\n\u201cSuspicions then \u201d\n\u201cI have no suspicions.\u201d\n\u201cThat excuse me is not true Madame.\u201d\n\u201cTo speak out of mere suspicion would be wrong  indeed wicked.\u201d\nPoirot leaned forward.",
    "\u201cAs wicked as what was done here just over a\nmonth ago\u201d\nShe shrank back into her chair huddled into herself.",
    "She half whispered\n\u201cDont talk to me of it.\u201d And then added with a long shuddering sigh.",
    "\u201cAnyway its over now.",
    "Done  finished with.\u201d\n\u201cHow can you tell that Madame I tell you of my own knowledge that\nit is never finished with a murderer.\u201d\nShe shook her head.",
    "\u201cNo.",
    "No its the end.",
    "And anyway there is nothing I can do.",
    "Nothing.\u201d\nHe got up and stood looking down at her.",
    "She said almost fretfully\n\u201cWhy even the police have given up.\u201d\nPoirot shook his head.",
    "\u201cOh no Madame you are wrong there.",
    "The police do not give up.",
    "And\nI\u201d he added \u201cdo not give up either.",
    "Remember that Madame.",
    "I Hercule\nPoirot do not give up.\u201d\nIt was a very typical exit line.",
    "Dead Mans Folly\n\n\f\fChapter 17\nAfter leaving Nasse Poirot went to the village where by inquiry he\nfound the cottage occupied by the Tuckers.",
    "His knock at the door went\nunanswered for some moments as it was drowned by the highpitched\ntones of Mrs Tuckers voice from inside\n\u201c And what be yu thinking of Jim Tucker bringing them boots of\nyours on to my nice linoleum If Ive tell ee once Ive tell ee a thousand\ntimes.",
    "Been polishing it all the morning I have and now look at it.\u201d\nA faint rumbling denoted Mr Tuckers reaction to these remarks.",
    "It was\non the whole a placatory rumble.",
    "\u201cYuve no cause to go forgetting.",
    "Tis all this eagerness to get the sports\nnews on the wireless.",
    "Why it wouldnt have took ee to minutes to be off\nwith them boots.",
    "And yu Gary do ee mind what yum doing with that\nlollipop.",
    "Sticky fingers I will not have on my best silver teapot.",
    "Marilyn\nthat be someone at the door that be.",
    "Du ee go and see who tis.\u201d\nThe door was opened gingerly and a child of about eleven or twelve\nyears old peered out suspiciously at Poirot.",
    "One cheek was bulged with a\nsweet.",
    "She was a fat child with small blue eyes and a rather piggy kind of\nprettiness.",
    "\u201cTis a gentleman mum\u201d she shouted.",
    "Mrs Tucker wisps of hair hanging over her somewhat hot face came to\nthe door.",
    "\u201cWhat is it\u201d she demanded sharply.",
    "\u201cWe dont need...\u201d She paused a\nfaint look of recognition came across her face.",
    "\u201cWhy let me see now didnt\nI see you with the police that day\u201d\n\u201cAlas Madame that I have brought back painful memories\u201d said\nPoirot stepping firmly inside the door.",
    "Mrs Tucker cast a swift agonised\nglance at his feet but Poirots pointed patent leather shoes had only trodden\nthe high road.",
    "No mud was being deposited on Mrs Tuckers brightly\npolished linoleum.",
    "\u201cCome in wont you sir\u201d she said backing before him and throwing\nopen the door of a room on her right hand.",
    "Poirot was ushered into a devastatingly neat little parlour.",
    "It smelt of\nfurniture polish and Brasso and contained a large Jacobean suite a round\ntable two potted geraniums an elaborate brass fender and a large variety of\nchina ornaments.",
    "\u201cSit down sir do.",
    "I cant remember the name.",
    "Indeed I dont think as I\never heard it.\u201d\n\u201cMy name is Hercule Poirot\u201d said Poirot rapidly.",

    "I trust the murderer of\nyour daughter has been discovered\u201d\n\u201cNot sight or sound of him\u201d said Mrs Tucker speaking with some\nbitterness.",
    "\u201cAnd tis a downright wicked shame if you ask me.",
    "Tis my\nopinion the police dont disturb themselves when its only the likes of us.",
    "Whats the police anyway If theym all like Bob Hoskins I wonder the\nwhole country isnt a mass of crime.",
    "All that Bob Hoskins does is spend his\ntime looking into parked cars on the Common.\u201d\nAt this point Mr Tucker his boots removed appeared through the\ndoorway walking on his stockinged feet.",
    "He was a large redfaced man\nwith a pacific expression.",
    "\u201cPolice be all right\u201d he said in a husky voice.",
    "\u201cGot their troubles just\nlike anyone else.",

    "She did not even know Marlene.\u201d\n\u201cTwas Mrs Masterton what rounded the girls up\u201d said Mrs Tucker\n\u201cand I suppose twas Mrs Masterton said Marlene was to do it.",
    "And\nMarlene I must say was pleased enough at the idea.\u201d\nOnce again Poirot felt he came up against a blank wall.",
    "But he knew\nnow what Mrs Oliver had felt when she first sent for him.",
    "Someone had\nbeen working in the dark someone who had pushed forward their own\ndesires through other recognised personalities.",

    "\u201cAh\u201d said Poirot \u201cbut as your husband has just observed these\nmaniacs are very difficult to spot.",

    "Made\nfriends with her in a perfectly harmless manner.",
    "Given her presents\nperhaps.\u201d\n\u201cOh no sir nothing of that kind.",
    "Marlene wouldnt take presents from a\nstranger.",
    "I brought her up better than that.\u201d\n\u201cBut she might see no harm in it\u201d said Poirot persisting.",
    "\u201cSupposing it\nhad been some nice lady who had offered her things.\u201d\n\u201cSomeone you mean like young Mrs Legge down to the Mill Cottage.\u201d\n\u201cYes\u201d said Poirot.",

    "\u201cEver so mad\nI was.",

    "Think what your father would say.",
    "Well she says perky as may be tis the\nlady down at Lawders Cottage as give it me.",
    "Said as how it would suit me\nshe did.",
    "Well I said dont you listen to what no London ladies say.",
    "Tis all\nvery well for them painting their faces and blacking their eyelashes and\neverything else.",
    "But youre a decent girl I said and you wash your face\nwith soap and water until youre a good deal older than what you are now.\u201d\n\u201cBut she did not agree with you I expect\u201d said Poirot smiling.",

    "\u201cId have made\nthe most awful fool of myself.",
    "I mean what can you say about how you\nwrite books What I mean is first youve got to think of something and\nwhen youve thought of it youve got to force yourself to sit down and write\nit.",
    "Thats all.",
    "It would have taken me just three minutes to explain that and\nthen the Talk would have been ended and everyone would have been very\nfed up.",
    "I cant imagine why everybody is always so keen for authors to talk\nabout writing.",

    "I beg your pardon M. Poirot did you say\nsomething\u201d\n\n\f\u201cIt was an ejaculation only.",

    "Im never quite sure what they actually do.\u201d\n\u201cYet you made an atom scientist one of the suspects in your Murder\nHunt\u201d\n\u201cOh that That was just to be up to date.",
    "I mean when I went to buy\npresents for my nephews last Christmas there was nothing but science\nfiction and the stratosphere and supersonic toys and so I thought when I\nstarted on the Murder Hunt Better have an atom scientist as the chief\nsuspect and be modern.",

    "\u201cWho hired you to sleuth me\u201d he demanded.",
    "\u201cWas it Sally\u201d\n\u201cWhy should you think that\u201d\n\u201cWell nothings happened officially.",
    "So I concluded that you must have\ncome down after me on a private job.\u201d\n\u201cYou are in error\u201d replied Poirot.",
    "\u201cI have not at any time been sleuthing\nyou.",
    "When I came down here I had no idea that you existed.\u201d\n\u201cThen how do you know whether Ive been unfortunate or made a fool\nof myself or what\u201d\n\u201cFrom the result of observation and reflection\u201d said Poirot.",
    "\u201cShall I\nmake a little guess and will you tell me if I am right\u201d\n\u201cYou can make as many little guesses as you like\u201d said Alec Legge.",
    "\u201cBut dont expect me to play.\u201d\n\u201cI think\u201d said Poirot \u201cthat some years ago you had an interest and\nsympathy for a certain political party.",
    "Like many other young men of a\nscientific bent.",
    "In your profession such sympathies and tendencies are\nnaturally regarded with suspicion.",
    "I do not think you were ever seriously\ncompromised but I do think that pressure was brought upon you to\nconsolidate your position in a way you did not want to consolidate it.",
    "You\ntried to withdraw and you were faced with a threat.",
    "You were given a\nrendezvous with someone.",
    "I doubt if I shall ever know that young mans\nname.",
    "He will be for me always the young man in the turtle shirt.\u201d\nAlec Legge gave a sudden explosion of laughter.",
    "\u201cI suppose that shirt was a bit of a joke.",
    "I wasnt seeing things were\nfunny at the time.\u201d\nHercule Poirot continued.",
    "\u201cWhat with worry over the fate of the world and the worry over your\nown predicament you became if I may say so a man almost impossible for\nany woman to live with happily.",
    "You did not confide in your wife.",
    "That was\nunfortunate for you as I should say that your wife was a woman of loyalty\nand that if she had realised how unhappy and desperate you were she\nwould have been wholeheartedly on your side.",
    "Instead of that she merely\n\n\fbegan to compare you unfavourably with a former friend of hers Michael\nWeyman.\u201d\nHe rose.",
    "\u201cI should advise you Mr Legge to complete your packing as soon as\npossible to follow your wife to London to ask her to forgive you and to tell\nher all that you have been through.\u201d\n\u201cSo thats what you advise\u201d said Alec Legge.",
    "\u201cAnd what the hell\nbusiness is it of yours\u201d\n\u201cNone\u201d said Hercule Poirot.",
    "He withdrew towards the door.",
    "\u201cBut I am\nalways right.\u201d\nThere was a moments silence.",
    "Then Alec Legge burst into a wild peal\nof laughter.",
    "\u201cDo you know\u201d he said \u201cI think Ill take your advice Divorce is\ndamned expensive.",
    "Anyway if youve got hold of the woman you want and\nare then not able to keep her its a bit humiliating dont you think I shall\ngo up to her flat in Chelsea and if I find Michael there I shall take hold of\nhim by that handknitted pansy tie he wears and throttle the life out of him.",
    "Id enjoy that.",
    "Yes Id enjoy it a good deal.\u201d\nHis face suddenly lit up with a most attractive smile.",
    "\u201cSorry for my filthy temper\u201d he said \u201cand thanks a lot.\u201d\nHe clapped Poirot on the shoulder.",
    "With the force of the blow Poirot\nstaggered and all but fell.",
    "Mr Legges friendship was certainly more painful than his animosity.",
    "\u201cAnd now\u201d said Poirot leaving Mill Cottage on painful feet and\nlooking up at the darkening sky \u201cwhere do I go\u201d\n\n\fDead Mans Folly\n\n\f\fChapter 19\nThe chief constable and Inspector Bland looked up with keen curiosity\nas Hercule Poirot was ushered in.",
    "The chief constable was not in the best of\ntempers.",
    "Only Blands quiet persistence had caused him to cancel his dinner\nappointment for that evening.",
    "\u201cI know Bland I know\u201d he said fretfully.",
    "\u201cMaybe he was a little\nBelgian wizard in his day  but surely man his days over.",
    "Hes what age\u201d\nBland slid tactfully over the answer to this question which in any case\nhe did not know.",
    "Poirot himself was always reticent on the subject of his\nage.",
    "\u201cThe point is sir he was there  on the spot.",
    "And were not getting\nanywhere any other way.",
    "Up against a blank wall thats where we are.\u201d\nThe chief constable blew his nose irritably.",
    "\u201cI know.",
    "I know.",
    "Makes me begin to believe in Mrs Mastertons\nhomicidal pervert.",
    "Id even use bloodhounds if there were anywhere to use\nthem.\u201d\n\u201cBloodhounds cant follow a scent over water.\u201d\n\u201cYes.",
    "I know what youve always thought Bland.",
    "And Im inclined to\nagree with you.",
    "But theres absolutely no motive you know.",
    "Not an iota of\nmotive.\u201d\n\u201cThe motive may be out in the islands.\u201d\n\u201cMeaning that Hattie Stubbs knew something about De Sousa out there\nI suppose thats reasonably possible given her mentality.",
    "She was simple\neveryone agrees on that.",
    "She might blurt out what she knew to anyone at\nany time.",
    "Is that the way you see it\u201d\n\u201cSomething like that.\u201d\n\u201cIf so he waited a long time before crossing the sea and doing\nsomething about it.\u201d\n\u201cWell sir its possible he didnt know what exactly had become of her.",
    "His own story was that hed seen a piece in some society periodical about\nNasse House and its beautiful ch\u0432telaine.",
    "Which I have always thought\nmyself\u201d added Bland parenthetically \u201cto be a silver thing with chains and\nbits and pieces hung on it that peoples grandmothers used to clip on their\nwaistbands  and a good idea too.",
    "Wouldnt be all these silly women for\never leaving their handbags around.",
    "Seems though that in womens jargon\nch\u0432telaine means mistress of a house.",
    "As I say thats his story and maybe\n\n\fits true enough and he didnt know where she was or who shed married\nuntil then.\u201d\n\u201cBut once he did know he came across posthaste in a yacht in order to\nmurder her Its farfetched Bland very farfetched.\u201d\n\u201cBut it could be sir.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what on earth could the woman know\u201d\n\u201cRemember what she said to her husband.",
    "He kills people.\u201d\n\u201cMurder remembered From the time she was fifteen And presumably\nonly her word for it Surely hed be able to laugh that off\u201d\n\u201cWe dont know the facts\u201d said Bland stubbornly.",
    "\u201cYou know yourself\nsir how once one knows who did a thing one can look for the evidence and\nfind it.\u201d\n\u201cHm.",
    "Weve made inquiries about De Sousa  discreetly  through the\nusual channels  and got nowhere.\u201d\n\u201cThats just why sir this funny old Belgian boy might have stumbled on\nsomething.",
    "He was in the house  thats the important thing.",
    "Lady Stubbs\ntalked to him.",
    "Some of the random things she said may have come together\nin his mind and made sense.",
    "However that may be hes been down in\nNassecombe most of today.\u201d\n\u201cAnd he rang you up to ask what kind of a yacht Etienne De Sousa\nhad\u201d\n\u201cWhen he rang up the first time yes.",
    "The second time was to ask me to\narrange this meeting.\u201d\n\u201cWell\u201d the chief constable looked at his watch \u201cif he doesnt come\nwithin five minutes...\u201d\nBut it was at that very moment that Hercule Poirot was shown in.",
    "His appearance was not as immaculate as usual.",
    "His moustache was\nlimp affected by the damp Devon air his patentleather shoes were heavily\ncoated with mud he limped and his hair was ruffled.",
    "\u201cWell so here you are M. Poirot.\u201d The chief constable shook hands.",
    "\u201cWere all keyed up on our toes waiting to hear what you have to tell us.\u201d\nThe words were faintly ironic but Hercule Poirot however damp\nphysically was in no mood to be damped mentally.",
    "\u201cI cannot imagine\u201d he said \u201chow it was I did not see the truth before.\u201d\nThe chief constable received this rather coldly.",
    "\u201cAre we to understand that you do see the truth now\u201d\n\u201cYes there are details  but the outline is clear.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cWe want more than an outline\u201d said the chief constable dryly.",
    "\u201cWe\nwant evidence.",
    "Have you got evidence M. Poirot\u201d\n\u201cI can tell you where to find the evidence.\u201d\nInspector Bland spoke.",
    "\u201cSuch as\u201d\nPoirot turned to him and asked a question.",
    "\u201cEtienne De Sousa has I suppose left the country.\u201d\n\u201cTwo weeks ago.\u201d Bland added bitterly \u201cIt wont be easy to get him\nback.\u201d\n\u201cHe might be persuaded.\u201d\n\u201cPersuaded Theres not sufficient evidence to warrant an extradition\norder then\u201d\n\u201cIt is not a question of an extradition order.",
    "If the facts are put to him \u201d\n\u201cBut what facts M. Poirot\u201d The chief constable spoke with some\nirritation.",
    "\u201cWhat are these facts you talk about so glibly\u201d\n\u201cThe fact that Etienne De Sousa came here in a lavishly appointed\nluxury yacht showing that his family is rich the fact that old Merdell was\nMarlene Tuckers grandfather which I did not know until today the fact\nthat Lady Stubbs was fond of wearing the coolie type of hat the fact that\nMrs Oliver in spite of an unbridled and unreliable imagination is\nunrealised by herself a very shrewd judge of character the fact that\nMarlene Tucker had lipsticks and bottles of perfume hidden at the back of\nher bureau drawer the fact that Miss Brewis maintains that it was Lady\nStubbs who asked her to take a refreshment tray down to Marlene at the\nboathouse.\u201d\n\u201cFacts\u201d The chief constable stared.",
    "\u201cYou call those facts But theres\nnothing new there.\u201d\n\u201cYou prefer evidence  definite evidence  such as  Lady Stubbss\nbody\u201d\nNow it was Bland who stared.",
    "\u201cYou have found Lady Stubbss body\u201d\n\u201cNot actually found it  but I know where it is hidden.",
    "You shall go to\nthe spot and when you have found it then  then you will have evidence all the evidence you need.",
    "For only one person could have hidden it there.\u201d\n\u201cAnd whos that\u201d\nHercule Poirot smiled  the contented smile of a cat who has lapped up a\nsaucer of cream.",
    "\u201cThe person it so often is\u201d he said softly \u201cthe husband.",
    "Sir George\nStubbs killed his wife.\u201d\n\u201cBut thats impossible M. Poirot.",
    "We know its impossible.\u201d\n\u201cOh no\u201d said Poirot \u201cit is not impossible at all Listen and I will tell\nyou.\u201d\n\n\fDead Mans Folly\n\n\f\fChapter 20\nHercule Poirot paused a moment at the big wroughtiron gates.",
    "He\nlooked ahead of him along the curving drive.",
    "The last of the golden brown\nleaves fluttered down from the trees.",
    "The cyclamen were over.",
    "Poirot sighed.",
    "He turned aside and rapped gently on the door of the little\nwhite pilastered lodge.",
    "After a few moments delay he heard footsteps inside those slow\nhesitant footsteps.",
    "The door was opened by Mrs Folliat.",
    "He was not startled\nthis time to see how old and frail she looked.",
    "She said \u201cM.",
    "Poirot You again\u201d\n\u201cMay I come in\u201d\n\u201cOf course.\u201d\nHe followed her in.",
    "She offered him tea which he refused.",
    "Then she asked in a quiet voice\n\u201cWhy have you come\u201d\n\u201cI think you can guess Madame.\u201d\nHer answer was oblique.",
    "\u201cI am very tired\u201d she said.",
    "\u201cI know.\u201d He went on \u201cThere have now been three deaths Hattie\nStubbs Marlene Tucker old Merdell.\u201d\nShe said sharply\n\u201cMerdell That was an accident.",
    "He fell from the quay.",
    "He was very old\nhalfblind and hed been drinking in the pub.\u201d\n\u201cIt was not an accident.",
    "Merdell knew too much.\u201d\n\u201cWhat did he know\u201d\n\u201cHe recognised a face or a way of walking or a voice  something like\nthat.",
    "I talked to him the day I first came down here.",
    "He told me then all\nabout the Folliat family  about your fatherinlaw and your husband and\nyour sons who were killed in the war.",
    "Only  they were not both killed were\nthey Your son Henry went down with his ship but your second son James\nwas not killed.",
    "He deserted.",
    "He was reported at first perhaps Missing\nbelieved killed and later you told everyone that he was killed.",
    "It was\nnobodys business to disbelieve that statement.",
    "Why should they\u201d\nPoirot paused and then went on\nDo not imagine I have no sympathy for you Madame.",
    "Life has been\nhard for you I know.",
    "You can have had no real illusions about your younger\n\n\fson but he was your son and you loved him.",
    "You did all you could to give\nhim a new life.",
    "You had the charge of a young girl a subnormal but very\nrich girl.",
    "Oh yes she was rich.",
    "You gave out that her parents had lost all\ntheir money that she was poor and that you had advised her to marry a rich\nman many years older than herself.",
    "Why should anybody disbelieve your\nstory Again it was nobodys business.",
    "Her parents and near relatives had\nbeen killed.",
    "A firm of French lawyers in Paris acted as instructed by\nlawyers in San Miguel.",
    "On her marriage she assumed control of her own\nfortune.",
    "She was as you have told me docile affectionate suggestible.",
    "Everything her husband asked her to sign she signed.",
    "Securities were\nprobably changed and resold many times but in the end the desired\nfinancial result was reached.",
    "Sir George Stubbs the new personality\nassumed by your son became a rich man and his wife became a pauper.",
    "It is\nno legal offence to call yourself sir unless it is done to obtain money under\nfalse pretences.",
    "A title creates confidence  it suggests if not birth then\ncertainly riches.",
    "So the rich Sir George Stubbs older and changed in\nappearance and having grown a beard bought Nasse House and came to\nlive where he belonged though he had not been there since he was a boy.",
    "There was nobody left after the devastations of war who was likely to have\nrecognised him.",
    "But old Merdell did.",
    "He kept the knowledge to himself but\nwhen he said to me slyly that there would always be Folliats at Nasse\nHouse that was his own private joke.",
    "\u201cSo all had turned out well or so you thought.",
    "Your plan I fully\nbelieve stopped there.",
    "Your son had wealth his ancestral home and though\nhis wife was subnormal she was a beautiful and docile girl and you hoped\nhe would be kind to her and that she would be happy.\u201d\nMrs Folliat said in a low voice\n\u201cThats how I thought it would be  I would look after Hattie and care\nfor her.",
    "I never dreamed \u201d\n\u201cYou never dreamed  and your son carefully did not tell you that at the\ntime of the marriage he was already married.",
    "Oh yes  we have searched\nthe records for what we knew must exist.",
    "Your son had married a girl in\nTrieste a girl of the underground criminal world with whom he concealed\nhimself after his desertion.",
    "She had no mind to be parted from him nor for\nthat matter had he any intention of being parted from her.",
    "He accepted the\nmarriage with Hattie as a means to wealth but in his own mind he knew\nfrom the beginning what he intended to do.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cNo no I do not believe that I cannot believe it...",
    "It was that woman that wicked creature.\u201d\nPoirot went on inexorably\nHe meant murder.",
    "Hattie had no relations few friends.",
    "Immediately on\ntheir return to England he brought her here.",
    "The servants hardly saw her\nthat first evening and the woman they saw the next morning was not Hattie\nbut his Italian wife made up as Hattie and behaving roughly much as Hattie\nbehaved.",
    "And there again it might have ended.",
    "The false Hattie would have\nlived out her life as the real Hattie though doubtless her mental powers\nwould have unexpectedly improved owing to what would vaguely be called\nnew treatment.",
    "The secretary Miss Brewis already realised that there was\nvery little wrong with Lady Stubbss mental processes.",
    "But then a totally unforeseen thing happened.",
    "A cousin of Hatties\nwrote that he was coming to England on a yachting trip and although that\ncousin had not seen her for many years he would not be likely to be\ndeceived by an imposter.",
    "\u201cIt is odd\u201d said Poirot breaking off his narrative \u201cthat though the\nthought did cross my mind that De Sousa might not be De Sousa it never\noccurred to me that the truth lay the other way round  that is to say that\nHattie was not Hattie.\u201d\nHe went on\nThere might have been several different ways of meeting that situation.",
    "Lady Stubbs could have avoided a meeting with a plea of illness but if De\nSousa remained long in England she could hardly have continued to avoid\nmeeting him.",
    "And there was already another complication.",
    "Old Merdell\ngarrulous in his old age used to chatter to his granddaughter.",
    "She was\nprobably the only person who bothered to listen to him and even she\ndismissed most of what he said because she thought him batty.",
    "Nevertheless some of the things he said about having seen a womans body\nin the woods and Sir George Stubbs being really Mr James made\nsufficient impression on her to make her hint about them tentatively to Sir\nGeorge.",
    "In doing so of course she signed her own death warrant.",
    "Sir\nGeorge and his wife could take no chances of stories like that getting\naround.",
    "I imagine that he handed her out small sums of hush money and\nproceeded to make his plans.",
    "They worked out their scheme very carefully.",
    "They already knew the\ndate when De Sousa was due at Helmmouth.",
    "It coincided with the date\n\n\ffixed for the f\u043ate.",
    "They arranged their plan so that Marlene should be killed\nand Lady Stubbs disappear in conditions which should throw vague\nsuspicion on De Sousa.",
    "Hence the reference to his being a wicked man and\nthe accusation he kills people.",
    "Lady Stubbs was to disappear permanently\npossibly a conveniently unrecognisable body might be identified at some\ntime by Sir George and a new personality was to take her place.",
    "Actually\nHattie would merely resume her own Italian personality.",
    "All that was\nneeded was for her to double the parts over a period of a little more than\ntwentyfour hours.",
    "With the connivance of Sir George this was easy.",
    "On the\nday I arrived Lady Stubbs was supposed to have remained in her room\nuntil just before teatime.",
    "Nobody saw her there except Sir George.",
    "Actually\nshe slipped out took a bus or a train to Exeter and travelled from Exeter in\nthe company of another girl student several travel every day this time of\nyear to whom she confided her story of the friend who had eaten bad veal\nand ham pie.",
    "She arrives at the hostel books her cubicle and goes out to\nexplore.",
    "By tea time Lady Stubbs is in the drawingroom.",
    "After dinner\nLady Stubbs goes early to bed  but Miss Brewis caught a glimpse of her\nslipping out of the house a short while afterwards.",
    "She spends the night in\nthe hostel but is out early and is back at Nasse as Lady Stubbs for\nbreakfast.",
    "Again she spends a morning in her room with a headache and\nthis time manages to stage an appearance as a trespasser rebuffed by Sir\nGeorge from the window of his wifes room where he pretends to turn and\nspeak to his wife inside that room.",
    "The changes of costume were not\ndifficult  shorts and an open shirt under one of the elaborate dresses that\nLady Stubbs was fond of wearing.",
    "Heavy white makeup for Lady Stubbs\nwith a big coolie hat to shade her face a gay peasant scarf sunburned\ncomplexion and bronzered curls for the Italian girl.",
    "No one would have\ndreamed that those two were the same woman.",
    "And so the final drama was staged.",
    "Just before four oclock Lady\nStubbs told Miss Brewis to take a teatray down to Marlene.",
    "That was\nbecause she was afraid such an idea might occur to Miss Brewis\nindependently and it would be fatal if Miss Brewis should inconveniently\nappear at the wrong moment.",
    "Perhaps too she had a malicious pleasure in\narranging for Miss Brewis to be at the scene of the crime at approximately\nthe time it was committed.",
    "Then choosing her moment she slipped into the\nempty fortunetelling tent out through the back and into the summerhouse\nin the shrubbery where she kept her hikers rucksack with its change of\n\n\fcostume.",
    "She slipped through the woods called to Marlene to let her in and\nstrangled the unsuspecting girl then and there.",
    "The big coolie hat she threw\ninto the river then she changed into her hiker dress and makeup packed up\nher cyclamen georgette dress and highheeled shoes in the rucksack  and\npresently an Italian student from the youth hostel joined her Dutch\nacquaintance at the shows on the lawn and left with her by the local bus as\nplanned.",
    "Where she is now I do not know.",
    "I suspect in Soho where she\ndoubtless has underworld affiliations of her own nationality who can\nprovide her with the necessary papers.",
    "In any case it is not for an Italian\ngirl that the police are looking it is for Hattie Stubbs simple subnormal\nexotic.",
    "\u201cBut poor Hattie Stubbs is dead as you yourself Madame know only\ntoo well.",
    "You revealed that knowledge when I spoke to you in the drawingroom on the day of the f\u043ate.",
    "The death of Marlene had been a bad shock to\nyou  you had not had the least idea of what was planned but you revealed\nvery clearly though I was dense enough not to see it at the time that when\nyou talked of Hattie you were talking of two different people  one a\nwoman you disliked who would be better dead and against whom you\nwarned me not to believe a word she said  the other a girl of whom you\nspoke in the past tense and whom you defended with a warm affection.",
    "I\nthink Madame that you were very fond of poor Hattie Stubbs...\u201d\nThere was a long pause.",
    "Mrs Folliat sat quite still in her chair.",
    "At last she roused herself and\nspoke.",
    "Her voice had the coldness of ice.",
    "\u201cYour whole story is quite fantastic M. Poirot.",
    "I really think you must\nbe mad... All this is entirely in your head you have no evidence\nwhatsoever.\u201d\nPoirot went across to one of the windows and opened it.",
    "\u201cListen Madame.",
    "What do you hear\u201d\n\u201cI am a little deaf... What should I hear\u201d\n\u201cThe blows of a pick axe...",
    "They are breaking up the concrete\nfoundation of the Folly... What a good place to bury a body  where a tree\nhas been uprooted and the earth is already disturbed.",
    "A little later to make\nall safe concrete over the ground where the body lies and on the concrete\nerect a Folly...\u201d He added gently \u201cSir Georges Folly...",
    "The Folly of the\nowner of Nasse House.\u201d\nA long shuddering sigh escaped Mrs Folliat.",
    "\u201cSuch a beautiful place\u201d said Poirot.",
    "\u201cOnly one thing evil...",
    "The man\nwho owns it...\u201d\n\u201cI know.\u201d Her words came hoarsely.",
    "\u201cI have always known...",
    "Even as a\nchild he frightened me... Ruthless...",
    "Without pity... And without\nconscience...",
    "But he was my son and I loved him...",
    "I should have spoken\nout after Hatties death...",
    "But he was my son.",
    "How could I be the one to give\nhim up And so because of my silence  that poor silly child was killed...\nAnd after her dear old Merdell... Where would it have ended\u201d\n\u201cWith a murderer it does not end\u201d said Poirot.",
    "She bowed her head.",
    "For a moment or two she stayed so her hands\ncovering her eyes.",
    "Then Mrs Folliat of Nasse House daughter of a long line of brave men\ndrew herself erect.",
    "She looked straight at Poirot and her voice was formal\nand remote.",
    "\u201cThank you M. Poirot\u201d she said \u201cfor coming to tell me yourself of all\nthis.",
    "Will you leave me now There are some things that one has to face\nquite alone...\u201d"
