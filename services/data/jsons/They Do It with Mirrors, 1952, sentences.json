    "Mrs Van Rydock stood in front of the glass in her\npeach satin slip.",
    "She was exquisitely corseted.",
    "Her still\nshapely legs were encased in \ufb01ne nylon stockings.",
    "Her\nface beneath a layer of cosmetics and constantly toned\n7\n\n\nup by massage appeared almost girlish at a slight distance.",
    "Her hair was less grey than tending to hydrangea\nblue and was perfectly set.",
    "It was practically impossible\nwhen looking at Mrs Van Rydock to imagine what she\nwould be like in a natural state.",
    "Everything that money\ncould do had been done for her \u2013 reinforced by diet\nmassage and constant exercises.",
    "Ruth Van Rydock looked humorously at her friend.",
    "\u2018Do you think most people would guess Jane that\nyou and I are practically the same age\u2019\nMiss Marple responded loyally.",
    "\u2018Not for a moment I\u2019m sure\u2019 she said reassuringly.",
    "\u2018I\u2019m afraid you know that I look every minute of\nmy age\u2019\nMiss Marple was whitehaired with a soft pink and\nwhite wrinkled face and innocent china blue eyes.",
    "She\nlooked a very sweet old lady.",
    "Nobody would have\ncalled Mrs Van Rydock a sweet old lady.",
    "\u2018I guess you do Jane\u2019 said Mrs Van Rydock.",
    "She\ngrinned suddenly \u2018And so do I.",
    "Only not in the same\nway.",

    "She looked somehow an\nincongruous \ufb01gure in the ornate bedroom of the expensive hotel suite.",
    "She was dressed in rather dowdy\nblack carried a large shopping bag and looked every\ninch a lady.",
    "\u2018I\u2019m worried Jane.",
    "About Carrie Louise.\u2019\n\u2018Carrie Louise\u2019 Miss Marple repeated the name\nmusingly.",
    "The sound of it took her a long way back.",
    "The pensionnat in Florence.",

    "Their ways diverging\nalmost at once and yet the old affection persisting\noccasional letters remembrances at Christmas.",
    "Strange\nthat Ruth whose home \u2013 or rather homes \u2013 had been\nin America should be the sister whom she had seen\n9\n\n\fp\n\nq\n\nthe more often of the two.",
    "No perhaps not strange.",
    "Like most Americans of her class Ruth had been\ncosmopolitan every year or two she had come over\nto Europe rushing from London to Paris on to the\nRiviera and back again and always keen to snatch a few\nmoments wherever she was with her old friends.",
    "There\nhad been many meetings like this one.",

    "A\nrecherche\u0301 meal affectionate reminiscences and a hurried and affectionate goodbye.",
    "Ruth had never had time\nto visit St Mary Mead.",
    "Miss Marple had not indeed\never expected it.",
    "Everyone\u2019s life has a tempo.",
    "Ruth\u2019s was\npresto whereas Miss Marple\u2019s was content to be adagio.",
    "So it was American Ruth whom she had seen most\nof whereas Carrie Louise who lived in England she\nhad not now seen for over twenty years.",
    "Odd but\nquite natural because when one lives in the same\ncountry there is no need to arrange meetings with\nold friends.",
    "One assumes that sooner or later one\nwill see them without contrivance.",
    "Only if you move\nin different spheres that does not happen.",
    "The paths\nof Jane Marple and Carrie Louise did not cross.",
    "It was\nas simple as that.",
    "\u2018Why are you worried about Carrie Louise Ruth\u2019\nasked Miss Marple.",

    "It\nwould be dif\ufb01cult to imagine Carrie Louise unhappy\n\u2013 and yet there were times in her life when she must\nhave been.",
    "Only \u2013 the picture did not come clearly.",
    "Bewildered \u2013 yes \u2013 incredulous \u2013 yes \u2013 but violent\ngrief \u2013 no.",

    "\u2018Carrie Louise\u2019 she said \u2018has always lived right out\nof this world.",
    "She doesn\u2019t know what it\u2019s like.",
    "Maybe\nit\u2019s that that worries me.\u2019\n\u2018Her circumstances\u2019 began Miss Marple then\nstopped shaking her head.",
    "\u2018No\u2019 she said.",
    "\u2018No it\u2019s she herself\u2019 said Ruth Van Rydock.",
    "\u2018Carrie\nLouise was always the one of us who had ideals.",
    "Of\ncourse it was the fashion when we were young to have\nideals \u2013 we all had them it was the proper thing for\nyoung girls.",
    "You were going to nurse lepers Jane and I\nwas going to be a nun.",
    "One gets over all that nonsense.",
    "Marriage I suppose one might say knocks it out of\none.",
    "Still take it by and large I haven\u2019t done badly\nout of marriage.\u2019\n11\n\n\fp\n\nq\n\nMiss Marple thought that Ruth was expressing it\nmildly.",
    "Ruth had been married three times each time\nto an extremely wealthy man and the resultant divorces\nhad increased her bank balance without in the least\nsouring her disposition.",
    "\u2018Of course\u2019 said Mrs Van Rydock \u2018I\u2019ve always been\ntough.",
    "Things don\u2019t get me down.",
    "I\u2019ve not expected\ntoo much of life and certainly not expected too much\nof men \u2013 and I\u2019ve done very well out of it \u2013 and no\nhard feelings.",
    "Tommy and I are still excellent friends\nand Julius often asks me my opinion about the market.\u2019\nHer face darkened.",
    "\u2018I believe that\u2019s what worries me\nabout Carrie Louise \u2013 she\u2019s always had a tendency\nyou know to marry cranks.\u2019\n\u2018Cranks\u2019\n\u2018People with ideals.",
    "Carrie Louise was always a\npushover for ideals.",
    "There she was as pretty as they\nmake them just seventeen and listening with her eyes as\nbig as saucers to old Gulbrandsen holding forth about\nhis plans for the human race.",
    "Over \ufb01fty and she married him a widower with a family of grownup children\n\u2013 all because of his philanthropic ideas.",
    "She used to\nsit listening to him spellbound.",
    "Just like Desdemona\nand Othello.",
    "Only fortunately there was no Iago about\nto mess things up \u2013 and anyway Gulbrandsen wasn\u2019t\ncoloured.",
    "He was a Swede or a Norwegian or something.\u2019\n12\n\n\fThey do it with Mirrors\n\nMiss Marple nodded thoughtfully.",
    "The name of\nGulbrandsen had an international signi\ufb01cance.",
    "A man\nwho with shrewd business acumen and perfect honesty had built up a fortune so colossal that really\nphilanthropy had been the only solution to the disposal of it.",
    "The name still held signi\ufb01cance.",
    "The\nGulbrandsen Trust the Gulbrandsen Research Fellowships the Gulbrandsen Administrative Almshouses\nand best known of all the vast educational College\nfor the sons of working men.",
    "\u2018She didn\u2019t marry him for his money you know\u2019 said\nRuth \u2018I should have if I\u2019d married him at all.",
    "But not\nCarrie Louise.",
    "I don\u2019t know what would have happened\nif he hadn\u2019t died when she was thirtytwo.",
    "Thirtytwo\u2019s\na very nice age for a widow.",
    "She\u2019s got experience but\nshe\u2019s still adaptable.\u2019\nThe spinster listening to her nodded gently whilst\nher mind revived tentatively widows she had known\nin the village of St Mary Mead.",
    "\u2018I was really happiest about Carrie Louise when she\nwas married to Johnnie Restarick.",
    "Of course he married\nher for her money \u2013 or if not exactly that at any rate\nhe wouldn\u2019t have married her if she hadn\u2019t had any.",
    "Johnnie was a sel\ufb01sh pleasureloving lazy hound but\nthat\u2019s so much safer than a crank.",
    "All Johnnie wanted\nwas to live soft.",
    "He wanted Carrie Louise to go to the\nbest dressmakers and have yachts and cars and enjoy\n13\n\n\fp\n\nq\n\nherself with him.",
    "That kind of man is so very safe.",
    "Give him comfort and luxury and he\u2019ll purr like a\ncat and be absolutely charming to you.",
    "I never took\nthat scene designing and theatrical stuff of his very\nseriously.",
    "But Carrie Louise was thrilled by it \u2013 saw\nit all as Art with a capital A and really forced him\nback into those surroundings and then that dreadful\nYugoslavian woman got hold of him and just swept\nhim off with her.",
    "He didn\u2019t really want to go.",
    "If Carrie\nLouise had waited and been sensible he would have\ncome back to her.\u2019\n\u2018Did she care very much\u2019 asked Miss Marple.",
    "\u2018That\u2019s the funny thing.",
    "I don\u2019t really believe she\ndid.",
    "She was absolutely sweet about it all \u2013 but then\nshe would be.",
    "She is sweet.",
    "Quite anxious to divorce\nhim so that he and that creature could get married.",
    "And offering to give those two boys of his by his \ufb01rst\nmarriage a home with her because it would be more\nsettled for them.",
    "So there poor Johnnie was \u2013 he had to\nmarry the woman and she led him an awful six months\nand then drove him over a precipice in a car in a \ufb01t of\nrage.",
    "They said it was an accident but I think it was\njust temper\u2019\nMrs Van Rydock paused took up a mirror and gazed\nat her face searchingly.",
    "She picked up her eyebrow\ntweezers and pulled out a hair.",
    "\u2018And what does Carrie Louise do next but marry\n14\n\n\fThey do it with Mirrors\n\nthis man Lewis Serrocold.",
    "Another crank Another\nman with ideals Oh I don\u2019t say he isn\u2019t devoted to\nher \u2013 I think he is \u2013 but he\u2019s bitten by that same bug\nof wanting to improve everybody\u2019s lives for them.",
    "And\nreally you know nobody can do that but yourself.\u2019\n\u2018I wonder\u2019 said Miss Marple.",
    "\u2018Only of course there\u2019s a fashion in these things\njust like there is in clothes.",
    "My dear have you seen\nwhat Christian Dior is trying to make us wear in the\nway of skirts Where was I Oh yes Fashion.",
    "Well\nthere\u2019s a fashion in philanthropy too.",
    "It used to be\neducation in Gulbrandsen\u2019s day.",
    "But that\u2019s out of\ndate now.",
    "The State has stepped in.",
    "Everyone expects\neducation as a matter of right \u2013 and doesn\u2019t think much\nof it when they get it Juvenile Delinquency \u2013 that\u2019s\nwhat is the rage nowadays.",
    "All these young criminals\nand potential criminals.",
    "Everyone\u2019s mad about them.",
    "You should see Lewis Serrocold\u2019s eyes sparkle behind\nthose thick glasses of his.",
    "Crazy with enthusiasm One\nof those men of enormous will power who like living\non a banana and a piece of toast and put all their\nenergies into a Cause.",
    "And Carrie Louise eats it up\n\u2013 just as she always did.",
    "But I don\u2019t like it Jane.",
    "They\u2019ve had meetings of the Trustees and the whole\nplace has been turned over to this new idea.",
    "It\u2019s a\ntraining establishment now for these juvenile criminals\ncomplete with psychiatrists and psychologists and all\n15\n\n\fp\n\nq\n\nthe rest of it.",
    "There Lewis and Carrie Louise are living\nthere surrounded by these boys \u2013 who aren\u2019t perhaps\nquite normal.",
    "And the place stiff with occupational\ntherapists and teachers and enthusiasts half of them\nquite mad.",
    "Cranks all the lot of them and my little\nCarrie Louise in the middle of it all\u2019\nShe paused \u2013 and stared helplessly at Miss Marple.",
    "Miss Marple said in a faintly puzzled voice\n\u2018But you haven\u2019t told me yet Ruth what you are\nreally afraid of.\u2019\n\u2018I tell you I don\u2019t know And that\u2019s what worries me.",
    "I\u2019ve just been down there \u2013 for a \ufb02ying visit.",
    "And I felt\nall along that there was something wrong.",
    "In the atmosphere \u2013 in the house \u2013 I know I\u2019m not mistaken.",
    "I\u2019m\nsensitive to atmosphere always have been.",
    "Did I ever\ntell you how I urged Julius to sell out of Amalgamated\nCereals before the crash came And wasn\u2019t I right Yes\nsomething is wrong down there.",
    "But I don\u2019t know why\nor what \u2013 if it\u2019s these dreadful young jailbirds \u2013 or if\nit\u2019s nearer home.",
    "I can\u2019t say what it is.",
    "There\u2019s Lewis\njust living for his ideas and not noticing anything else\nand Carrie Louise bless her never seeing or hearing\nor thinking anything except what\u2019s a lovely sight or\na lovely sound or a lovely thought.",
    "It\u2019s sweet but it\nisn\u2019t practical.",
    "There is such a thing as evil \u2013 and I\nwant you Jane to go down there right away and \ufb01nd\nout just exactly what\u2019s the matter.\u2019\n16\n\n\fThey do it with Mirrors\n\n\u2018Me\u2019 exclaimed Miss Marple.",
    "\u2018Why me\u2019\n\u2018Because you\u2019ve got a nose for that sort of thing.",
    "You always had.",
    "You\u2019ve always been a sweet innocentlooking creature Jane and all the time underneath\nnothing has ever surprised you you always believe\nthe worst.\u2019\n\u2018The worst is so often true\u2019 murmured Miss Marple.",
    "\u2018Why you have such a poor idea of human nature\nI can\u2019t think \u2013 living in that sweet peaceful village of\nyours so old world and pure.\u2019\n\u2018You have never lived in a village Ruth.",
    "The things\nthat go on in a pure peaceful village would probably\nsurprise you.\u2019\n\u2018Oh I daresay.",
    "My point is that they don\u2019t surprise\nyou.",
    "So you will go down to Stonygates and \ufb01nd out\nwhat\u2019s wrong won\u2019t you\u2019\n\u2018But Ruth dear that would be a most dif\ufb01cult\nthing to do.\u2019\n\u2018No it wouldn\u2019t.",
    "I\u2019ve thought it all out.",
    "If you won\u2019t\nbe absolutely mad at me I\u2019ve prepared the ground\nalready.\u2019\nMrs Van Rydock paused eyed Miss Marple rather\nuneasily lighted a cigarette and plunged rather nervously into explanation.",
    "\u2018You\u2019ll admit I\u2019m sure that things have been dif\ufb01cult in this country since the war for people with small\n\ufb01xed incomes \u2013 for people like you that is to say Jane.\u2019\n17\n\n\fp\n\nq\n\n\u2018Oh yes indeed.",
    "But for the kindness the really great\nkindness of my nephew Raymond I don\u2019t know really\nwhere I should be.\u2019\n\u2018Never mind your nephew\u2019 said Mrs Van Rydock.",
    "\u2018Carrie Louise knows nothing about your nephew \u2013 or\nif she does she knows him as a writer and has no idea\nthat he\u2019s your nephew.",
    "The point as I put it to Carrie\nLouise is that it\u2019s just too bad about dear Jane.",
    "Really\nsometimes hardly enough to eat and of course far too\nproud ever to appeal to old friends.",
    "One couldn\u2019t I\nsaid suggest money \u2013 but a nice long rest in lovely\nsurroundings with an old friend and with plenty of\nnourishing food and no cares or worries\u2019 \u2013 Ruth Van\nRydock paused and then added de\ufb01antly \u2018Now go on\n\u2013 be mad at me if you want to be.\u2019\nMiss Marple opened her china blue eyes in gentle\nsurprise.",
    "\u2018But why should I be mad at you Ruth A very\ningenious and plausible approach.",
    "I\u2019m sure Carrie\nLouise responded.\u2019\n\u2018She\u2019s writing to you.",
    "You\u2019ll \ufb01nd the letter when you\nget back.",
    "Honestly Jane you don\u2019t feel that I\u2019ve taken\nan unpardonable liberty You won\u2019t mind \u2013\u2019\nShe hesitated and Miss Marple put her thoughts\ndeftly into words.",
    "\u2018Going to Stonygates as an object of charity \u2013 more\nor less under false pretences Not in the least \u2013 if it is\n18\n\n\fThey do it with Mirrors\n\nnecessary.",
    "You think it is necessary \u2013 and I am inclined\nto agree with you.\u2019\nMrs Van Rydock stared at her.",
    "\u2018But why What have you heard\u2019\n\u2018I haven\u2019t heard anything.",
    "It\u2019s just your conviction.",
    "You\u2019re not a fanciful woman Ruth.\u2019\n\u2018No but I haven\u2019t anything de\ufb01nite to go upon.\u2019\n\u2018I remember\u2019 said Miss Marple thoughtfully \u2018one\nSunday morning at church \u2013 it was the second Sunday\nin Advent \u2013 sitting behind Grace Lamble and feeling\nmore and more worried about her.",
    "Quite sure you\nknow that something was wrong \u2013 badly wrong \u2013 and\nyet being quite unable to say why.",
    "A most disturbing\nfeeling and very very de\ufb01nite.\u2019\n\u2018And was there something wrong\u2019\n\u2018Oh yes.",
    "Her father the old Admiral had been very\npeculiar for some time and the very next day he went\nfor her with the coal hammer roaring out that she was\nAntichrist masquerading as his daughter.",
    "He nearly\nkilled her.",
    "They took him away to the asylum and she\neventually recovered after months in hospital \u2013 but it\nwas a very near thing.\u2019\n\u2018And you\u2019d actually had a premonition that day in\nchurch\u2019\n\u2018I wouldn\u2019t call it a premonition.",
    "It was founded on\nfact \u2013 these things usually are though one doesn\u2019t\nalways recognise it at the time.",
    "She was wearing her\n19\n\n\fp\n\nq\n\nSunday hat the wrong way round.",
    "Very signi\ufb01cant\nreally because Grace Lamble was a most precise\nwoman not at all vague or absentminded \u2013 and\nthe circumstances under which she would not notice\nwhich way her hat was put on to go to church\nwere really extremely limited.",
    "Her father you see\nhad thrown a marble paperweight at her and it had\nshattered the lookingglass.",
    "She had caught up her\nhat put it on and hurried out of the house.",
    "Anxious\nto keep up appearances and for the servants not to hear\nanything.",
    "She put down these actions you see to \u201cdear\nPapa\u2019s Naval temper\u201d she didn\u2019t realise that his mind\nwas de\ufb01nitely unhinged.",
    "Though she ought to have\nrealised it clearly enough.",
    "He was always complaining\nto her of being spied upon and of enemies \u2013 all the\nusual symptoms in fact.\u2019\nMrs Van Rydock gazed respectfully at her friend.",
    "\u2018Maybe Jane\u2019 she said \u2018that St Mary Mead of\nyours isn\u2019t quite the idyllic retreat that I\u2019ve always\nimagined it.\u2019\n\u2018Human nature dear is very much the same everywhere.",
    "It is more dif\ufb01cult to observe it closely in a city\nthat is all.\u2019\n\u2018And you\u2019ll go to Stonygates\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019ll go to Stonygates.",
    "A little unfair perhaps on\nmy nephew Raymond.",
    "To let it be thought that he\ndoes not assist me I mean.",
    "Still the dear boy is in\n20\n\n\fThey do it with Mirrors\n\nMexico for six months.",

    "Three weeks perhaps \u2013 a month.",
    "That\nshould be ample.\u2019\n\u2018For you to \ufb01nd out what is wrong\u2019\n\u2018For me to \ufb01nd out what is wrong.\u2019\n\u2018My Jane\u2019 said Mrs Van Rydock \u2018you\u2019ve got a lot\nof con\ufb01dence in yourself haven\u2019t you\u2019\nMiss Marple looked faintly reproachful.",

    "Serrocold nodded.",
    "\u2018Yes it was as you can imagine a tremendous shock\nto me.",
    "I had had no suspicion of such a thing myself\nbut as soon as Christian told me I realized that certain\nsymptoms my wife had complained of lately were\nquite compatible with that belief.",
    "What she took to be\nrheumatism leg cramps pain and occasional sickness.",
    "All that \ufb01ts in very well with the symptoms of arsenical\npoisoning.\u2019\n134\n\n\fThey do it with Mirrors\n\n\u2018Miss Marple told us that Christian Gulbrandsen\nasked her about the condition of Mrs Serrocold\u2019s\nheart.\u2019\n\u2018Did he now That\u2019s interesting.",
    "I suppose he thought\nthat a heart poison would be used since it paved the\nway to a sudden death without undue suspicion.",
    "But\nI think myself that arsenic is more likely.\u2019\n\u2018You de\ufb01nitely think then that Christian Gulbrandsen\u2019s suspicions were well founded\u2019\n\u2018Oh yes I think so.",
    "For one thing Gulbrandsen\nwould hardly come to me with such a suggestion\nunless he was fairly sure of his facts.",

    "Our interview was\na hurried one.",
    "It served only the purpose of explaining\nhis visit and a mutual agreement that nothing whatever\nshould be said to my wife about the matter until we\nwere sure of our facts.\u2019\n\u2018And whom did he suspect of administering poison\u2019\n\u2018He did not say and actually I don\u2019t think he knew.",
    "He may have suspected.",
    "I think now that he probably\ndid suspect \u2013 otherwise why should he be killed\u2019\n\u2018But he mentioned no name to you\u2019\n\u2018He mentioned no name.",

    "I gather that the operations and the rami\ufb01cations are so complicated that it\nwill be months before the auditors can unravel it all.",
    "But the net result seems to be that under various names\nand banking accounts and companies Lewis Serrocold\nwould have been able to dispose of a colossal sum with\nwhich he intended to establish an overseas colony for a\ncooperative experiment in which juvenile delinquents\nshould eventually own this territory and administer it.",
