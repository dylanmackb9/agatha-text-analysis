    "THE MURDER AT THE VICARAGE\n\nAgatha Christie\n\n\fChapter I\n\n\fIt is difficult to know quite where to begin this story but I have\nfixed my choice on a certain Wednesday at luncheon at the\nVicarage.",
    "The conversation though in the main irrelevant to the\nmatter in hand yet contained one or two suggestive incidents\nwhich influenced later developments.",
    "I had just finished carving some boiled beef remarkably tough\nby the way and on resuming my seat I remarked in a spirit most\nunbecoming to my cloth that any one who murdered Colonel\nProtheroe would be doing the world at large a service.",
    "My young nephew Dennis said instantly\n\nThatll be remembered against you when the old boy is found\nbathed in blood.",
    "Mary will give evidence wont you Mary And\ndescribe how you brandished the carving knife in a vindictive\nmanner.",
    "Mary who is in service at the Vicarage as a steppingstone to\nbetter things and higher wages merely said in a loud\n\n\fbusinesslike voice Greens and thrust a cracked dish at him in\na truculent manner.",
    "My wife said in a sympathetic voice Has he been very trying\n\nI did not reply at once for Mary setting the greens on the table\nwith a bang proceeded to thrust a dish of singularly moist and\nunpleasant dumplings under my nose.",
    "I said No thank you\nand she deposited the dish with a clatter on the table and left the\nroom.",
    "It is a pity that I am such a shocking housekeeper said my\nwife with a tinge of genuine regret in her voice.",
    "I was inclined to agree with her.",
    "My wifes name is Griselda \u2014 a\nhighly suitable name for a parsons wife.",
    "But there the suitability\nends.",
    "She is not in the least meek.",
    "I have always been of the opinion that a clergyman should be\nunmarried.",
    "Why I should have urged Griselda to marry me at the\nend of twentyfours hours acquaintance is a mystery to me.",
    "Marriage I have always held is a serious affair to be entered\ninto only after long deliberation and forethought and suitability\nof tastes and inclinations is the most important consideration.",
    "Griselda is nearly twenty years younger than myself.",
    "She is most\ndistractingly pretty and quite incapable of taking anything\nseriously.",
    "She is incompetent in every way and extremely trying\nto live with.",
    "She treats the parish as a kind of huge joke arranged\nfor her amusement.",
    "I have endeavoured to form her mind and\nfailed.",
    "I am more than ever convinced that celibacy is desirable\nfor the clergy.",
    "I have frequently hinted as much to Griselda but\nshe has only laughed.",
    "My dear I said if you would only exercise a little care \u2014\n\nI do sometimes said Griselda.",
    "But on the whole I think\nthings go worse when Im trying.",
    "Im evidently not a housekeeper\nby nature.",
    "I find it better to leave things to Mary and just make up\nmy mind to be uncomfortable and have nasty things to eat.",
    "And what about your husband my dear I said reproachfully\nand proceeding to follow the example of the devil in quoting\nScripture for his own ends I added She looketh to the ways of\nher household .",
    ". .",
    "Think how lucky you are not to be torn to pieces by lions said\nGriselda quickly interrupting.",
    "Or burnt at the stake.",
    "Bad food\nand lots of dust and dead wasps is really nothing to make a fuss\nabout.",
    "Tell me more about Colonel Protheroe.",
    "At any rate the\nearly Christians were lucky enough not to have churchwardens.",
    "Pompous old brute said Dennis.",
    "No wonder his first wife ran\naway from him.",
    "I dont see what else she could do said my wife.",
    "Griselda I said sharply.",
    "I will not have you speaking in that\nway.",
    "Darling said my wife affectionately.",
    "Tell me about him.",
    "What\nwas the trouble Was it Mr. Hawess becking and nodding and\ncrossing himself every other minute\n\nHawes is our new curate.",
    "He has been with us just over three\nweeks.",
    "He has High Church views and fasts on Fridays.",
    "Colonel\nProtheroe is a great opposer of ritual in any form.",
    "Not this time.",
    "He did touch on it in passing.",
    "No the whole\ntrouble arose out of Mrs. Price Ridleys wretched pound note.",
    "Mrs. Price Ridley is a devout member of my congregation.",
    "Attending early service on the anniversary of her sons death\nshe put a pound note into the offertory bag.",
    "Later reading the\namount of the collection posted up she was pained to observe\nthat one tenshilling note was the highest item mentioned.",
    "She complained to me about it and I pointed out very\nreasonably that she must have made a mistake.",
    "Were none of us so young as we were I said trying to turn it\noff tactfully.",
    "And we must pay the penalty of advancing years.",
    "Strangely enough my words only seemed to incense her further.",
    "She said that things had a very odd look and that she was\nsurprised I didnt think so also.",
    "And she flounced away and I\ngather took her troubles to Colonel Protheroe.",
    "Protheroe is the\nkind of man who enjoys making a fuss on every conceivable\noccasion.",
    "He made a fuss.",
    "It is a pity he made it on a Wednesday.",
    "I teach in the Church Day School on Wednesday mornings a\nproceeding that causes me acute nervousness and leaves me\nunsettled for the rest of the day.",
    "Well I suppose he must have some fun said my wife with the\nair of trying to sum up the position impartially.",
    "Nobody flutters\nround him and calls him the dear vicar and embroiders awful\nslippers for him and gives him bedsocks for Christmas.",
    "Both\nhis wife and his daughter are fed to the teeth with him.",
    "I suppose\nit makes him happy to feel important somewhere.",
    "He neednt be offensive about it I said with some heat.",
    "I dont\nthink he quite realised the implications of what he was saying.",
    "He wants to go over all the Church accounts \u2014 in case of\ndefalcations \u2014 that was the word he used.",
    "Defalcations Does he\nsuspect me of embezzling the Church funds.",
    "Nobody would suspect you of anything darling said Griselda.",
    "Youre so transparently above suspicion that really it would be a\nmarvellous opportunity.",
    "I wish youd embezzle the S.P.G.",
    "funds.",
    "I\nhate missionaries \u2014 I always have.",
    "I would have reproved her for that sentiment but Mary entered\nat that moment with a partially cooked rice pudding.",
    "I made a\nmild protest but Griselda said that the Japanese always ate halfcooked rice and had marvellous brains in consequence.",
    "I dare say she said that if you had a rice pudding like this\nevery day till Sunday youd preach the most marvellous\nsermon.",
    "Heaven forbid I said with a shudder.",
    "Protheroes coming over tomorrow evening and were going\nover the accounts together I went on.",
    "I must finish preparing\nmy talk for the C.E.M.S.",
    "today.",
    "Looking up a reference I became\nso engrossed in Canon Shirleys Reality that I havent got on as\nwell as I should.",
    "What are you doing this afternoon Griselda\n\nMy duty said Griselda.",
    "My duty as the Vicaress.",
    "Tea and\nscandal at fourthirty.",
    "Who is coming\n\nGriselda ticked off on her fingers with a glow of virtue on her\nface.",
    "Mrs. Price Ridley Miss Wetherby Miss Hartnell and that\nterrible Miss Marple.",
    "I rather like Miss Marple I said.",
    "She has at least a sense of\nhumour.",
    "Shes the worst cat in the village said Griselda.",
    "And she\nalways knows every single thing that happens \u2014 and draws the\nworst inferences from it.",
    "Griselda as I have said is much younger than I am.",
    "At my time of\nlife one knows that the worst is usually true.",
    "Well dont expect me in for tea Griselda said Dennis.",
    "Beast said Griselda.",
    "Yes but look here the Protheroes really did ask me for tennis\nto day.",
    "Beast said Griselda again.",
    "Dennis beat a prudent retreat and Griselda and I went together\ninto my study.",
    "I wonder what we shall have for tea said Griselda seating\nherself on my writingtable.",
    "Dr. Stone and Miss Cram I\n\n\fsuppose and perhaps Mrs. Lestrange.",
    "By the way I called on\nher yesterday but she was out.",
    "Yes Im sure we shall have Mrs.\nLestrange for tea.",
    "Its so mysterious isnt it her arriving like this\nand taking a house down here and hardly every going outside\nit Makes one think of detective stories.",
    "You know \u2014 Who was\nshe the mysterious woman with the pale beautiful face What\nwas her past history Nobody knew.",
    "There was something\nfaintly sinister about her.",
    "I believe Dr. Haydock knows\nsomething about her.",
    "You read too many detective stories Griselda I observed\nmildly.",
    "What about you she retorted.",
    "I was looking everywhere for\nThe Stain on the Stairs the other day when you were in here\nwriting a sermon.",
    "And at last I came in to ask you if youd seen it\nanywhere and what did I find\n\nI had the grace to blush.",
    "I picked it up at random.",
    "A chance sentence caught my eye and\n\u2014\n\nI know those chance sentences said Griselda.",
    "She quoted\nimpressively And then a very curious thing happened \u2014\nGriselda rose crossed the room and kissed her elderly husband\naffectionately.",
    "She suited the action to the word.",
    "Is that a very curious thing I inquired.",
    "Of course it is said Griselda.",
    "Do you realise Len that I might\nhave married a Cabinet Minister a Baronet a rich Company\nPromoter three subalterns and a neerdowell with attractive\nmanners and that instead I chose you Didnt it astonish you\nvery much\n\nAt the time it did I replied.",
    "I have often wondered why you did\nit.",
    "Griselda laughed.",
    "It made me feel so powerful she murmured.",
    "The others\nthought me simply wonderful and of course it would have been\nvery nice for them to have me.",
    "But Im everything you most\ndislike and disapprove of and yet you couldnt withstand me My\nvanity couldnt hold out against that.",
    "Its so much nicer to be a\nsecret and delightful sin to anybody than to be a feather in their\ncap.",
    "I make you frightfully uncomfortable and stir you up the\nwrong way the whole time and yet you adore me madly.",
    "You\nadore me madly dont you\n\nNaturally I am very fond of you my dear.",
    "Oh Len you adore me.",
    "Do you remember that day when I\nstayed up in town and sent you a wire you never got because the\npostmistresss sister was having twins and she forgot to send it\nround The state you got into and you telephoned Scotland Yard\nand made the most frightful fuss.",
    "There are things one hates being reminded of.",
    "I had really been\nstrangely foolish on the occasion in question.",
    "I said\n\n\fIf you dont mind dear I want to get on with the C.E.M.S.",
    "Griselda gave a sigh of intense irritation ruffled my hair up on\nend smoothed it down again said\n\nYou dont deserve me.",
    "You really dont.",
    "Ill have an affair with\nthe artist.",
    "I will \u2014 really and truly.",
    "And then think of the scandal\nin the parish.",
    "Theres a good deal already I said mildly.",
    "Griselda laughed blew me a kiss and departed through the\nwindow.",
    "Chapter II\n\nGriselda is a very irritating woman.",
    "On leaving the luncheon\ntable I had felt myself to be in a good mood for preparing a\nreally forceful address for the Church of England Mens Society.",
    "Now I felt restless and disturbed.",
    "Just when I was really settling down to it Lettice Protheroe\ndrifted in.",
    "I use the word drifted advisedly.",
    "I have read novels in which\nyoung people are described as bursting with energy \u2014 joie de\nvivre the magnificent vitality of youth .",
    ". .",
    "Personally all the\nyoung people I came across have the air of animal wraiths.",
    "Lettice was particularly wraithlike this afternoon.",
    "She is a pretty\ngirl very tall and fair and completely vague.",
    "She drifted through\nthe French window absently pulled off the yellow beret she was\nwearing and murmured vaguely with a kind of faraway surprise\nOh its you.",
    "There is a path from Old Hall through the woods which comes\nout by our garden gate so that most people coming from there\ncome in at that gate and up to the study window instead of going\na long way round by the road and coming to the front door.",
    "I was\nnot surprised at Lettice coming in this way but I did a little\nresent her attitude.",
    "If you come to a Vicarage you ought to be prepared to find a\nVicar.",
    "She came in and collapsed in a crumpled heap in one of my big\narmchairs.",
    "She plucked aimlessly at her hair staring at the\nceiling.",
    "Is Dennis anywhere about\n\nI havent seen him since lunch.",
    "I understood he was going to\nplay tennis at your place.",
    "Oh said Lettice.",
    "I hope he isnt.",
    "He wont find anybody there.",
    "He said you asked him.",
    "I believe I did.",
    "Only that was Friday.",
    "And todays Tuesday.",
    "Its Wednesday I said.",
    "Oh how dreadful said Lettice.",
    "That means that Ive forgotten\nto go to lunch with some people for the third time.",
    "Fortunately it didnt seem to worry her much.",
    "Is Griselda anywhere about\n\nI expect youd find her in the studio in the garden \u2014 sitting to\nLawrence Redding.",
    "Theres been quite a shemozzle about him said Lettice.",
    "With\nfather you know.",
    "Fathers dreadful.",
    "What was the she \u2014 whatever it was about I inquired.",
    "About his painting me.",
    "Father found out about it.",
    "Why shouldnt I\nbe painted in my bathing dress If I go on a beach in it why\nshouldnt I be painted in it\n\nLettice paused and then went on.",
    "Its really absurd \u2014 father forbidding a young man the house.",
    "Of\ncourse Lawrence and I simply shriek about it.",
    "I shall come and\nbe done here in your studio.",
    "No my dear I said.",
    "Not if your father forbids it.",
    "Oh dear said Lettice sighing.",
    "How tiresome every one is.",
    "I\nfeel shattered.",
    "Definitely.",
    "If only I had some money Id go away\nbut without it I cant.",
    "If only father would be decent and die I\nshould be all right.",
    "You must not say things like that Lettice.",
    "Well if he doesnt want me to want him to die he shouldnt be\nso horrible over money.",
    "I dont wonder mother left him.",
    "Do you\nknow for years I believed she was dead.",
    "What sort of a young\nman did she run away with Was he nice\n\nIt was before your father came to live here.",
    "I wonder whats become of her.",
    "I expect Anne will have an affair\nwith someone soon.",
    "Anne hates me \u2014 shes quite decent to me\nbut she hates me.",
    "Shes getting old and she doesnt like it.",
    "Thats\nthe age you break out you know.",
    "I wondered if Lettice was going to spend the entire afternoon in\nmy study.",
    "You havent seen my gramophone records have you she\nasked.",
    "No.",
    "How tiresome.",
    "I know Ive left them somewhere.",
    "And Ive lost\nthe dog.",
    "And my wrist watch is somewhere only it doesnt much\nmatter because it wont go.",
    "Oh dear I am so sleepy.",
    "I cant think\nwhy because I didnt get up till eleven.",
    "But lifes very shattering\ndont you think Oh dear I must go.",
    "Im going to see Dr. Stones\nbarrow at three oclock.",
    "I glanced at the clock and remarked that it was now fiveandtwenty to four.",
    "Oh is it How dreadful.",
    "I wonder if theyve waited or if theyve\ngone without me.",
    "I suppose Id better go down and do something\nabout it.",
    "She got up and drifted out again murmuring over her shoulder\n\nYoull tell Dennis wont you\n\nI said Yes mechanically only realising too late that I had no\nidea what it was I was to tell Dennis.",
    "But I reflected that in all\nprobability it did not matter.",
    "I fell to cogitating on the subject of\n\n\fDr. Stone a wellknown arch\u00e6ologist who had recently come to\nstay at the Blue Boar whilst he superintended the excavation of\na barrow situated on Colonel Protheroes property.",
    "There had\nalready been several disputes between him and the Colonel.",
    "I\nwas amused at his appointment to take Lettice to see the\noperations.",
    "It occurred to me that Lettice Protheroe was something of a\nminx.",
    "I wondered how she would get on with the arch\u00e6ologists\nsecretary Miss Cram.",
    "Miss Cram is a healthy young woman of\ntwentyfive noisy in manner with a high colour fine animal\nspirits and a mouth that always seems to have more than its full\nshare of teeth.",
    "Village opinion is divided as to whether she is no better than she\nshould be or else a young woman of iron virtue who purposes to\nbecome Mrs. Stone at an early opportunity.",
    "She is in every way a\ngreat contrast to Lettice.",
    "I could imagine that the state of things at Old Hall might not be\ntoo happy.",
    "Colonel Protheroe had married again some five years\n\n\fpreviously.",
    "The second Mrs. Protheroe was a remarkably\nhandsome woman in a rather unusual style.",
    "I had always\nguessed that the relations between her and her stepdaughter\nwere not too happy.",
    "I had one more interruption.",
    "This time it was my curate Hawes.",
    "He wanted to know the details of my interview with Protheroe.",
    "I\ntold him that the colonel had deplored his Romish tendencies\nbut that the real purpose of his visit had been on quite another\nmatter.",
    "At the same time I entered a protest of my own and told\nhim plainly that he must conform to my ruling.",
    "On the whole he\ntook my remarks very well.",
    "I felt rather remorseful when he had gone for not liking him\nbetter.",
    "These irrational likes and dislikes that one takes to\npeople are I am sure very unchristian.",
    "With a sigh I realized that the hands of the clock on my writingtable pointed to a quarter to five a sign that it was really halfpast four and I made my way to the drawingroom.",
    "Four of my parishioners were assembled there with teacups.",
    "Griselda sat behind the tea table trying to look natural in her\nenvironment but only succeeded in looking more out of place\nthan usual.",
    "I shook hands all round and sat down between Miss Marple and\nMiss Wetherby.",
    "Miss Marple is a whitehaired old lady with a gentle appealing\nmanner \u2014 Miss Wetherby is a mixture of vinegar and gush.",
    "Of\nthe two Miss Marple is much the more dangerous.",
    "We were just talking.",
    "said Griselda in a honeysweet voice\nabout Dr. Stone and Miss Cram.",
    "A ribald rhyme concocted by Dennis shot through my head.",
    "Miss Cram doesnt give a damn.",
    "I had a sudden yearning to say it out loud and observe the effect\nbut fortunately I refrained.",
    "Miss Wetherby said tersely\n\n\fNo nice girl would do it and shut her thin lips disapprovingly.",
    "Do what I inquired.",
    "Be a secretary to an unmarried man said Miss Wetherby in a\nhorrified tone.",
    "Oh my dear said Miss Marple I think married ones are the\nworst.",
    "Remember poor Mollie Carter.",
    "Married men living apart from their wives are of course\nnotorious said Miss Wetherby.",
    "And even some of the ones living with their wives murmured\nMiss Marple.",
    "I remember \u2014\n\nI interrupted these unsavoury reminiscences.",
    "But surely I said in these days a girl can take a post in just\nthe same way as a man does.",
    "To come away to the country And stay at the same hotel said\nMrs. Price Ridley in a severe voice.",
    "Miss Wetherby murmured to Miss Marple in a low voice.",
    "And all the bedrooms on the same floor . . . .\n\nMiss Hartnell who is weatherbeaten and jolly and much\ndreaded by the poor observed in a loud hearty voice\n\nThe poor man will be caught before he knows where he is.",
    "Hes\nas innocent as a babe unborn you can see that.",
    "Curious what turns of phrase we employ.",
    "None of the ladies\npresent would have dreamed of alluding to an actual baby till it\nwas safely in the cradle visible to all.",
    "Disgusting I call it continued Miss Hartnell with her usual\ntactlessness.",
    "The man must be at least twentyfive years older\nthan she is.",
    "Three female voices rose at once making disconnected remarks\nabout the Choir Boys Outing the regrettable incident at the last\nMothers Meeting and the draughts in the church.",
    "Miss Marple\ntwinkled at Griselda.",
    "Dont you think said my wife that Miss Cram may just like\nhaving an interesting job And that she considers Dr. Stone just\nas an employer.",
    "There was a silence.",
    "Evidently none of the four ladies agreed.",
    "Miss Marple broke the silence by patting Griselda on the arm.",
    "My dear she said you are very young.",
    "The young have such\ninnocent minds.",
    "Griselda said indignantly that she hadnt got at all an innocent\nmind.",
    "Naturally said Miss Marple unheeding of the protest you\nthink the best of every one.",
    "Do you really think she wants to marry that baldheaded dull\nman\n\nI understand he is quite well off said Miss Marple.",
    "Rather a\nviolent temper Im afraid.",
    "He had quite a serious quarrel with\nColonel Protheroe the other day.",
    "Every one leaned forward interestedly.",
    "Colonel Protheroe accused him of being an ignoramus.",
    "How like Colonel Protheroe and how absurd said Mrs. Price\nRidley.",
    "Very like Colonel Protheroe but I dont know about it being\nabsurd said Miss Marple.",
    "You remember the woman who\ncame down here and said she represented Welfare and after\ntaking subscriptions she was never heard of again and proved to\nhaving nothing whatever to do with Welfare.",
    "One is so inclined to\nbe trusting and take people at their own valuation.",
    "I should never have dreamed of describing Miss Marple as\ntrusting.",
    "Theres been some fuss about that young artist Mr. Redding\nhasnt there asked Miss Wetherby.",
    "Miss Marple nodded.",
    "Colonel Protheroe turned him out of the house.",
    "It appears he\nwas painting Lettice in her bathing dress.",
    "I always thought there was something between them said Mrs.\nPrice Ridley.",
    "That young fellow is always mouthing off up there.",
    "Pity the girl hasnt got a mother.",
    "A stepmother is never the same\nthing.",
    "I dare say Mrs. Protheroe does her best said Miss Hartnell.",
    "Girls are so sly deplored Mrs. Price Ridley.",
    "Quite a romance isnt it said the softerhearted Miss\nWetherby.",
    "Hes a very goodlooking young fellow.",
    "But loose said Miss Hartnell.",
    "Bound to be.",
    "An artist Paris\nModels The Altogether\n\nPainting her in her bathing dress said Mrs. Price Ridley.",
    "Not\nquite nice.",
    "Hes painting me too said Griselda.",
    "But not in your bathing dress dear said Miss Marple.",
    "It might be worse said Griselda solemnly.",
    "Naughty\n\ngirl\n\nsaid\n\nMiss\n\nHartnell\n\ntaking\n\nthe\n\njoke\n\nbroadmindedly.",
    "Everybody else looked slightly shocked.",
    "Did dear Lettice tell you of the trouble asked Miss Marple of\nme.",
    "Tell me\n\nYes.",
    "I saw her pass through the garden and go round to the\nstudy window.",
    "Miss Marple always sees everything.",
    "Gardening is as good as a\nsmoke screen and the habit of observing birds through\npowerfull glasses can always be turned to account.",
    "She mentioned it yes I admitted.",
    "Mr. Hawes looked worried said Miss Marple.",
    "I hope he hasnt\nbeen working too hard.",
    "Oh cried Miss Wetherby excitedly.",
    "I quite forgot.",
    "I knew I had\nsome news for you.",
    "I saw Dr. Haydock coming out of Mrs.\nLestranges cottage.",
    "Every one looked at each other.",
    "Perhaps shes ill suggested Mrs. Price Ridley.",
    "It must have been very sudden if so said Miss Hartnell.",
    "For I\nsaw her walking round her garden at three oclock this\nafternoon and she seemed in perfect health.",
    "She and Dr. Haydock must be old acquaintances said Mrs.\nPrice Ridley.",
    "Hes been very quiet about it.",
    "Its curious said Miss Wetherby that hes never mentioned\nit.",
    "As a matter of fact \u2014 said Griselda in a low mysterious voice\nand stopped.",
    "Every one leaned forward excitedly.",
    "I happen to know said Griselda impressively.",
    "Her husband\nwas a missionary.",
    "Terrible story.",
    "He was eaten you know.",
    "Actually eaten.",
    "And she was forced to become the chiefs head\nwife.",
    "Dr. Haydock was with an expedition and rescued her.",
    "For a moment excitement was rife then Miss Marple said\nreproachfully but with a smile Naughty girl\n\n\fShe tapped Griselda reprovingly on the arm.",
    "Very unwise thing to do my dear.",
    "If you make up these things\npeople are quite likely to believe them.",
    "And sometimes that leads\nto complications.",
    "A distinct frost had come over the assembly.",
    "Two of the ladies\nrose to take their departure.",
    "I wonder if there is anything between young Lawrence Redding\nand Lettice Protheroe said Miss Wetherby.",
    "It certainly looks\nlike it.",
    "What do you think Miss Marple\n\nMiss Marple seemed thoughtful.",
    "I shouldnt have said so myself.",
    "Not Lettice.",
    "Quite another\nperson I should have said.",
    "But Protheroe must have thought \u2014\n\n\fHe has always struck me as rather a stupid man said Miss\nMarple.",
    "The kind of man who gets the wrong idea into his head\nand is obstinate about it.",
    "Do you remember Joe Bucknell who\nused to keep the Blue Boar Such a todo about his daughter\ncarrying on with young Bailey.",
    "And all the time it was that minx of\na wife of his.",
    "She was looking full at Griselda as she spoke and I suddenly felt\na wild surge of anger.",
    "Dont you think Miss Marple I said that were an inclined to\nlet our tongues run away with us too much.",
    "Charity thinketh no\nevil you know.",
    "Inestimable harm may be done by foolish\nwagging of tongues in illnatured gossip.",
    "Dear Vicar said Miss Marple You are so unworldly.",
    "Im afraid\nthat observing human nature for as long as I have done one gets\nnot to expect very much from it.",
    "I dare say the idle tittletattle is\nvery wrong and unkind but it is so often true isnt it\n\nThat last Parthian shot went home.",
    "Chapter III\n\nNasty old cat said Griselda as soon as the door was closed.",
    "She made a face in the direction of the departing visitors and\nthen looked at me and laughed.",
    "Len do you really suspect me of having an affair with Lawrence\nRedding\n\nMy dear of course not.",
    "But you thought Miss Marple was hinting at it.",
    "And you rose to\nmy defence simply beautifully.",
    "Like \u2014 like an angry tiger.",
    "A momentary uneasiness assailed me.",
    "A clergyman of the\nChurch of England ought never to put himself in the position of\nbeing described as an angry tiger.",
    "I felt the occasion could not pass without a protest I said.",
    "But\nGriselda I wish you would be a little more careful in what you\nsay.",
    "Do you mean the cannibal story she asked.",
    "Or the\nsuggestion that Lawrence was painting me in the nude If they\nonly knew that he was painting me in a thick cloak with a very\nhigh fur collar \u2014 the sort of thing that you could go quite purely\nto see the Pope in \u2014 not a bit of sinful flesh showing anywhere\nIn fact its all marvellously pure.",
    "Lawrence never even attempts\nto make love to me \u2014 I cant think why.",
    "Surely knowing that youre a married woman \n\nDont pretend to come out of the ark Len.",
    "You know very well\nthat an attractive young woman with an elderly husband is a kind\n\n\fof gift from heaven to a young man.",
    "There must be some other\nreason \u2014 its not that Im unattractive \u2014 Im not.",
    "Surely you dont want him to make love to you\n\nNno said Griselda with more hesitation than I thought\nbecoming.",
    "If hes in love with Lettice Protheroe \u2014\n\nMiss Marple didnt seem to think he was.",
    "Miss Marple may be mistaken.",
    "She never is.",
    "That kind of old cat is always right.",
    "She paused a\nminute and then said with a quick sidelong glance at me You\ndo not believe me dont you I mean that theres nothing\nbetween Lawrence and me.",
    "My dear Griselda I said surprised.",
    "Of course.",
    "My wife came across and kissed me.",
    "I wish you werent so terribly easy to deceive Len.",
    "Youd\nbelieve me whatever I said.",
    "I should hope so.",
    "But my dear I do beg of you to guard your\ntongue and be careful what you say.",
    "These women are singularly\ndeficient in humour remember and take everything seriously.",
    "What they need said Griselda is a little immorality in their\nlives.",
    "Then they wouldnt be so busy looking for it in other\npeoples.",
    "And on this she left the room and glancing at my watch I hurried\nout to pay some visits that ought to have been made earlier in\nthe day.",
    "The Wednesday evening service was sparsely attended as\nusual but when I came out through the church after disrobing in\nthe vestry it was empty save for a woman who stood staring up\nat one of our windows.",
    "We have some rather fine old stained\n\n\fglass and indeed the church itself is well worth looking at.",
    "She\nturned at my footsteps and I saw that it was Mrs. Lestrange.",
    "We both hesitated a moment and then I said\n\nI hope you like our little church.",
    "Ive been admiring the screen she said.",
    "Her voice was pleasant low yet very distinct with a clearcut\nenunciation.",
    "She added\n\nIm so sorry to have missed your wife yesterday.",
    "We talked a few minutes longer about the church.",
    "She was\nevidently a cultured woman who knew something of Church\nhistory and architecture.",
    "We left the building together and\nwalked down the road since one way to the Vicarage led past\nher house.",
    "As we arrived at the gate she said pleasantly\n\n\fCome in wont you And tell me what you think of what I have\ndone.",
    "I accepted the invitation.",
    "Little Gates had formerly belonged to\nan AngloIndian colonel and I could not help feeling relieved by\nthe disappearance of the brass tables and Burmese idols.",
    "It was\nfurnished now very simply but in exquisite taste.",
    "There was a\nsense of harmony and rest about it.",
    "Yet I wondered more and more what had brought such a woman\nas Mrs. Lestrange to St. Mary Mead.",
    "She was so very clearly a\nwoman of the world that it seemed a strange taste to bury\nherself in a country village.",
    "In the clear light of her drawingroom I had an opportunity of\nobserving her closely for the first time.",
    "She was a very tall woman.",
    "Her hair was gold with a tinge of red\nin it.",
    "Her eyebrows and eyelashes were dark whether by art or\nby nature I could not decide.",
    "If she was as I thought made up it\nwas done very artistically.",
    "There was something Sphinxlike\n\n\fabout her face when it was in repose and she had the most\ncurious eyes I have ever seen \u2014 they were almost golden in\nshade.",
    "Her clothes were perfect and she had all the ease of manner of a\nwellbred woman and yet there was something about her that\nwas incongruous and baffling.",
    "You felt that she was a mystery.",
    "The word Griselda had used occurred to me \u2014 sinister.",
    "Absurd\nof course and yet \u2014 was it so absurd The thought sprang\nunbidden into my mind This woman would stick at nothing.",
    "Our talk was on most normal lines \u2014 pictures books old\nchurches.",
    "Yet somehow I got very strongly the impression that\nthere was something else \u2014 something of quite a different\nnature that Mrs. Lestrange wanted to say to me.",
    "I caught her eyes on me once or twice looking at me with a\ncurious hesitancy as though she were unable to make up her\nmind.",
    "She kept the talk I noticed strictly to impersonal subjects.",
    "She made no mention of a husband or of friends or relations.",
    "But all the time there was that strange urgent appeal in her\nglance.",
    "It seemed to say Shall I tell you I want to.",
    "Cant you\nhelp me\n\nYet in the end it died away \u2014 or perhaps it had all been my fancy.",
    "I had the feeling that I was being dismissed.",
    "I rose and took my\nleave.",
    "As I went out of the room I glanced back and saw her\nstaring after me with a puzzled doubtful expression.",
    "On an\nimpulse I came back\n\nIf there is anything I can do \u2014\n\nShe said doubtfully Its very kind of you \u2014\n\nWe were both silent.",
    "Then she said\n\nI wish I knew.",
    "Its very difficult.",
    "No I dont think any one can\nhelp me.",
    "But thank you for offering to do so.",
    "That seemed final so I went.",
    "But as I did so I wondered.",
    "We are\nnot used to mysteries in St. Mary Mead.",
    "So much is this the case that as I emerged from the gate I was\npounced upon.",
    "Miss Hartnell is very good at pouncing in a heavy\nand cumbrous way.",
    "I saw you she exclaimed with ponderous humour.",
    "And I was\nso excited.",
    "Now can you tell us all about it.",
    "About what\n\nThe mysterious lady Is she a widow or has she a husband\nsomewhere\n\nI really couldnt say.",
    "She didnt tell me.",
    "How very peculiar.",
    "One would think she would be certain to\nmention something casually.",
    "It almost looks doesnt it as\nthough she had a reason for not speaking\n\nI really dont see that.",
    "Ah but as dear Miss Marple says you are so unworldly dear\nvicar.",
    "Tell me has she known Dr. Haydock long\n\nShe didnt mention him so I dont know.",
    "Really But what did you talk about then\n\nPictures music books I said truthfully.",
    "Miss Hartnell whose only topics of conversation are the purely\npersonal looked suspicious and unbelieving.",
    "Taking advantage\nof a momentary hesitation on her part as to how to proceed next\nI bade her goodnight and walked rapidly away.",
    "I called in at a house farther down the village and returned to the\nVicarage by the garden gate passing as I did so the danger\npoint of Miss Marples garden.",
    "However I did not see how it was\nhumanly possible for the news of my visit to Mrs. Lestrange to\nhave yet reached her ears so I felt reasonably safe.",
    "As I latched the gate it occurred to me that I would just step\ndown to the shed in the garden which young Lawrence Redding\nwas using as a studio and see for myself how Griseldas portrait\nwas progressing.",
    "I append a rough sketch here which will be useful in the light of\nafter happenings only sketching in such details as are\nnecessary.",
    "PLAN A\n\nI had no idea there was any one in the studio.",
    "There had been no\nvoices from within to warn me and I suppose that my own\nfootsteps made no noise upon the grass.",
    "I opened the door and then stopped awkwardly on the threshold.",
    "For there were two people in the studio and the mans arms\nwere round the woman and he was kissing her passionately.",
    "The two people were the artist Lawrence Redding and Mrs.\nProtheroe.",
    "I backed out precipitately and beat a retreat to my study.",
    "There I\nsat down in a chair took out my pipe and thought things over.",
    "The discovery had come as a great shock to me.",
    "Especially\nsince my conversation with Lettice that afternoon I had felt fairly\ncertain that there was some kind of understanding growing up\nbetween her and the young man.",
    "Moreover I was convinced that\nshe herself thought so.",
    "I felt positive that she had no idea of the\nartists feelings for her stepmother.",
    "A nasty tangle.",
    "I paid a grudging tribute to Miss Marple.",
    "She had\nnot been deceived but had evidently suspected the true state of\nthings with a fair amount of accuracy.",
    "I had entirely misread her\nmeaning glance at Griselda.",
    "I had never dreamed of considering Mrs. Protheroe in the\nmatter.",
    "There has always been rather a suggestion of C\u00e6sars\nwife about Mrs. Protheroe \u2014 a quiet selfcontained woman\nwhom one would not suspect of any great depths of feeling.",
    "I had got to this point in my meditations when a tap on my study\nwindow aroused me.",
    "I got up and went to it.",
    "Mrs. Protheroe was\nstanding outside.",
    "I opened the window and she came in not\nwaiting for an invitation on my part.",
    "She crossed the room in a\nbreathless sort of way and dropped down on the sofa.",
    "I had the feeling that I had never really seen her before.",
    "The\nquiet selfcontained woman that I knew had vanished.",
    "In her\nplace was a quickbreathing desperate creature.",
    "For the first\ntime I realised that Anne Protheroe was beautiful.",
    "She was a brownhaired woman with a pale face and very deep\nset grey eyes.",
    "She was flushed now and her breast heaved.",
    "It\nwas as though a statue had suddenly come to life.",
    "I blinked my\neyes at the transformation.",
    "I thought it best to come she said.",
    "You \u2014 you saw just now\nI bowed my head.",
    "She said very quietly We love each other .",
    ". .\n\nAnd even in the middle of her evident distress and agitation she\ncould not keep a little smile from her lips.",
    "The smile of a woman\nwho sees something very beautiful and wonderful.",
    "I still said nothing and she added presently\n\nI suppose to you that seems very wrong\n\nCan you expect me to say anything else Mrs. Protheroe\n\nNo \u2014 no I suppose not.",
    "I went on trying to make my voice as gentle as possible\n\nYou are a married woman \u2014\n\n\fShe interrupted me.",
    "Oh I know \u2014 I know.",
    "Do you think I havent gone over all that\nagain and again Im not a bad woman really \u2014 Im not.",
    "And\nthings arent \u2014 arent \u2014 as you might think they are.",
    "I said gravely Im glad of that.",
    "She asked rather timorously\n\nAre you going to tell my husband\n\nI said rather dryly\n\nThere seems to be a general idea that a clergyman is incapable\nof behaving like a gentleman.",
    "That is not true.",
    "She threw me a grateful glance.",
    "Im so unhappy.",
    "Oh Im so dreadfully unhappy.",
    "I cant go on.",
    "I\nsimply cant go on.",
    "And I dont know what to do.",
    "Her voice rose\n\n\fwith a slightly hysterical note in it.",
    "You dont know what my life\nis like.",
    "Ive been miserable with Lucius from the beginning.",
    "No\nwoman could be happy with him.",
    "I wish he were dead .",
    ". . Its\nawful but I do .",
    ". . Im desperate.",
    "I tell you Im desperate.",
    "She\nstarted and looked over at the window.",
    "What was that I thought I heard someone Perhaps its\nLawrence.",
    "I went over to the window which I had not closed as I had\nthought.",
    "I stepped out and looked down the garden but there\nwas no one in sight.",
    "Yet I was almost convinced that I too had\nheard someone.",
    "Or perhaps it was her certainty that had\nconvinced me.",
    "When I reentered the room she was leaning forward drooping\nher head down.",
    "She looked the picture of despair.",
    "She said\nagain\n\nI dont know what to do.",
    "I dont know what to do.",
    "I came and sat down beside her.",
    "I said the things I thought it was\nmy duty to say and tried to say them with the necessary\nconviction uneasily conscious all the time that that same\nmorning I had given voice to the sentiment that a world without\nColonel Protheroe in it would be improved for the better.",
    "Above all I begged her to do nothing rash.",
    "To leave her home\nand her husband was a very serious step.",
    "I dont suppose I convinced her.",
    "I have lived long enough in the\nworld to know that arguing with any one in love is next door to\nuseless but I do think my words brought to her some measure of\ncomfort.",
    "When she rose to go she thanked me and promised to think\nover what I had said.",
    "Nevertheless when she had gone I felt very uneasy.",
    "I felt that\nhitherto I had misjudged Anne Protheroes character.",
    "She\nimpressed me now as a very desperate woman the kind of\nwoman who would stick at nothing once her emotions were\n\n\faroused.",
    "And she was desperately wildly madly in love with\nLawrence Redding a man several years younger than herself.",
    "I\ndidnt like it.",
    "Chapter IV\n\nI had entirely forgotten that we had asked Lawrence Redding to\ndinner that night.",
    "When Griselda burst in and scolded me\npointing out that it lacked two minutes to dinner time I was quite\ntaken aback.",
    "I hope everything will be all right Griselda called up the stairs\nafter me.",
    "Ive thought over what you said at lunch and Ive\nreally thought of some quite good things to eat.",
    "I may say in passing that our evening meal amply bore out\nGriseldas assertion that things went much worse when she tried\nthan when she didnt.",
    "The menu was ambitious in conception\nand Mary seemed to have taken a perverse pleasure in seeing\nhow best she could alternate undercooking and overcooking.",
    "Some oysters which Griselda had ordered and which would\nseem to be beyond the reach of incompetence we were\nunfortunately not able to sample as we had nothing in the house\nto open them with \u2014 an omission which was discovered only\nwhen the moment for eating them arrived.",
    "I had rather doubted whether Lawrence Redding would put in an\nappearance.",
    "He might very easily have sent an excuse.",
    "However he arrived punctually enough and the four of us went\nin to dinner.",
    "Lawrence Redding has an undeniably attractive personality.",
    "He\nis I suppose about thirty years of age.",
    "He has dark hair but his\neyes are of a brilliant almost startling blue.",
    "He is the kind of\nyoung man who does everything well.",
    "He is good at games an\n\n\fexcellent shot a good amateur actor and can tell a firstrate\nstory.",
    "He is capable of making any party go.",
    "He has I think Irish\nblood in his veins.",
    "He is not at all ones idea of the typical artist.",
    "Yet I believe he is a clever painter in the modern style.",
    "I know\nvery little of painting myself.",
    "It was only natural that on this particular evening he should\nappear a shade distrait.",
    "On the whole he carried off things very\nwell.",
    "I dont think Griselda or Dennis noticed anything wrong.",
    "Probably I should not have noticed anything myself if I had not\nknown beforehand.",
    "Griselda and Dennis were particularly gay \u2014 full of jokes about\nDr. Stone and Miss Cram \u2014 the Local Scandal It suddenly came\nhome to me with something of a pang that Dennis is nearer\nGriseldas age than I am.",
    "He calls me Uncle Len but her\nGriselda.",
    "It gave me somehow a lonely feeling.",
    "I must I think have been upset by Mrs. Protheroe.",
    "Im not\nusually given to such unprofitable reflections.",
    "Griselda and Dennis went rather far now and then but I hadnt\nthe heart to check them.",
    "I have always thought it a pity that the\nmere presence of a clergyman should have a damping effect.",
    "Lawrence took a gay part in the conversation.",
    "Nevertheless I\nwas aware of his eyes continually straying to where I sat and I\nwas not surprised when after dinner he man\u0153uvred to get me\ninto the study.",
    "As soon as we were alone his manner changed.",
    "Youve surprised our secret sir he said.",
    "What are you going\nto do about it\n\nI could speak far more plainly to Redding than I could to Mrs.\nProtheroe and I did so.",
    "He took it very well.",
    "Of course he said when I had finished youre bound to say\nall this.",
    "Youre a parson.",
    "I dont mean that in any way offensively.",
    "As a matter of fact I think youre probably right.",
    "But this isnt the\nusual sort of thing between Anne and me.",
    "I told him that people had been saying that particular phrase\nsince the dawn of time and a queer little smile creased his lips.",
    "You mean every one thinks their case is unique Perhaps so.",
    "But one thing you must believe.",
    "He assured me that so far \u2014 there was nothing wrong in it.",
    "Anne he said was one of the truest and most loyal women that\never lived.",
    "What was going to happen he didnt know.",
    "If this were only a book he said gloomily the old man would\ndie \u2014 and a good riddance to everybody.",
    "I reproved him\n\nOh I didnt mean I was going to stick him in the back with a\nknife though Id offer my best thanks to anyone else who did so.",
    "Theres not a soul in the world whos got a good word to say for\nhim.",
    "I rather wonder the first Mrs. Protheroe didnt do him in.",
    "I\nmet her once years ago and she looked quite capable of it.",
    "One\n\n\fof those calm dangerous women.",
    "He goes blustering along\nstirring up trouble everywhere mean as the devil and with a\nparticularly nasty temper.",
    "You dont know what Anne has had to\nstand from him.",
    "If I had a penny in the world Id take her away\nwithout any more ado.",
    "Then I spoke to him very earnestly.",
    "I begged him to leave St.\nMary Mead.",
    "By remaining there he could only bring greater\nunhappiness on Anne Protheroe than was already her lot.",
    "People\nwould talk the matter would get to Colonel Protheroes ears \u2014\nand things would be made infinitely worse for her.",
    "Lawrence protested.",
    "Nobody knows a thing about it except you padre.",
    "My dear young man you underestimate the detective instinct of\nvillage life.",
    "In St. Mary Mead every one knows your most intimate\naffairs.",
    "There is no detective in England equal to a spinster lady\nof uncertain age with plenty of time on her hands.",
    "He said easily that that was all right.",
    "Every one thought it was\nLettice.",
    "Has it occurred to you I asked that possibly Lettice might\nthink so herself.",
    "He seemed quite surprised by the idea.",
    "Lettice he said didnt\ncare a hang about him.",
    "He was sure of that.",
    "Shes a queer sort of girl he said.",
    "Always seems in a kind of\ndream and yet underneath I believe shes really rather practical.",
    "I believe all that vague stuff is a pose.",
    "Lettice knows jolly well\nwhat shes doing.",
    "And theres a funny vindictive streak in her.",
    "The queer thing is that she hates Anne.",
    "Simply loathes her.",
    "And\nyet Annes been a perfect angel to her always.",
    "I did not of course take his word for this last.",
    "To infatuated\nyoung men their inamorata always behaves like an angel.",
    "Still\nto the best of my observation Anne had always behaved to her\nstepdaughter with kindness and fairness.",
    "I had been surprised\nmyself that afternoon at the bitterness of Lettices tone.",
    "We had to leave the conversation there because Griselda and\nDennis burst in upon us and said I was not to make Lawrence\nbehave like an old fogy.",
    "Oh dear said Griselda throwing herself into an armchair.",
    "How I would like a thrill of some kind.",
    "A murder \u2014 or even a\nburglary.",
    "I dont suppose theres any one much worth burgling said\nLawrence trying to enter into her mood.",
    "Unless we stole Miss\nHartnells false teeth.",
    "They do click horribly said Griselda.",
    "But youre wrong about\nthere being no one worth while.",
    "Theres some marvellous old\nsilver at Old Hall.",
    "Trencher salts and a Charles II.",
    "Tazza \u2014 all\nkinds of things like that.",
    "Worth thousands of pounds I believe.",
    "The old man would probably shoot you with an army revolver\nsaid Dennis.",
    "Just the sort of thing hed enjoy doing.",
    "Oh wed get in first and hold him up said Griselda.",
    "Whos got\na revolver\n\nIve got a Mauser pistol said Lawrence.",
    "Have you How exciting.",
    "Why do you have it\n\nSouvenir of the war said Lawrence briefly.",
    "Old Protheroe was showing the silver to Stone today\nvolunteered Dennis.",
    "Old Stone was pretending to be no end\ninterested in it.",
    "I thought theyd quarrelled about the barrow said Griselda.",
    "Oh theyve made that up said Dennis.",
    "I cant think what\npeople want to grub about in barrows for anyway.",
    "That man Stone puzzles me said Lawrence.",
    "I think he must\nbe very absentminded.",
    "Youd swear sometimes he knew nothing\nabout his own subject.",
    "Thats love said Dennis.",
    "Sweet Gladys Cram you are no\nsham.",
    "Your teeth are white and fill me with delight.",
    "Come fly with\nme my bride to be.",
    "And at the Blue Boar on the bedroom floor\n\u2014\n\nThats enough Dennis I said.",
    "Well said Lawrence Redding I must be off.",
    "Thank you very\nmuch Mrs. Clement for a very pleasant evening.",
    "Griselda and Dennis saw him off.",
    "Dennis returned to the study\nalone.",
    "Something had happened to ruffle the boy.",
    "He wandered\nabout the room aimlessly frowning and kicking the furniture.",
    "Our furniture is so shabby already that it can hardly be damaged\nfurther but I felt impelled to utter a mild protest.",
    "Sorry said Dennis.",
    "He was silent for a moment and then burst out\n\nWhat an absolutely rotten thing gossip is\n\nI was a little surprised.",
    "Whats the matter I asked.",
    "I dont know whether I ought to tell you.",
    "I was more and more surprised.",
    "Its such an absolutely rotten thing Dennis said again.",
    "Going\nround and saying things.",
    "Not even saying them.",
    "Hinting them.",
    "No Im damned \u2014 sorry \u2014 if I tell you Its too absolutely rotten.",
    "I looked at him curiously but I did not press him further.",
    "I\nwondered very much though.",
    "It is very unlike Dennis to take\nanything to heart.",
    "Griselda came in at that moment.",
    "Miss Wetherbys just rung up she said.",
    "Mrs. Lestrange went\nout at a quarterpast eight and hasnt come in yet.",
    "Nobody\nknows where shes gone.",
    "Why should they know\n\nBut it isnt to Dr. Haydocks.",
    "Miss Wetherby does know that\nbecause she telephoned to Miss Hartnell who lives next door to\nhim and who would have been sure to see her.",
    "It is a mystery to me I said how any one ever gets any\nnourishment in this place.",
    "They must eat their meals standing up\nby the window so as to be sure of not missing anything.",
    "And thats not all said Griselda bubbling with pleasure.",
    "Theyve found out about the Blue Boar.",
    "Dr. Stone and Miss\nCram have got rooms next door to each other BUT \u2014 she\nwaved an impressive forefinger \u2014 no communicating door\n\nThat I said must be very disappointing to everybody.",
    "At which Griselda laughed.",
    "Thursday started badly.",
    "Two of the ladies of my parish elected to\nquarrel about the church decorations.",
    "I was called in to\nadjudicate between two middleaged ladies each of whom was\nliterally trembling with rage.",
    "If it had not been so painful it would\nhave been quite an interesting physical phenomenon.",
    "Then I had to reprove two of our choir boys for persistent sweet\nsucking during the hours of divine service and I had an uneasy\nfeeling that I was not doing the job as wholeheartedly as I should\nhave done.",
    "Then our organist who is distinctly touchy had taken offence\nand had to be smoothed down.",
    "And four of my poorer parishioners declared open rebellion\nagainst Miss Hartnell who came to me bursting with rage about\nit.",
    "I was just going home when I met Colonel Protheroe.",
    "He was in\nhigh goodhumour having sentenced three poachers in his\ncapacity as magistrate.",
    "Firmness he shouted in his stentorian voice.",
    "He is slightly deaf\nand raises his voice accordingly as deaf people often do.",
    "Thats\nwhats needed nowadays \u2014 firmness Make an example.",
    "That\nrogue Archer came out yesterday and is vowing vengeance\nagainst me I hear.",
    "Impudent scoundrel.",
    "Threatened men live\nlong as the saying goes.",
    "Ill show him what his vengeance is\nworth next time I catch him taking my pheasants.",
    "Lax Were too\nlax nowadays I believe in showing a man up for what he is.",
    "Youre always being asked to consider a mans wife and\nchildren.",
    "Damned nonsense.",
    "Fiddlesticks.",
    "Why should a man\nescape the consequences of his acts just because he whines\nabout his wife and children Its all the same to me \u2014 no matter\nwhat a man is \u2014 doctor lawyer clergyman poacher drunken\nwastrel \u2014 if you catch him on the wrong side of the law let the\nlaw punish him.",
    "You agree with me Im sure.",
    "You forget I said.",
    "My calling obliges me to respect one quality\nabove all others \u2014 the quality of mercy.",
    "Well Im a just man.",
    "No one can deny that.",
    "I did not speak and he said sharply\n\nWhy dont you answer A penny for your thoughts man.",
    "I hesitated then I decided to speak.",
    "I was thinking I said that when my time comes I should be\nsorry if the only plea I had to offer was that of justice.",
    "Because it\nmight mean that only justice would be meted out to me .",
    ". .\n\nPah What we need is a little militant Christianity.",
    "Ive always\ndone my duty I hope.",
    "Well no more of that.",
    "Ill be along this\nevening as I said.",
    "Well make it a quarterpast six instead of six\nif you dont mind.",
    "Ive got to see a man in the village.",
    "That will suit me quite well.",
    "He flourished his stick and strode away.",
    "Turning I ran into\nHawes.",
    "I thought he looked distinctly ill this morning.",
    "I had\nmeant to upbraid him mildly for various matters in his province\nwhich had been muddled or shelved but seeing his white\nstrained face I felt that the man was ill.",
    "I said as much and he denied it but not very vehemently.",
    "Finally\nhe confessed that he was not feeling too fit and appeared ready\nto accept my advice of going home to bed.",
    "I had a hurried lunch and went out to do some visits.",
    "Griselda\nhad gone to London by the cheap Thursday train.",
    "I came in about a quarter to four with the intention of sketching\nthe outline of my Sunday sermon but Mary told me that Mr.\nRedding was waiting for me in the study.",
    "I found him pacing up and down with a worried face.",
    "He looked\nwhite and haggard.",
    "He turned abruptly at my entrance.",
    "Look here sir.",
    "Ive been thinking over what you said yesterday.",
    "Ive had a sleepless night thinking about it.",
    "Youre right.",
    "Ive got\nto cut and run.",
    "My dear boy I said.",
    "You were right in what you said about Anne.",
    "Ill only bring\ntrouble on her by staying here.",
    "Shes \u2014 shes too good for\nanything else.",
    "I see Ive got to go.",
    "Ive made things hard enough\nfor her as it is Heaven help me.",
    "I think you have made the only decision possible I said.",
    "I\nknow that it is a hard one but believe me it will be for the best in\nthe end.",
    "I could see that he thought that that was the kind of thing easily\nsaid by someone who didnt know what he was talking about.",
    "Youll look after Anne She needs a friend.",
    "You can rest assured that I will do everything in my power.",
    "Thank you sir.",
    "He wrung my hand.",
    "Youre a good sort Padre.",
    "I shall see her to say goodbye this evening and I shall probably\npack up and go tomorrow.",
    "No good prolonging the agony.",
    "Thanks for letting me have the shed to paint in.",
    "Im sorry not to\nhave finished Mrs. Clements portrait.",
    "Dont worry about that my dear boy.",
    "Goodbye and God bless\nyou.",
    "When he had gone I tried to settle down to my sermon but with\nvery poor success.",
    "I kept thinking of Lawrence and Anne\nProtheroe.",
    "I had rather an unpalatable cup of tea cold and black and at\nhalfpast five the telephone rang.",
    "I was informed that Mr. Abbott\nof Lower Farm was dying and would I please come at once.",
    "I rang up Old Hall immediately for Lower Farm was nearly two\nmiles away and I could not possibly get back by sixfifteen.",
    "I have\nnever succeeded in learning to ride a bicycle.",
    "I was told however that Colonel Protheroe had just started out\nin the car so I departed leaving word With Mary that I had been\ncalled away but would try to be back by sixthirty or soon after.",
    "Chapter V\n\nIt was nearer seven than halfpast six when I approached the\nVicarage gate on my return.",
    "Before I reached it it swung open\nand Lawrence Redding came out.",
    "He stopped dead on seeing\nme and I was immediately struck by his appearance.",
    "He looked\nlike a man who was on the point of going mad.",
    "His eyes stared in\n\n\fa peculiar manner he was deathly white and he was shaking\nand twitching all over.",
    "I wondered for a moment whether he could have been drinking\nbut repudiated the idea immediately\n\nHullo I said have you been to see me again Sorry I was out.",
    "Come back now.",
    "Ive got to see Protheroe about some accounts\n\u2014 but I dare say we shant be long.",
    "Protheroe he said.",
    "He began to laugh.",
    "Protheroe Youre\ngoing to see Protheroe Oh youll see Protheroe all right.",
    "Oh\nmy God \u2014 yes.",
    "I stared.",
    "Instinctively I stretched out a hand towards him.",
    "He\ndrew sharply aside.",
    "No he almost cried out.",
    "Ive got to get away \u2014 to think.",
    "Ive\ngot to think.",
    "I must think.",
    "He broke into a run and vanished rapidly down the road towards\nthe village leaving me staring after him my first idea of\ndrunkenness recurring.",
    "Finally I shook my head and went on to the Vicarage.",
    "The front\ndoor is always left open but nevertheless I rang the bell.",
    "Mary\ncame wiping her hands on her apron.",
    "So youre back at last she observed.",
    "Is Colonel Protheroe here I asked.",
    "In the study.",
    "Been here since a quarter past six.",
    "And Mr. Reddings been here\n\nCome a few minutes ago.",
    "Asked for you.",
    "I told him youd be\nback any minute and that Colonel Protheroe was waiting in the\nstudy and he said hed wait too and went there.",
    "Hes there\nnow.",
    "No he isnt I said.",
    "Ive just met him going down the road.",
    "Well I didnt hear him leave.",
    "He cant have stayed more than a\ncouple of minutes.",
    "The mistress isnt back from town yet.",
    "I nodded absentmindedly.",
    "Mary beat a retreat to the kitchen\nquarters and I went down the passage and opened the study\ndoor.",
    "After the dusk of the passage the evening sunshine that was\npouring into the room made my eyes blink.",
    "I took a step or two\nacross the floor and then stopped dead.",
    "For a moment I could hardly take in the meaning of the scene\nbefore me.",
    "Colonel Protheroe was lying sprawled across my writing table in\na horrible unnatural position.",
    "There was a pool of some dark\nfluid on the desk by his head and it was slowly dripping on to the\nfloor with a horrible drip drip drip.",
    "I pulled myself together and went across to him.",
    "His skin was\ncold to the touch.",
    "The hand that I raised fell back lifeless.",
    "The\nman was dead \u2014 shot through the head.",
    "I went to the door and called Mary.",
    "When she came I ordered her\nto run as fast as she could and fetch Dr. Haydock who lives just\nat the corner of the road.",
    "I told her there had been an accident.",
    "Then I went back and closed the door to await the doctors\ncoming.",
    "Fortunately Mary found him at home.",
    "Haydock is a good fellow\na big fine strapping man with an honest rugged face.",
    "His eyebrows went up when I pointed silently across the room.",
    "But like a true doctor he showed no signs of emotion.",
    "He bent\nover the dead man examining him rapidly.",
    "Then he straightened\nhimself and looked across at me.",
    "Well I asked.",
    "Hes dead right enough \u2014 been dead half an hour I should\nsay.",
    "Suicide\n\nOut of the question man.",
    "Look at the position of the wound.",
    "Besides if he shot himself wheres the weapon\n\nTrue enough there was no sign of any such thing.",
    "Wed better not mess around with anything said Haydock.",
    "Id\nbetter ring up the police.",
    "He picked up the receiver and spoke into it.",
    "He gave the facts as\ncurtly as possible and then replaced the telephone and came\nacross to where I was sitting.",
    "This is a rotten business.",
    "How did you come to find him\n\nI explained.",
    "Is \u2014 is it murder I asked rather faintly.",
    "Looks like it.",
    "Mean to say what else can it be Extraordinary\nbusiness.",
    "Wonder who had a down on the poor old fellow.",
    "Of\ncourse I know he wasnt popular but one isnt often murdered\nfor that reason \u2014 worse luck.",
    "Theres one rather curious thing I said.",
    "I was telephoned for\nthis afternoon to go to a dying parishioner.",
    "When I got there\nevery one was very surprised to see me.",
    "The sick man was very\nmuch better than he had been for some days and his wife flatly\ndenied telephoning for me at all.",
    "Haydock drew his brows together.",
    "Thats suggestive \u2014 very.",
    "You were being got out of the way.",
    "Wheres your wife\n\nGone up to London for the day.",
    "And the maid\n\nIn the kitchen \u2014 right at the other side of the house.",
    "Where she wouldnt be likely to hear anything that went on in\nhere.",
    "Its a nasty business.",
    "Who knew that Protheroe was\ncoming here this evening\n\nHe referred to the fact this morning in the village street at the\ntop of his voice as usual.",
    "Meaning that the whole village knew it Which they always do in\nany case.",
    "Know of any one who had a grudge against him \n\nThe thought of Lawrence Reddings white face and staring eyes\ncame to my mind.",
    "I was spared answering by a noise of shuffling\nfeet in the passage outside.",
    "The police said my friend and rose to his feet.",
    "Our police force were represented by Constable Hurst looking\nvery important but slightly worried.",
    "Goodevening gentlemen he greeted us.",
    "The Inspector will\nbe here any minute.",
    "In the meantime Ill follow out his\ninstructions.",
    "I understand Colonel Protheroes been found shot\n\u2014 in the Vicarage.",
    "He paused and directed a look of cold suspicion at me which I\ntried to meet with a suitable bearing of conscious innocence.",
    "He moved over to the writing table and announced\n\nNothing to be touched until the Inspector comes.",
    "For the convenience of my readers I append a sketch plan of the\nroom.",
    "PLAN B\n\n\fHe got out his notebook moistened his pencil and looked\nexpectantly at both of us.",
    "I repeated my story of discovering the body.",
    "When he had got it\nall down which took some time he turned to the doctor.",
    "In your opinion Dr. Haydock what was the cause of death\n\nShot through the head at close quarters.",
    "And the weapon\n\nI cant say with certainty until we get the bullet out.",
    "But I should\nsay in all probability the bullet was fired from a pistol of small\ncalibre \u2014 say a Mauser .25.",
    "I started remembering our conversation of the night before and\nLawrence Reddings admission.",
    "The police constable brought\nhis cold fishlike eye round on me.",
    "Did you speak sir\n\n\fI shook my head.",
    "Whatever suspicions I might have they were\nno more than suspicions and as such to be kept to myself.",
    "When in your opinion did the tragedy occur\n\nThe doctor hesitated for a minute before he answered.",
    "Then he\nsaid\n\nThe man has been dead just over half an hour I should say.",
    "Certainly not longer.",
    "Hurst turned to me.",
    "Did the girl hear anything\n\nAs far as I know she heard nothing I said.",
    "But you bad better\nask her.",
    "But at this moment Inspector Slack arrived having come by car\nfrom Much Benham two miles away.",
    "All that I can say of Inspector Slack is that never did a man more\ndeterminedly strive to contradict his name.",
    "He was a dark man\nrestless and energetic in manner with black eyes that snapped\nceaselessly.",
    "His manner was rude and overbearing in the\nextreme.",
    "He acknowledged our greetings with a curt nod seized his\nsubordinates notebook perused it exchanged a few curt words\nwith him in an undertone then strode over to the body.",
    "Everythings been messed up and pulled about I suppose he\nsaid.",
    "Ive touched nothing said Haydock.",
    "No more have I I said.",
    "The Inspector busied himself for some time peering at the things\non the table and examining the pool of blood.",
    "Ah he said in a tone of triumph.",
    "Heres what we want.",
    "Clock\noverturned when he fell forward.",
    "Thatll give us the time of the\ncrime.",
    "Twentytwo minutes past six.",
    "What time did you say death\noccurred doctor\n\nI said about half an hour but \u2014\n\nThe Inspector consulted his watch.",
    "Five minutes past seven.",
    "I got word about ten minutes ago at\nfive minutes to seven.",
    "Discovery of the body was at about a\nquarter to seven.",
    "I understand you were fetched immediately.",
    "Say you examined it at ten minutes to \u2014 Why that brings it to the\nidentical second almost\n\nI dont guarantee the time absolutely said Haydock.",
    "That is\nan approximate estimate.",
    "Good enough sir good enough.",
    "I had been trying to get a word in.",
    "About that clock \u2014\n\nIf youll excuse me sir Ill ask you any questions I want to know.",
    "Times short.",
    "What I want is absolute silence.",
    "Yes but Id like to tell you \u2014\n\nAbsolute silence said the Inspector glaring at me ferociously.",
    "I gave him what he asked for.",
    "He was still peering about the writing table.",
    "What was he sitting here for he grunted.",
    "Did he want to write\na note \u2014 Hallo \u2014 whats this\n\nHe held up a piece of notepaper triumphantly.",
    "So pleased was\nhe with his find that he permitted us to come to his side and\nexamine it with him.",
    "It was a piece of Vicarage notepaper and it was headed at the\ntop 6.20.",
    "DEAR CLEMENT \u2014 it began \u2014 Sorry I cannot wait any longer\nbut I must .",
    ". .",
    "Here the writing tailed off in a scrawl\n\nPlain as a pikestaff said Inspector Slack triumphantly.",
    "He sits\ndown here to write this an enemy comes softly in through the\nwindow and shoots him as he writes.",
    "What more do you want\n\nId just like to say \u2014 I began.",
    "Out of the way if you please sir.",
    "I want to see if there are\nfootprints.",
    "He went down on his hands and knees moving towards the open\nwindow.",
    "I think you ought to know \u2014 I said obstinately.",
    "The Inspector rose.",
    "He spoke without heat but firmly.",
    "Well go into all that later.",
    "Id be obliged if you gentlemen will\nclear out of here.",
    "Right out if you please.",
    "We permitted ourselves to be shooed out like children.",
    "Hours seemed to have passed \u2014 yet it was only a quarterpast\nseven.",
    "Well said Haydock.",
    "Thats that.",
    "When that conceited ass\nwants me you can send him over to the surgery.",
    "So long.",
    "The mistress is back said Mary making a brief appearance\nfrom the kitchen.",
    "Her eyes were round and agog with\nexcitement.",
    "Come in about five minutes ago.",
    "I found Griselda in the drawingroom.",
    "She looked frightened but\nexcited.",
    "I told her everything and she listened attentively.",
    "The letter is headed 6.20 I ended.",
    "And the clock fell over and\nhas stopped at 6.22.",
    "Yes said Griselda.",
    "But that clock didnt you tell him that it\nwas always kept a quarter of an hour fast\n\nNo I said.",
    "I didnt.",
    "He wouldnt let me.",
    "I tried my best.",
    "Griselda was frowning in a puzzled manner.",
    "But Len she said that makes the whole thing perfectly\nextraordinary.",
    "Because when that clock said twenty past six it\nwas really only five minutes past and at five minutes past I dont\nsuppose Colonel Protheroe had even arrived at the house.",
    "Chapter VI\n\nWe puzzled over the business of the clock for some time but we\ncould make nothing of it.",
    "Griselda said I ought to make another\neffort to tell Inspector Slack about it but on that point I was\nfeeling what I can only describe as mulish.",
    "Inspector Slack had been abominably and most unnecessarily\nrude.",
    "I was looking forward to a moment when I could produce\nmy valuable contribution and effect his discomfiture.",
    "I would\nthen say in a tone of mild reproach\n\nIf you had only listened to me Inspector Slack \u2014\n\nI expected that he would at least speak to me before he left the\nhouse but to our surprise we learned from Mary that he had\n\n\fdeparted having locked up the study door and issued orders\nthat no one was to attempt to enter the room.",
    "Griselda suggested going up to Old Hall.",
    "It will be so awful for Anne Protheroe \u2014 with the police and\neverything she said.",
    "Perhaps I might be able to do something\nfor her.",
    "I cordially approved of this plan and Griselda set off with\ninstructions that she was to telephone to me if she thought that I\ncould be of any use or comfort to either of the ladies.",
    "I now proceeded to ring up the Sunday School teachers who\nwere coming at 7.45 for their weekly preparation class.",
    "I thought\nthat under the circumstances it would be better to put them off.",
    "Dennis was the next person to arrive on the scene having just\nreturned from a tennis party.",
    "The fact that murder had taken\nplace at the Vicarage seemed to afford him acute satisfaction.",
    "Fancy being right on the spot in a murder case he exclaimed.",
    "Ive always wanted to be right in the midst of one.",
    "Why have the\npolice locked up the study Wouldnt one of the other door keys\nfit it\n\nI refused to allow anything of the sort to be attempted.",
    "Dennis\ngave in with a bad grace.",
    "After extracting every possible detail\nfrom me he went out into the garden to look for footprints\nremarking cheerfully that it was lucky it was only old Protheroe\nwhom every one disliked.",
    "His cheerful callousness rather grated on me but I reflected that\nI was perhaps being hard on the boy.",
    "At Denniss age a detective\nstory is one of the best things in life and to find a real detective\nstory complete with corpse waiting on ones own front\ndoorstep so to speak is bound to send a healthyminded boy\ninto the seventh heaven of enjoyment.",
    "Death means very little to\na boy of sixteen.",
    "Griselda came back in about an hours time.",
    "She had seen Anne\nProtheroe having arrived just after the Inspector had broken the\nnews to her.",
    "On hearing that Mrs. Protheroe had last seen her husband in the\nvillage about a quarter to six and that she had no light of any\nkind to throw upon the matter he had taken his departure\nexplaining that he would return on the morrow for a fuller\ninterview.",
    "He was quite decent in his way said Griselda grudgingly.",
    "How did Mrs. Protheroe take it I asked.",
    "Well \u2014 she was very quiet \u2014 but then she always is.",
    "Yes I said.",
    "I cant imagine Anne Protheroe going into\nhysterics.",
    "Of course it was a great shock.",
    "You could see that.",
    "She thanked\nme for coming and said she was very grateful but that there was\nnothing I could do.",
    "What about Lettice\n\nShe was out playing tennis somewhere.",
    "She hadnt got home\nyet.",
    "There was a pause and then Griselda said\n\nYou know Len she was really very queer \u2014 very queer\nindeed.",
    "The shock I suggested.",
    "Yes \u2014 I suppose so.",
    "And yet \u2014 Griselda furrowed her brows\nperplexedly.",
    "It wasnt like that somehow.",
    "She didnt seem so\nmuch bowled over as \u2014 well \u2014 terrified.",
    "Terrified\n\n\fYes \u2014 not showing it you know.",
    "At least not meaning to show it.",
    "But a queer watchful look in her eyes.",
    "I wonder if she has a sort\nof idea who did kill him.",
    "She asked again and again if any one\nwere suspected.",
    "Did she I said thoughtfully.",
    "Yes.",
    "Of course Annes got marvellous selfcontrol but one\ncould see that she was terribly upset.",
    "More so than I would have\nthought for after all it wasnt as though she were so devoted to\nhim.",
    "I should have said she rather disliked him if anything.",
    "Death alters ones feelings sometimes I said.",
    "Yes I suppose so.",
    "Dennis came in and was full of excitement over a footprint he\nhad found in one of the flower beds.",
    "He was sure that the police\nhad overlooked it and that it would turn out to be the turning\npoint of the mystery.",
    "I spent a troubled night.",
    "Dennis was up and about and out of the\nhouse long before breakfast to study the latest developments\nas he said.",
    "Nevertheless it was not he but Mary who brought us the\nmornings sensational bit of news.",
    "We had just sat down to breakfast when she burst into the room\nher cheeks red and her eyes shining and addressed us with her\ncustomary lack of ceremony.",
    "Would you believe it The bakers just told me.",
    "Theyve arrested\nyoung Mr. Redding.",
    "Arrested Lawrence cried Griselda incredulously.",
    "Impossible.",
    "It must be some stupid mistake.",
    "No mistake about it mum said Mary with a kind of gloating\nexultation.",
    "Mr. Redding he went there himself and gave himself\nup.",
    "Last night last thing.",
    "Went right in threw down the pistol on\nthe table and I did it he says.",
    "Just like that.",
    "She looked at us both nodded her head vigorously and\nwithdrew satisfied with the effect she had produced.",
    "Griselda\nand I stared at each other.",
    "Oh it isnt true said Griselda.",
    "It cant be true.",
    "She noticed my silence and said Len you dont think its true\n\nI found it hard to answer her.",
    "I sat silent thoughts whirling\nthrough my head.",
    "He must be mad said Griselda.",
    "Absolutely mad.",
    "Or do you\nthink they were looking at the pistol together and it suddenly\nwent off.",
    "That doesnt sound at all a likely thing to happen.",
    "But it must have been an accident of some kind.",
    "Because\ntheres not a shadow of a motive.",
    "What earthly reason could\nLawrence have for killing Colonel Protheroe\n\n\fI could have answered that question very decidedly but I wished\nto spare Anne Protheroe as far as possible.",
    "There might still be a\nchance of keeping her name out of it.",
    "Remember they had had a quarrel I said.",
    "About Lettice and her bathing dress.",
    "Yes but thats absurd and\neven if he and Lettice were engaged secretly \u2014 well thats not a\nreason for killing her father.",
    "We dont know what the true facts of the case may be\nGriselda.",
    "You do believe it Len Oh how can you I tell you Im sure\nLawrence never touched a hair of his head.",
    "Remember I met him just outside the gate.",
    "He looked like a\nmadman.",
    "Yes but \u2014 oh its impossible.",
    "Theres the clock too I said.",
    "This explains the clock.",
    "Lawrence must have put it back to 6.20 with the idea of making\nan alibi for himself.",
    "Look how Inspector Slack fell into the trap.",
    "Youre wrong Len.",
    "Lawrence knew about that clock being fast.",
    "Keeping the vicar up to time he used to say.",
    "Lawrence would\nnever have made the mistake of putting it back to 6.20.",
    "Hed\nhave put the hands somewhere possible \u2014 like a quarter to\nseven.",
    "He maynt have known what time Protheroe got here.",
    "Or he may\nhave simply forgotten about the clock being fast.",
    "Griselda disagreed.",
    "No if you were committing a murder youd be awfully careful\nabout things like that.",
    "You dont know my dear I said mildly.",
    "Youve never done\none.",
    "Before Griselda could reply a shadow fell across the breakfast\ntable and a very gentle voice said\n\nI hope I am not intruding.",
    "You must forgive me.",
    "But in the sad\ncircumstances \u2014 the very sad circumstances \u2014\n\nIt was our neighbour Miss Marple.",
    "Accepting our polite\ndisclaimers she stepped in through the window and I drew up a\nchair for her.",
    "She looked faintly flushed and quite excited.",
    "Very terrible is it not Poor Colonel Protheroe.",
    "Not a very\npleasant man perhaps and not exactly popular but its none the\nless sad for that.",
    "And actually shot in the Vicarage study I\nunderstand\n\nI said that that had indeed been the case.",
    "But the dear vicar was not here at the time Miss Marple\nquestioned of Griselda.",
    "I explained where I had been.",
    "Mr. Dennis is not with you this morning said Miss Marple\nglancing round.",
    "Dennis said Griselda fancies himself as an amateur\ndetective.",
    "He is very excited about a footprint he found in one of\nthe flower beds and I fancy has gone off to tell the police about\nit.",
    "Dear dear said Miss Marple.",
    "Such a todo is it not And Mr.\nDennis thinks he knows who committed the crime.",
    "Well I\nsuppose we all think we know.",
    "You mean it is obvious said Griselda.",
    "No dear I didnt mean that at all.",
    "I dare say every one thinks it\nis somebody different.",
    "That is why it is so important to have\nproofs.",
    "I for instance am quite convinced I know who did it.",
    "But\nI must admit I havent one shadow of proof.",
    "One must I know be\nvery careful of what one says at a time like this \u2014 criminal libel\ndont they call it I had made up my mind to be most careful with\nInspector Slack.",
    "He sent word he would come and see me this\n\n\fmorning but now he has just phoned up to say it wont be\nnecessary after all.",
    "I suppose since the arrest it isnt necessary I said.",
    "The arrest Miss Marple leaned forward her cheeks pink with\nexcitement.",
    "I didnt know there had been an arrest.",
    "It is so seldom that Miss Marple is worse informed than we are\nthat I had taken it for granted that she would know the latest\ndevelopments.",
    "It seems we have been talking at cross purposes I said.",
    "Yes\nthere has been an arrest \u2014 Lawrence Redding.",
    "Lawrence Redding Miss Marple seemed very surprised.",
    "Now\nI should not have thought \u2014\n\nGriselda interrupted vehemently.",
    "I cant believe it even now.",
    "No not though he has actually\nconfessed.",
    "Confessed said Miss Marple.",
    "You say he has confessed Oh\ndear I see I have been sadly at sea \u2014 yes sadly at sea.",
    "I cant help feeling it must have been some kind of an accident\nsaid Griselda.",
    "Dont you think so Len I mean his coming\nforward to give himself up looks like that.",
    "Miss Marple leant forward eagerly.",
    "He gave himself up you say\n\nYes.",
    "Oh said Miss Marple with a deep sigh.",
    "I am so glad \u2014 so very\nglad.",
    "I looked at her in some surprise.",
    "It shows a true state of remorse I suppose I said.",
    "Remorse Miss Marple looked very surprised.",
    "Oh but surely\ndear dear vicar you dont think that he is guilty\n\nIt was my turn to stare.",
    "But since he has confessed \u2014\n\nYes but that just proves it doesnt it I mean that he had\nnothing to do with it.",
    "No I said.",
    "I may be dense but I cant see that it does.",
    "If you\nhave not committed a murder I cannot see the object of\npretending you have.",
    "Oh of course theres a reason said Miss Marple.",
    "Naturally.",
    "Theres always a reason isnt there And young men are so\nhotheaded and often prone to believe the worst.",
    "She turned to Griselda.",
    "Dont you agree with me my dear\n\nI \u2014 I dont know said Griselda.",
    "Its difficult to know what to\nthink.",
    "I cant see any reason for Lawrence behaving like a\nperfect idiot.",
    "If you had seen his face last night \u2014 I began.",
    "Tell me said Miss Marple.",
    "I described my homecoming while she listened attentively.",
    "When I had finished she said\n\nI know that I am very often rather foolish and dont take in\nthings as I should but I really do not see your point.",
    "It seems to me that if a young man had made up his mind to the\ngreat wickedness of taking a fellow creatures life he would not\nappear\n\ndistraught\n\nabout\n\nit\n\nafterwards.",
    "It\n\nwould\n\nbe\n\na\n\n\fpremeditated and coldblooded action and though the murderer\nmight be a little flurried and possibly might make some small\nmistake I do not think it likely he would fall into a state of\nagitation such as you describe.",
    "It is difficult to put oneself in\nsuch a position but I cannot imagine getting into a state like that\nmyself.",
    "We dont know the circumstances I argued.",
    "If there was a\nquarrel the shot may have been fired in a sudden gust of\npassion and Lawrence might afterwards have been appalled at\nwhat he had done.",
    "Indeed I prefer to think that that is what did\nactually occur.",
    "I know dear Mr. Clement that there are many ways we prefer\nto look at things.",
    "But one must actually take facts as they are\nmust one not And it does not seem to me that the facts bear the\ninterpretation you put upon them.",
    "Your maid distinctly stated\nthat Mr. Redding was only in the house a couple of minutes not\nlong enough surely for a quarrel such as you describe.",
    "And\nthen again I understand the colonel was shot through the back\n\n\fof the head while he was writing a letter \u2014 at least that is what\nmy maid told me.",
    "Quite true said Griselda.",
    "He seems to have been writing a\nnote to say he couldnt wait any longer.",
    "The note was dated 6.20\nand the clock on the table was overturned and had stopped at\n6.22 and thats just what has been puzzling Len and myself so\nfrightfully.",
    "She explained our custom of keeping the clock a quarter of an\nhour fast.",
    "Very curious said Miss Marple.",
    "Very curious indeed.",
    "But the\nnote seems to me even more curious still.",
    "I mean \u2014\n\nShe stopped and looked round.",
    "Lettice Protheroe was standing\noutside the window.",
    "She came in nodding to us and murmuring\nMorning.",
    "She dropped into a chair and said with rather more animation\nthan usual\n\n\fTheyve arrested Lawrence I hear.",
    "Yes said Griselda.",
    "Its been a great shock to us.",
    "I never rely thought any one would murder father said Lettice.",
    "She was obviously taking a pride in letting no hint of distress or\nemotion escape her.",
    "Lots of people wanted to Im sure.",
    "There\nare times when Id have liked to do it myself.",
    "Wont you have something to eat or drink Lettice asked\nGriselda.",
    "No thank you.",
    "I just drifted round to see if youd got my beret\nhere \u2014 a queer little yellow one.",
    "I think I left it in the study the\nother day.",
    "If you did its there still said Griselda.",
    "Mary never tidies\nanything.",
    "Ill go and see said Lettice rising.",
    "Sorry to be such a bother\nbut I seem to have lost everything else in the hat line.",
    "Im afraid you cant get it now I said.",
    "Inspector Slack has\nlocked the room up.",
    "Oh what a bore.",
    "Cant we get in through the window\n\nIm afraid not.",
    "It is latched on the inside.",
    "Surely Lettice a\nyellow beret wont be much good to you at present\n\nYou mean mourning and all that I shant bother about\nmourning.",
    "I think its an awfully archaic idea.",
    "Its a nuisance\nabout Lawrence \u2014 yes its a nuisance.",
    "She got up and stood frowning abstractedly.",
    "I suppose its all on account of me and my bathing dress.",
    "So\nsilly the whole thing .",
    ". .\n\n\fGriselda opened her mouth to say something but for some\nunexplained reason shut it again.",
    "A curious smile came to Lettices lips.",
    "I think she said softly Ill go home and tell Anne about\nLawrence being arrested.",
    "She went out of the window again.",
    "Griselda turned to Miss\nMarple.",
    "Why did you step on my foot\n\nThe old lady was smiling.",
    "I thought you were going to say something my dear.",
    "And it is\noften so much better to let things develop on their own lines.",
    "I\ndont think you know that that child is half so vague as she\npretends to be.",
    "Shes got a very definite idea in her head and\nshes acting upon it.",
    "Mary gave a loud knock on the diningroom door and entered\nhard upon it.",
    "What is it said Griselda.",
    "And Mary you must remember not\nto knock on doors.",
    "Ive told you about it before.",
    "Thought you might be busy said Mary.",
    "Colonel Melchetts\nhere.",
    "Wants to see the master.",
    "Colonel Melchett is Chief Constable of the county.",
    "I rose at once.",
    "I thought you wouldnt like my leaving him in the hall so I put\nhim in the drawingroom went on Mary.",
    "Shall I clear\n\nNot yet said Griselda.",
    "Ill ring.",
    "She turned to Miss Marple and I left the room.",
    "Chapter VII\n\nColonel Melchett is a dapper little man with a habit of snorting\nsuddenly and unexpectedly.",
    "He has red hair and rather keen\nbright blue eyes.",
    "Goodmorning vicar he said.",
    "Nasty business eh Poor old\nProtheroe.",
    "Not that I liked him.",
    "I didnt.",
    "Nobody did for that\nmatter.",
    "Nasty bit of work for you too.",
    "Hope it hasnt upset your\nmissus\n\nI said Griselda had taken it very well.",
    "Thats lucky.",
    "Rotten thing to happen in ones house.",
    "I must say\nIm surprised at young Redding \u2014 doing it the way he did.",
    "No\nsort of consideration for any ones feelings.",
    "A wild desire to laugh came over me but Colonel Melchett\nevidently saw nothing odd in the idea of a murderer being\nconsiderate so I held my peace.",
    "I must say I was rather taken aback when I heard the fellow had\nmarched in and given himself up continued Colonel Melchett\ndropping on to a chair.",
    "How did it happen exactly\n\nLast night.",
    "About ten oclock.",
    "Fellow rolls in throws down a\npistol and says Here I am.",
    "I did it.",
    "Just like that.",
    "What account does he give of the business\n\nPrecious little.",
    "He was warned of course about making a\nstatement.",
    "But he merely laughed.",
    "Said he came here to see you\n\u2014 found Protheroe here.",
    "They had words and he shot him.",
    "Wont\nsay what the quarrel was about.",
    "Look here Clement \u2014 just\nbetween you and me do you know anything about it Ive heard\nrumours \u2014 about his being forbidden the house and all that.",
    "What was it \u2014 did he seduce the daughter or what We dont\nwant to bring the girl into it more than we can help for\neverybodys sake.",
    "Was that the trouble\n\n\fNo I said.",
    "You can take it from me that it was something quite\ndifferent but I cant say more at the present juncture.",
    "He nodded and rose.",
    "Im glad to know.",
    "Theres a lot of talk.",
    "Too many women in this\npart of the world.",
    "Well I must get along.",
    "Ive got to see Haydock.",
    "He was called out to some case or other but he ought to be back\nby now.",
    "I dont mind telling you Im sorry about Redding.",
    "He\nalways struck me as a decent young chap.",
    "Perhaps theyll think\nout some kind of defence for him.",
    "Aftereffects of war shell\nshock or something.",
    "Especially if no very adequate motive turns\nup.",
    "I must be off.",
    "Like to come along\n\nI said I would like to very much and we went out together.",
    "Haydocks house is next door to mine.",
    "His servant said the\ndoctor had just come in and showed us into the diningroom\nwhere Haydock was sitting down to a steaming plate of eggs and\nbacon.",
    "He greeted me with an amiable nod.",
    "Sorry I had to go out.",
    "Confinement case.",
    "Ive been up most of\nthe night over your business.",
    "Ive got the bullet for you.",
    "He shoved a little box along the table.",
    "Melchett examined it.",
    "Point two five\n\nHaydock nodded.",
    "Ill keep the technical details for the inquest he said.",
    "All you\nwant to know is that death was practically instantaneous.",
    "Silly\nyoung fool what did he want to do it for Amazing by the way\nthat nobody heard the shot.",
    "Yes said Melchett that surprises me.",
    "The kitchen window gives on the other side of the house I\nsaid.",
    "With the study door the pantry door and the kitchen door\nall shut I doubt if you would hear anything and there was no one\nbut the maid in the house.",
    "Hm said Melchett.",
    "Its odd all the same.",
    "I wonder the old\nlady \u2014 whats her name \u2014 Marple didnt hear it.",
    "The study\nwindow was open.",
    "Perhaps she did said Haydock.",
    "I dont think she did said I.",
    "She was over at the Vicarage just\nnow and she didnt mention anything of the kind which Im\ncertain she would have done if there had been anything to tell.",
    "May have heard it and paid no attention to it \u2014 thought it was a\ncar backfiring.",
    "It struck me that Haydock was looking much more jovial and\ngoodhumoured this morning.",
    "He seemed like a man who was\ndecorously trying to subdue unusually good spirits.",
    "Or what about a silencer he added.",
    "Thats quite likely.",
    "Nobody would hear anything then.",
    "Melchett shook his head.",
    "Slack didnt find anything of the kind and he asked Redding\nand Redding didnt seem to know what he was talking about at\nfirst and then denied point blank using anything of the kind.",
    "And I\nsuppose one can take his word for it.",
    "Yes indeed poor devil.",
    "Damned young fool said Colonel Melchett.",
    "Sorry Clement.",
    "But he really is Somehow one cant get used to thinking of him\nas a murderer.",
    "Any motive asked Haydock taking a final draught of coffee\nand pushing back his chair.",
    "He says they quarrelled and he lost his temper and shot him.",
    "Hoping for manslaughter eh The doctor shook his head.",
    "That story doesnt hold water.",
    "He stole up behind him as he was\n\n\fwriting and shot him through the head.",
    "Precious little quarrel\nabout that.",
    "Anyway there wouldnt have been time for a quarrel I said\nremembering Miss Marples words.",
    "To creep up shoot him\nalter the clock hands back to 6.20 and leave again would have\ntaken him all his time.",
    "I shall never forget his face when I met him\noutside the gate or the way he said You want to see Protheroe\n\u2014 oh youll see him all right That in itself ought to have made\nme suspicious of what had just taken place a few minutes\nbefore.",
    "Haydock stared at me.",
    "What do you mean \u2014 what had just taken place When do you\nthink Redding shot him\n\nA few minutes before I got to the house.",
    "The doctor shook his head.",
    "Impossible.",
    "Plumb impossible.",
    "Hed been dead much longer\nthan that.",
    "But my dear man cried Colonel Melchett you said yourself\nthat half an hour was only an approximate estimate.",
    "Half an hour thirtyfive minutes twentyfive minutes twenty\nminutes \u2014 possibly but less no.",
    "Why the body would have been\nwarm when I got to it.",
    "We stared at each other.",
    "Haydocks face had changed.",
    "It had\ngone suddenly grey and old.",
    "I wondered at the change in him.",
    "But look here Haydock.",
    "The colonel found his voice.",
    "If\nRedding admits shooting him at a quarter to seven \u2014\n\nHaydock sprang to his feet.",
    "I tell you its impossible he roared.",
    "If Redding says he killed\nProtheroe at a quarter to seven then Redding lies.",
    "Hang it all I\n\n\ftell you Im a doctor and I know.",
    "The blood had begun to\ncongeal.",
    "If Redding is lying began Melchett.",
    "He stopped shook his\nhead.",
    "Wed better go down to the police station and see him he said.",
    "Chapter VIII\n\nWe were rather silent on our way down to the police station.",
    "Haydock drew behind a little and murmured to me\n\nYou know I dont like the look of this.",
    "I dont like it.",
    "Theres\nsomething here we dont understand.",
    "He looked thoroughly worried and upset.",
    "Inspector Slack was at the police station and presently we found\nourselves face to face with Lawrence Redding.",
    "He looked pale and strained but quite composed \u2014 marvellously\nso I thought considering the circumstances.",
    "Melchett snorted\nand hummed obviously nervous.",
    "Look here Redding he said I understand you made a\nstatement to Inspector Slack here.",
    "You state you went to the\nVicarage at approximately a quarter to seven found Protheroe\nthere quarrelled with him shot him and came away.",
    "Im not\nreading it over to you but thats the gist of it.",
    "Yes.",
    "Im going to ask a few questions.",
    "Youve already been told that\nyou neednt answer them unless you choose.",
    "Your solicitor \u2014\n\n\fLawrence interrupted.",
    "Ive nothing to hide.",
    "I killed Protheroe.",
    "Ah well \u2014 Melchett snorted.",
    "How did you happen to have a\npistol with you\n\nLawrence hesitated.",
    "It was in my pocket.",
    "You took it with you to the Vicarage\n\nYes.",
    "Why\n\nI always take it.",
    "He had hesitated again before answering and I was absolutely\nsure that he was not speaking the truth.",
    "Why did you put the clock back\n\n\fThe clock He seemed puzzled.",
    "Yes the hands pointed to 6.22.",
    "A look of fear sprang up in his face.",
    "Oh that \u2014 yes.",
    "I \u2014 I altered it.",
    "Haydock spoke suddenly.",
    "Where did you shoot Colonel Protheroe\n\nIn the study at the Vicarage.",
    "I mean in what part of the body\n\nOh \u2014 I \u2014 through the head I think.",
    "Yes through the head.",
    "Arent you sure\n\n\fSince you know I cant see why it is necessary to ask me.",
    "It\nwas a feeble kind of bluster.",
    "There was some commotion\noutside.",
    "A constable without a helmet brought in a note.",
    "For the vicar.",
    "It says very urgent on it.",
    "I tore it open and read\n\nPlease \u2014 please \u2014 come to me.",
    "I dont know what to do.",
    "It is all\ntoo awful.",
    "I want to tell someone.",
    "Please come immediately and\nbring any one you like with you.",
    "\u2014 ANNE PROTHEROE.",
    "I gave Melchett a meaning glance.",
    "He took the hint.",
    "We all went\nout together.",
    "Glancing over my shoulder I had a glimpse of\nLawrence Reddings face.",
    "His eyes were riveted on the paper in\nmy hand and I have hardly ever seen such a terrible look of\nanguish and despair in any human beings face.",
    "I remembered Anne Protheroe sitting on my sofa and saying\n\nIm a desperate woman and my heart grew heavy within me.",
    "I\nsaw now the possible reason for Lawrence Reddings heroic\nselfaccusation.",
    "Melchett was speaking to Slack.",
    "Have you got any line on Reddings movements earlier in the\nday Theres some reason to think he shot Protheroe earlier\nthan he says.",
    "Get on to it will you\n\nHe turned to me and without a word I handed him Anne\nProtheroes letter.",
    "He read it and pursed up his lips in\nastonishment.",
    "Then he looked at me inquiringly.",
    "Is this what you were hinting at this morning \n\nYes.",
    "I was not sure then if it was my duty to speak.",
    "I am quite\nsure now.",
    "And I told him of what I had seen that night in the\nstudio.",
    "The colonel had a few words with the inspector and then we set\noff for Old Hall.",
    "Dr. Haydock came with us.",
    "A very correct butler opened the door with just the right amount\nof gloom in his bearing.",
    "Goodmorning said Melchett.",
    "Will you ask Mrs. Protheroes\nmaid to tell her we are here and would like to see her and then\nreturn here and answer a few questions.",
    "The butler hurried away and presently returned with the news\nthat he had despatched the message.",
    "Now lets hear something about yesterday said Colonel\nMelchett.",
    "Your master was in to lunch\n\nYes sir.",
    "And in his usual spirits\n\nAs far as I could see yes sir.",
    "What happened after that\n\nAfter luncheon Mrs. Protheroe went to lie down and the colonel\nwent to his study.",
    "Miss Lettice went out to a tennis party in the\ntwoseater.",
    "Colonel and Mrs. Protheroe had tea at fourthirty in\nthe drawingroom.",
    "The car was ordered for fivethirty to take\nthem to the village.",
    "Immediately after they had left Mr. Clement\nrang up \u2014 he bowed to me \u2014 I told him they had started.",
    "Hm said Colonel Melchett.",
    "When was Mr. Redding last\nhere\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon sir.",
    "I understand that there was a disagreement between them\n\nI believe so sir.",
    "The colonel gave me orders that Mr. Redding\nwas not to be admitted in future.",
    "Did you overhear the quarrel at all asked Colonel Melchett\nbluntly.",
    "Colonel Protheroe sir had a very loud voice especially when it\nwas raised in anger.",
    "I was unable to help overhearing a few\nwords here and there.",
    "Enough to tell you the cause of the dispute\n\nI understood sir that it had to do with a portrait Mr. Redding\nhad been painting \u2014 a portrait of Miss Lettice.",
    "Melchett grunted.",
    "Did you see Mr. Redding when he left\n\nYes sir I let him out.",
    "Did he seem angry\n\nNo sir if I may say so he seemed rather amused.",
    "Ah He didnt come to the house yesterday\n\nNo sir.",
    "Any one else come\n\nNot yesterday sir.",
    "Well the day before\n\nMr. Dennis Clement came in the afternoon.",
    "And Dr. Stone was\nhere for some time.",
    "And there was a lady in the evening.",
    "A lady Melchett was surprised.",
    "Who was she\n\nThe butler couldnt remember her name.",
    "It was a lady he had not\nseen before.",
    "Yes she had given her name and when he told her\nthat the family were at dinner she had said that she would wait.",
    "So he had shown her into the little morningroom.",
    "She had asked for Colonel Protheroe not Mrs. Protheroe.",
    "He\nhad told the colonel and the colonel had gone to the morningroom directly dinner was over.",
    "How long had the lady stayed He thought about half an hour.",
    "The colonel himself had let her out.",
    "Ah yes he remembered her\nname now.",
    "The lady had been a Mrs. Lestrange.",
    "This was a surprise.",
    "Curious said Melchett.",
    "Really very curious.",
    "But we pursued the matter no further for at that moment a\nmessage came that Mrs. Protheroe would see us.",
    "Anne was in bed.",
    "Her face was pale and her eyes very bright.",
    "There was a look on her face that puzzled me \u2014 a kind of grim\ndetermination.",
    "She spoke to me.",
    "Thank you for coming so promptly she said.",
    "I see youve\nunderstood what I meant by bringing any one you liked with\nyou.",
    "She paused.",
    "Its best to get it over quickly isnt it she said.",
    "She gave a\nqueer halfpathetic little smile.",
    "I suppose youre the person I\nought to say it to Colonel Melchett.",
    "You see it was I who killed\nmy husband.",
    "Colonel Melchett said gently\n\nMy dear Mrs. Protheroe \u2014\n\nOh its quite true.",
    "I suppose Ive said it rather bluntly but I\nnever can go into hysterics over anything.",
    "Ive hated him for a\nlong time and yesterday I shot him.",
    "She lay back on the pillows and closed her eyes.",
    "Thats all.",
    "I suppose youll arrest me and take me away.",
    "Ill get\nup and dress as soon as I can.",
    "At the moment I am feeling rather\nsick.",
    "Are you aware Mrs. Protheroe that Mr. Lawrence Redding has\nalready accused himself of committing the crime.",
    "Anne opened her eyes and nodded brightly.",
    "I know.",
    "Silly boy.",
    "Hes very much in love with me you know.",
    "It\nwas frightfully noble of him \u2014 but very silly.",
    "He knew that it was you who had committed the crime\n\nYes.",
    "How did he know\n\nShe hesitated.",
    "Did you tell him\n\n\fStill she hesitated.",
    "Then at last she seemed to make up her mind.",
    "Yes \u2014 I told him .",
    ". .\n\nShe twitched her shoulders with a movement of irritation.",
    "Cant you go away now Ive told you.",
    "I dont want to talk about\nit any more.",
    "Where did you get the pistol Mrs. Protheroe\n\nThe pistol Oh it was my husbands.",
    "I got it out of the drawer of\nhis dressingtable.",
    "I see.",
    "And you took it with you to the Vicarage\n\nYes.",
    "I knew he would be there \u2014\n\nWhat time was this\n\n\fIt must have been after six \u2014 quarter \u2014 twenty past \u2014\nsomething like that.",
    "You took the pistol meaning to shoot your husband\n\nNo \u2014 I \u2014 I meant it for myself.",
    "I see.",
    "But you went to the Vicarage\n\nYes.",
    "I went along to the window.",
    "There were no voices.",
    "I looked\nin.",
    "I saw my husband.",
    "Something came over me \u2014 and I fired.",
    "And then\n\nThen Oh then I went away.",
    "And told Mr. Redding what you had done\n\nAgain I noticed the hesitation in her voice before she said Yes.",
    "Did anybody see you entering or leaving the Vicarage\n\n\fNo \u2014 at least yes.",
    "Old Miss Marple.",
    "I talked to her a few\nminutes.",
    "She was in her garden.",
    "She moved restlessly on the pillows.",
    "Isnt that enough Ive told you.",
    "Why do you want to go on\nbothering me\n\nDr. Haydock moved to her side and felt her pulse.",
    "He beckoned to Melchett.",
    "Ill stay with her he said in a whisper whilst you make the\nnecessary arrangements.",
    "She oughtnt to be left.",
    "Might do\nherself a mischief.",
    "Melchett nodded.",
    "We left the room and descended the stairs.",
    "I saw a thin\ncadaverouslooking man come out of the adjoining room and on\nimpulse I remounted the stairs.",
    "Are you Colonel Protheroes valet\n\nThe man looked surprised.",
    "Yes sir.",
    "Do you know whether your late master kept a pistol anywhere\n\nNot that I know of sir.",
    "Not in one of the drawers of his dressingtable Think man.",
    "The valet shook his head decisively.",
    "Im quite sure he didnt sir.",
    "Id have seen it if so.",
    "Bound to.",
    "I hurried down the stairs after the others.",
    "Mrs. Protheroe had lied about the pistol.",
    "Why\n\nChapter IX\n\nAfter leaving a message at the police station the Chief\nConstable announced his intention of paying a visit to Miss\nMarple.",
    "Youd better come with me vicar he said.",
    "I dont want to give\na member of your flock hysterics.",
    "So lend the weight of your\nsoothing presence.",
    "I smiled.",
    "For an her fragile appearance Miss Marple is capable\nof holding her own with any policeman or Chief Constable in\nexistence.",
    "Whats she like asked the colonel as we rang the bell.",
    "Anything she says to be depended upon or otherwise\n\nI considered the matter.",
    "I think she is quite dependable I said cautiously.",
    "That is in so\nfar as she is talking of what she has actually seen.",
    "Beyond that\nof course when you get on to what she thinks \u2014 well that is\nanother\n\nmatter.",
    "She\n\nhas\n\na\n\npowerful\n\nimagination\n\nand\n\nsystematically thinks the worst of every one.",
    "The typical elderly spinster in fact said Melchett with a\nlaugh.",
    "Well I ought to know the breed by now.",
    "Gad the tea\nparties down here\n\nWe were admitted by a very diminutive maid and shown into a\nsmall drawingroom.",
    "A bit crowded said Colonel Melchett looking round.",
    "But\nplenty of good stuff.",
    "A ladys room eh Clement\n\nI agreed and at that moment the door opened and Miss Marple\nmade her appearance.",
    "Very sorry to bother you Miss Marple said the colonel when I\nhad introduced him putting on his bluff military manner which he\nhad an idea was attractive to elderly ladies.",
    "Got to do my duty\nyou know.",
    "Of course of course said Miss Marple.",
    "I quite understand.",
    "Wont you sit down And might I offer you a little glass of cherry\nbrandy My own making.",
    "A receipt of my grandmothers.",
    "Thank you very much Miss Marple.",
    "Very kind of you.",
    "But I think\nI wont.",
    "Nothing till lunch time thats my motto.",
    "Now I want to\ntalk to you about this sad business \u2014 very sad business indeed.",
    "Upset us all Im sure.",
    "Well it seems possible that owing to the\n\n\fposition of your house and garden you may have been able to\ntell us something we want to know about yesterday evening.",
    "As a matter of fact I was in my little garden from five oclock\nonwards yesterday and of course from there \u2014 well one\nsimply cannot help seeing anything that is going on next door.",
    "I understand Miss Marple that Mrs. Protheroe passed this way\nyesterday evening\n\nYes she did.",
    "I called out to her and she admired my roses.",
    "Could you tell us about what time that was\n\nI should say it was just a minute or two after a quarter past six.",
    "Yes thats right.",
    "The church clock had just chimed the quarter.",
    "Very good.",
    "What happened next\n\nWell Mrs. Protheroe said she was calling for her husband at the\nVicarage so that they could go home together.",
    "She had come\n\n\falong the lane you understand and she went into the Vicarage\nby the back gate and across the garden.",
    "She came from the lane\n\nYes Ill show you.",
    "PLAN C\n\nFull of eagerness Miss Marple led us out into the garden and\npointed out the lane that ran along by the bottom of the garden.",
    "The path opposite with the stile leads to the Hall she\nexplained.",
    "That was the way they were going home together.",
    "Mrs. Protheroe came from the village.",
    "Perfectly perfectly said Colonel Melchett.",
    "And she went\nacross to the Vicarage you say\n\nYes.",
    "I saw her turn the corner of the house.",
    "I suppose the\ncolonel wasnt there yet because she came back almost\nimmediately and went down the lawn to the studio \u2014 that\nbuilding there.",
    "The one the vicar lets Mr. Redding use as a\nstudio.",
    "I see.",
    "And \u2014 you didnt happen to hear a shot Miss Marple\n\nI didnt hear a shot then said Miss Marple.",
    "But did you hear one sometime\n\nYes I think there was a shot somewhere in the woods.",
    "But quite\nfive or ten minutes afterwards \u2014 and as I say out in the woods.",
    "At least I think so.",
    "It couldnt have been \u2014 surely it couldnt have\nbeen \u2014\n\nShe stopped pale with excitement.",
    "Yes yes well come to all that presently said Colonel\nMelchett.",
    "Please go on with your story.",
    "Mrs. Protheroe went\ndown to the studio\n\nYes she went inside and waited.",
    "Presently Mr. Redding came\nalong the lane from the village.",
    "He came to the Vicarage gate\nlooked all round \u2014\n\nAnd saw you Miss Marple.",
    "As a matter of fact he didnt see me said Miss Marple flushing\nslightly.",
    "Because you see just at that minute I was bending\nright over \u2014 trying to get up one of those nasty dandelions you\nknow.",
    "So difficult.",
    "And then he went through the gate and down\nto the studio.",
    "He didnt go near the house\n\nOh no he went straight to the studio.",
    "Mrs. Protheroe came to\nthe door to meet him and then they both went inside.",
    "Here Miss Marple contributed a singularly eloquent pause.",
    "Perhaps she was sitting to him I suggested.",
    "Perhaps said Miss Marple.",
    "And they came out \u2014 when\n\nAbout ten minutes later.",
    "That was roughly\n\nThe church clock had chimed the halfhour.",
    "They strolled out\nthrough the garden gate and along the lane and just at that\nminute Dr. Stone came down the path leading to the Hall and\nclimbed over the stile and joined them.",
    "They all walked towards\nthe village together.",
    "At the end of the lane I think but I cant be\nquite sure they were joined by Miss Cram.",
    "I think it must have\nbeen Miss Cram because her skirts were so short.",
    "You must have very good eyesight Miss Marple if you can\nobserve as far as that.",
    "I was observing a bird said Miss Marple.",
    "A golden crested\nwren I think he was.",
    "A sweet little fellow.",
    "I had my glasses out\nand thats how I happened to see Miss Cram if it was Miss Cram\nand I think so join them.",
    "Ah well that may be so said Colonel Melchett.",
    "Now since\nyou seem very good at observing did you happen to notice Miss\nMarple what sort of expression Mrs. Protheroe and Mr. Redding\nhad as they passed along the lane\n\nThey were smiling and talking said Miss Marple.",
    "They\nseemed very happy to be together if you know what I mean.",
    "They didnt seem upset or disturbed in any way\n\nOh no Just the opposite.",
    "Deuced odd said the colonel.",
    "Theres something deuced odd\nabout the whole thing.",
    "Miss Marple suddenly took our breath away by remarking in a\nplacid voice\n\nHas Mrs. Protheroe been saying that she committed the crime\nnow\n\nUpon my soul said the colonel how did you come to guess\nthat Miss Marple\n\nWell I rather thought it might happen said Miss Marple.",
    "I\nthink dear Lettice thought so too.",
    "Shes really a very sharp girl.",
    "Not always very scrupulous Im afraid.",
    "So Anne Protheroe says\nshe killed her husband.",
    "Well well.",
    "I dont think its true.",
    "No Im\nalmost sure it isnt true.",
    "Not with a woman like Anne Protheroe.",
    "Although one never can be quite sure about any one can one\nAt least thats what Ive found.",
    "When does she say she shot\nhim\n\n\fAt twenty minutes past six.",
    "Just after speaking to you.",
    "Miss Marple shook her head slowly and pityingly.",
    "The pity was I\nthink for two fullgrown men being so foolish as to believe such\na story.",
    "At least that is what we felt like.",
    "What did she shoot him with\n\nA pistol.",
    "Where did she find it\n\nShe brought it with her.",
    "Well that she didnt do said Miss Marple with unexpected\ndecision.",
    "I can swear to that.",
    "Shed no such thing with her.",
    "You mightnt have seen it.",
    "Of course I should have seen it.",
    "If it had been in her handbag.",
    "She wasnt carrying a handbag.",
    "Well it might have been concealed \u2014 er \u2014 upon her person.",
    "Miss Marple directed a glance of sorrow and scorn upon him.",
    "My dear Colonel Melchett you know what young women are\nnowadays.",
    "Not ashamed to show exactly how the creator made\nthem.",
    "She hadnt so much as a handkerchief in the top of her\nstocking.",
    "Melchett was obstinate.",
    "You must admit that it all fits in he said.",
    "The time the\noverturned clock pointing to 6.22 \u2014\n\nMiss Marple turned on me.",
    "Do you mean you havent told him about that clock yet\n\n\fWhat about the clock Clement\n\nI told him.",
    "He showed a good deal of annoyance.",
    "Why on earth didnt you tell Slack this last night\n\nBecause I said he wouldnt let me.",
    "Nonsense you ought to have insisted.",
    "Probably I said Inspector Slack behaves quite differently to\nyou than he does to me.",
    "I had no earthly chance of insisting.",
    "Its an extraordinary business altogether said Melchett.",
    "If a\nthird person comes along and claims to have done this murder I\nshall go into a lunatic asylum.",
    "If I might be allowed to suggest \u2014 murmured Miss Marple.",
    "Well\n\n\fIf you were to tell Mr. Redding what Mrs. Protheroe has done\nand then explain that you dont really believe it is her.",
    "And then if\nyou were to go to Mrs. Protheroe and tell her that Mr. Redding is\nall right \u2014 why then they might each of them tell you the truth.",
    "And the truth is helpful though I dare say they dont know very\nmuch themselves poor things.",
    "Its all very well but they are the only two people who had a\nmotive for making away with Protheroe.",
    "Oh I wouldnt say that Colonel Melchett said Miss Marple.",
    "Why can you think of any one else\n\nOh yes indeed.",
    "Why she counted on her fingers one two\nthree four five six \u2014 yes and a possible seven.",
    "I can think of at\nleast seven people who might be very glad to have Colonel\nProtheroe out of the way.",
    "The colonel looked at her feebly.",
    "Seven people In St. Mary Mead\n\nMiss Marple nodded brightly.",
    "Mind you I name no names she said.",
    "That wouldnt be right.",
    "But Im afraid theres a lot of wickedness in the world.",
    "A nice\nhonourable upright soldier like you doesnt know about these\nthings Colonel Melchett.",
    "I thought the Chief Constable was going to have apoplexy.",
    "Chapter X\n\nHis remarks on the subject of Miss Marple as we left the house\nwere far from complimentary.",
    "I really believe that wizenedup old maid thinks she knows\neverything there is to know.",
    "And hardly been out of this village\nall her life.",
    "Preposterous.",
    "What can she know of life\n\nI said mildly that though doubtless Miss Marple knew next to\nnothing of Life with a capital L she knew practically everything\nthat went on in St. Mary Mead.",
    "Melchett admitted that grudgingly.",
    "She was a valuable witness\n\u2014 particularly valuable from Mrs. Protheroes point of view.",
    "I suppose theres no doubt about what she says eh\n\nIf Miss Marple says she had no pistol with her you can take it\nfor granted that it is so I said.",
    "If there was the least possibility\n\n\fof such a thing Miss Marple would have been on to it like a\nknife.",
    "Thats true enough.",
    "Wed better go and have a look at the\nstudio.",
    "The socalled studio was a mere rough shed with a skylight.",
    "There were no windows and the door was the only means of\nentrance or egress.",
    "Satisfied on this score Melchett announced\nhis intention of visiting the Vicarage with the inspector.",
    "Im going to the police station now.",
    "As I entered through the front door a murmur of voices caught\nmy ear.",
    "I opened the drawingroom door.",
    "On the sofa beside Griselda conversing animatedly sat Miss\nGladys Cram.",
    "Her legs which were encased in particularly shiny\npink stockings were crossed and I had every opportunity of\nobserving that she wore pink striped silk knickers.",
    "Hullo Len said Griselda.",
    "Goodmorning Mr. Clement said Miss Cram.",
    "Isnt the news\nabout the colonel really too awful Poor old gentleman.",
    "Miss Cram said my wife very kindly came in to offer to help\nus with the Guides.",
    "We asked for helpers last Sunday you\nremember.",
    "I did remember and I was convinced and so I knew from her\ntone was Griselda that the idea of enrolling herself among them\nwould never have occurred to Miss Cram but for the exciting\nincident which had taken place at the Vicarage.",
    "I was only just saying to Mrs. Clement went on Miss Cram\nyou could have struck me all of a heap when I heard the news.",
    "A\nmurder I said.",
    "In this quiet onehorse village \u2014 for quiet it is\nyou must admit \u2014 not so much as a picture house and as for\nTalkies And then when I heard it was Colonel Protheroe \u2014 why\nI simply couldnt believe it.",
    "He didnt seem the kind somehow to\nget murdered.",
    "And so said Griselda Miss Cram came round to find out all\nabout it.",
    "I feared this plain speaking might offend the lady but she merely\nflung her head back and laughed uproariously showing every\ntooth she possessed.",
    "Thats too bad.",
    "Youre a sharp one arent you Mrs. Clement\nBut its only natural isnt it to want to hear the ins and out of a\ncase like this And Im sure Im willing enough to help with the\nGuides in any way you like.",
    "Exciting thats what it is.",
    "Ive been\nstagnating for a bit of fun.",
    "I have really I have.",
    "Not that my job\nisnt a very good one well paid and Dr. Stone quite the\ngentleman in every way.",
    "But a girl wants a bit of life out of office\nhours and except for you Mrs. Clement who is there in the\nplace to talk to except a lot of old cats\n\nTheres Lettice Protheroe I said.",
    "Gladys Cram tossed her head.",
    "Shes too high and mighty for the likes of me.",
    "Fancies herself\nthe county and wouldnt demean herself by noticing a girl who\nhad to work for her living.",
    "Not but what I did hear her talking of\nearning her living herself.",
    "And whod employ her I should like to\nknow Why shed be fired in less than a week.",
    "Unless she went\nas one of those mannequins all dressed up and sidling about.",
    "She could do that I expect.",
    "Shed make a very good mannequin said Griselda.",
    "Shes got\nsuch a lovely figure.",
    "Theres nothing of the cat about Griselda.",
    "When was she talking of earning her own living\n\nMiss Cram seemed momentarily discomfited but recovered\nherself with her usual archness.",
    "That would be telling wouldnt it she said.",
    "But she did say\nso.",
    "Things not very happy at home I fancy.",
    "Catch me living at\nhome with a stepmother.",
    "I wouldnt sit down under it for a\nminute.",
    "Ah but youre so high spirited and independent said Griselda\ngravely and I looked at her with suspicion.",
    "Miss Cram was clearly pleased.",
    "Thats right.",
    "Thats me all over.",
    "Can be led not driven.",
    "A palmist\ntold me that not so very long ago.",
    "No.",
    "Im not one to sit down and\nbe bullied.",
    "And Ive made it clear all along to Dr. Stone that I\nmust have my regular times off.",
    "These scientific gentlemen they\nthink a girls a kind of machine \u2014 half the time they just dont\nnotice her or remember shes there.",
    "Do you find Dr. Stone pleasant to work with It must be an\ninteresting job if you are interested in arch\u00e6ology.",
    "Of course I dont know much about it confessed the girl.",
    "It\nstill seems to me that digging up people that are dead and have\nbeen dead for hundreds of years isnt \u2014 well it seems a bit\nnosey doesnt it And theres Dr. Stone so wrapped up in it all\nthat half the time hed forget his meals if it wasnt for me.",
    "Is he at the barrow this morning asked Griselda.",
    "Miss Cram shook her head.",
    "A bit under the weather this morning she explained.",
    "Not up to\ndoing any work.",
    "That means a holiday for little Gladys.",
    "Im sorry I said.",
    "Oh its nothing much.",
    "Theres not going to be a second death.",
    "But do tell me Mr. Clement I hear youve been with the police all\nmorning.",
    "What do they think\n\nWell I said slowly there is still a little \u2014 uncertainty.",
    "Ah cried Miss Cram.",
    "Then they dont think it is Mr. Lawrence\nRedding after all.",
    "So handsome isnt he Just like a movie star.",
    "And such a nice smile when he says goodmorning to you.",
    "I\nreally couldnt believe my ears when I heard the police had\narrested him.",
    "Still one has always heard theyre very stupid \u2014\nthe county police.",
    "You can hardly blame them in this instance I said.",
    "Mr.\nRedding came in and gave himself up.",
    "What the girl was clearly dumbfounded.",
    "Well \u2014 of all the\npoor fish If Id committed a murder I wouldnt go straight off and\ngive myself up.",
    "I should have thought Lawrence Redding would\nhave had more sense.",
    "To give in like that What did he kill\nProtheroe for Did he say Was it just a quarrel\n\nIts not absolutely certain that he did kill him I said.",
    "But surely \u2014 if he says he has \u2014 why really Mr. Clement he\nought to know.",
    "He ought to certainly I agreed.",
    "But the police are not\nsatisfied with his story.",
    "But why should he say hed done it if he hasnt\n\n\fThat was a point on which I had no intention of enlightening Miss\nCram.",
    "Instead I said rather vaguely\n\nI believe that in all prominent murder cases the police receive\nnumerous letters from people accusing themselves of the\ncrime.",
    "Miss Crams reception of this piece of information was\n\nThey must be chumps in a tone of wonder and scorn.",
    "Well she said with a sigh I suppose I must be trotting along.",
    "She rose.",
    "Mr. Redding accusing himself of the murder will be a\nbit of news for Dr. Stone.",
    "Is he interested  asked Griselda.",
    "Miss Cram furrowed her brows perplexedly.",
    "Hes a queer one.",
    "You never can tell with him.",
    "All wrapped up in\nthe past.",
    "Hed a hundred times rather look at a nasty old bronze\n\n\fknife out of one of those humps of ground than he would see the\nknife Crippen cut up his wife with supposing he had a chance\nto.",
    "Well I said I must confess I agree with him.",
    "Miss Crams eyes expressed incomprehension and slight\ncontempt.",
    "Then with reiterated goodbyes she took her\ndeparture.",
    "Not such a bad sort really said Griselda as the door closed\nbehind her.",
    "Terribly common of course but one of those big\nbouncing goodhumoured girls that you cant dislike.",
    "I wonder\nwhat really brought her here\n\nCuriosity.",
    "Yes I suppose so.",
    "Now Len ten me all about it.",
    "Im simply\ndying to hear.",
    "I sat down and recited faithfully all the happenings of the\nmorning\n\nGriselda\n\ninterpolating\n\nthe\n\nnarrative\n\nwith\n\nlittle\n\nexclamations of surprise and interest.",
    "So it was Anne Lawrence was after all along Not Lettice.",
    "How\nblind weve all been That must have been what old Miss Marple\nwas hinting at yesterday.",
    "Dont you think so\n\nYes I said averting my eyes.",
    "Mary entered.",
    "Theres a couple of men here \u2014 come from a newspapers so\nthey say.",
    "Do you want to see them\n\nNo I said certainly not.",
    "Refer them to Inspector Slack at the\npolice station.",
    "Mary nodded and turned away.",
    "And when youve got rid of them I said come back here.",
    "Theres something I want to ask you.",
    "Mary nodded again.",
    "It was some few minutes before she returned.",
    "Had a job getting rid of them she said.",
    "Persistent.",
    "You never\nsaw anything like it.",
    "Wouldnt take no for an answer.",
    "I expect we shall be a good deal troubled with them I said.",
    "Now Mary what I want to ask you is this Are you quite certain\nyou didnt hear the shot yesterday evening\n\nThe shot what killed him No of course I didnt.",
    "If I had of done\nI should have gone in to see what had happened.",
    "Yes but \u2014 I was remembering Miss Marples statement that\nshe had heard a shot in the wood.",
    "I changed the form of my\nquestion.",
    "Did you hear any other shot \u2014 one down in the wood\nfor instance\n\n\fOh that.",
    "The girl paused.",
    "Yes now I come to think of it I\nbelieve I did.",
    "Not a lot of shots just one.",
    "Queer sort of bang it\nwas.",
    "Exactly I said.",
    "Now what time was that\n\nTime\n\nYes time.",
    "I couldnt say Im sure.",
    "Well after teatime.",
    "I do know that.",
    "Cant you get a little nearer than that\n\nNo I cant.",
    "Ive got my work to do havent I I cant go on\nlooking at clocks the whole time \u2014 and it wouldnt be much good\nanyway \u2014 the alarm loses a good threequarters every day and\nwhat with putting it on and one thing and another Im never\nexactly sure what time it is.",
    "This perhaps explains why our meals are never punctual.",
    "They\nare sometimes too late and sometimes bewilderingly early.",
    "Was it long before Mr. Redding came\n\nNo it wasnt long.",
    "Ten minutes \u2014 a quarter of an hour \u2014 not\nlonger than that.",
    "I nodded my head satisfied.",
    "Is that all said Mary.",
    "Because what I mean to say is Ive got\nthe joint in the oven and the pudding boiling over as likely as\nnot.",
    "Thats all right.",
    "You can go.",
    "She left the room and I turned to Griselda.",
    "Is it quite out of the question to induce Mary to say sir or\nmaam\n\n\fI have told her.",
    "She doesnt remember.",
    "Shes just a raw girl\nremember\n\nI am perfectly aware of that I said.",
    "But raw things do not\nnecessarily remain raw for ever.",
    "I feel a tinge of cooking might\nbe induced in Mary.",
    "Well I dont agree with you said Griselda.",
    "You know how little\nwe can afford to pay a servant.",
    "If once we got her smartened up\nat all shed leave.",
    "Naturally.",
    "And get higher wages.",
    "But as long\nas Mary cant cook and has those awful manners well were\nsafe nobody else would have her.",
    "I perceived that my wifes methods of housekeeping were not so\nentirely haphazard as I had imagined.",
    "A certain amount of\nreasoning underlay them.",
    "Whether it was worth while having a\nmaid at the price of her not being able to cook and having a\nhabit of throwing dishes and remarks at one with the same\ndisconcerting abruptness was a debatable matter.",
    "And anyway continued Griselda you must make allowances\nfor her manners being worse than usual just now.",
    "You cant\nexpect her to feel exactly sympathetic about Colonel Protheroes\ndeath when he jailed her young man.",
    "Did he jail her young man\n\nYes for poaching.",
    "You know that man Archer.",
    "Mary has been\nwalking out with him for two years.",
    "I didnt know that.",
    "Darling Len you never know anything.",
    "Its queer I said that every one says the shot came from the\nwoods.",
    "I dont think its queer at all said Griselda.",
    "You see one so\noften does hear shots in the wood.",
    "So naturally when you do\nhear a shot you just assume as a matter of course that it is in the\nwoods.",
    "It probably just sounds a bit louder than usual.",
    "Of\n\n\fcourse if one were in the next room youd realize that it was in\nthe house but from Marys kitchen with the window right the\nother side of the house I dont believe youd ever think of such a\nthing.",
    "The door opened again.",
    "Colonel Melchetts back said Mary.",
    "And that police inspector\nwith him and they say theys be glad if youd join then.",
    "Theyre in\nthe study.",
    "Chapter XI\n\nI saw at a glance that Colonel Melchett and Inspector Slack had\nnot been seeing eye to eye about the case.",
    "Melchett looked\nflushed and annoyed and the inspector looked sulky.",
    "Im sorry to say said Melchett that Inspector Slack doesnt\nagree with me in considering young Redding innocent.",
    "If he didnt do it what does he go and say he did it for asked\nSlack sceptically.",
    "Mrs. Protheroe acted in an exactly similar fashion remember\nSlack.",
    "Thats different.",
    "Shes a woman and women act in that silly\nway.",
    "Im not saying she did it for a moment.",
    "She heard he was\naccused and she trumped up a story.",
    "Im used to that sort of\ngame.",
    "You wouldnt believe the fool things Ive known women do.",
    "But Reddings different.",
    "Hes got his head screwed on all right.",
    "And if he admits he did it well I say he did do it.",
    "Its his pistol \u2014\nyou cant get away from that.",
    "And thanks to this business of Mrs.\nProtheroe we know the motive.",
    "That was the weak point before\nbut now we know it \u2014 why the whole things plain sailing.",
    "You think he can have shot him earlier At sixthirty say\n\nHe cant have done that.",
    "Youve checked up his movements\n\nThe inspector nodded.",
    "He was in the village near the Blue Boar at ten past six.",
    "From\nthere he came along the back lane where you say the old lady\nnext door saw him \u2014 she doesnt miss much I should say \u2014 and\nkept his appointment with Mrs. Protheroe in the studio in the\ngarden.",
    "They left there together just after sixthirty and went\nalong the lane to the village being joined by Dr. Stone.",
    "He\ncorroborates that all right \u2014 Ive seen him.",
    "They all stood talking\njust by the post office for a few minutes then Mrs. Protheroe\n\n\fwent into Miss Hartnells to borrow a gardening magazine.",
    "Thats\nall right too.",
    "Ive seen Miss Hartnell.",
    "Mrs. Protheroe remained\nthere talking to her till just on seven oclock when she exclaimed\nat the lateness of the hour and said she must get home.",
    "What was her manner\n\nVery easy and pleasant Miss Hartnell said.",
    "She seemed in good\nspirits \u2014 Miss Hartnell is quite sure there was nothing on her\nmind.",
    "Well go on.",
    "Redding he went with Dr. Stone to the Blue Boar and they had\na drink together.",
    "He left there at twenty minutes to seven went\nrapidly along the village street and down the road to the\nVicarage.",
    "Lots of people saw him.",
    "Not down the back lane this time commented the colonel.",
    "No \u2014 he came to the front asked for the vicar heard Colonel\nProtheroe was there went in \u2014 and shot him \u2014 just as he said\nhe did Thats the truth of it and we neednt look further.",
    "Melchett shook his head.",
    "Theres the doctors evidence.",
    "You cant get away from that.",
    "Protheroe was shot not later than sixthirty.",
    "Oh doctors Inspector Slack looked contemptuous.",
    "If youre\ngoing to believe doctors.",
    "Take out all your teeth \u2014 thats what\nthey do nowadays \u2014 and then say theyre very sorry but all the\ntime it was appendicitis.",
    "Doctors\n\nThis isnt a question of diagnosis.",
    "Dr. Haydock was absolutely\npositive on the point.",
    "You cant go against the medical evidence\nSlack.",
    "And theres my evidence for what it is worth I said suddenly\nrecalling a forgotten incident.",
    "I touched the body and it was\ncold.",
    "That I can swear to.",
    "You see Slack said Melchett.",
    "Well of course if thats so.",
    "But there it was \u2014 a beautiful case.",
    "Mr. Redding only too anxious to be hanged so to speak.",
    "That in itself strikes me as a little unnatural observed Colonel\nMelchett.",
    "Well theres no accounting for tastes said the inspector.",
    "Theres a lot of gentlemen went a bit balmy after the war.",
    "Now I\nsuppose it means starting again at the beginning.",
    "He turned on\nme.",
    "Why you went out of your way to mislead me about the\nclock sir I cant think.",
    "Obstructing the ends of justice thats\nwhat that was.",
    "I tried to tell you on three separate occasions I said.",
    "And\neach time you shut me up and refused to listen.",
    "Thats just a way of speaking sir.",
    "You could have told me\nperfectly well if you had had a mind to.",
    "The clock and the note\n\n\fseemed to tally perfectly.",
    "Now according to you the clock was\nall wrong.",
    "I never knew such a case.",
    "Whats the sense of keeping\na clock a quarter of an hour fast anyway\n\nIt is supposed I said to induce punctuality.",
    "I dont think we need go further into that now Inspector said\nColonel Melchett tactfully.",
    "What we want now is the true story\nfrom both Mrs. Protheroe and young Redding.",
    "I telephoned to\nHaydock and asked him to bring Mrs. Protheroe over here with\nhim.",
    "They ought to be here in about a quarter of an hour.",
    "I think it\nwould be as well to have Redding here first.",
    "Ill get on to the station said Inspector Slack and took up the\ntelephone.",
    "And now he said replacing the receiver well get to work on\nthis room.",
    "He looked at me in a meaning fashion.",
    "Perhaps I said youd like me out of the way.",
    "The inspector immediately opened the door for me.",
    "Melchett\ncalled out\n\nCome back when young Redding arrives will you Vicar Youre\na friend of his and you may have sufficient influence to\npersuaded him to speak the truth.",
    "I found my wife and Miss Marple with their heads together.",
    "Weve been discussing all sorts of possibilities said Griselda.",
    "I wish youd solve the case Miss Marple like you did the way\nMiss Wetherbys gill of picked shrimps disappeared.",
    "And all\nbecause it reminded you of something quite different about a\nsack of coals.",
    "Youre laughing my dear said Miss Marple but after all that\nis a very sound way of arriving at the truth.",
    "Its really what\npeople call intuition and make such a fuss about.",
    "Intuition is like\nreading a word without have to spell it out.",
    "A child cant do that\nbecause it has had so little experience.",
    "But a grownup person\n\n\fknows the word because theyve seen it often before.",
    "You catch\nmy meaning vicar\n\nYes I said slowly I think I do.",
    "You mean that if a thing reminds\nyou of something else \u2014 well its probably the same kind of\nthing.",
    "Exactly.",
    "And what precisely does the murder of Colonel Protheroe\nremind you of\n\nMiss Marple sighed.",
    "That is just the difficulty.",
    "So many parallels come to the mind.",
    "For instance there was Major Hargraves a churchwarden and a\nman highly respected in every way.",
    "And all the time he was\nkeeping\n\na\n\nseparate\n\nsecond\n\nestablishment\n\n\u2014\n\na\n\nformer\n\nhousemaid just think of it And five children \u2014 actually five\nchildren \u2014 a terrible shock to his wife and daughter.",
    "I tried hard to visualise Colonel Protheroe in the role of secret\nsinner and failed.",
    "And then there was that laundry business went on Miss\nMarple.",
    "Miss Hartnells opal pin \u2014 left most imprudently in a\nfrilled blouse and sent to the laundry.",
    "And the woman who took it\ndidnt want it in the least and wasnt by any means a thief.",
    "She\nsimply hid it in another womans house and told the police shed\nseen this other woman take it.",
    "Spite you know sheer spite.",
    "Its\nan astonishing motive \u2014 spite.",
    "A man in it of course.",
    "There\nalways is.",
    "This time I failed to see any parallel however remote.",
    "And then there was poor Elwells daughter \u2014 such a pretty\nethereal girl \u2014 tried to stifle her little brother.",
    "And there was the\nmoney for the Choir Boys Outing before your time vicar\nactually taken by the organist.",
    "His wife was sadly in debt.",
    "Yes\nthis case makes one think so many things \u2014 too many.",
    "Its very\nhard to arrive at the truth.",
    "I wish you would tell me I said who were the seven\nsuspects\n\nThe seven suspects\n\nYou said you could think of seven people who would \u2014 well be\nglad of Colonel Protheroes death.",
    "Did I Yes I remember I did.",
    "Was that true\n\nOh certainly it was true.",
    "But I mustnt mention names.",
    "You can\nthink of them quite easily yourself.",
    "I am sure.",
    "Indeed I cant.",
    "There is Lettice Protheroe I suppose since she\nprobably comes into money on her fathers death.",
    "But it is\nabsurd to think of her in such a connection and outside her I can\nthink of nobody.",
    "And you my dear said Miss Marple turning to Griselda.",
    "Rather to my surprise Griselda coloured up.",
    "Something very like\ntears started into her eyes.",
    "She clenched both her small hands.",
    "Oh she cried indignantly.",
    "People are hateful \u2014 hateful.",
    "The\nthings they say The beastly things they say .",
    ". .",
    "I looked at her curiously.",
    "It is very unlike Griselda to be so upset.",
    "She noticed my glance and tried to smile.",
    "Dont look at me as though I were an interesting specimen you\ndidnt understand Len Dont lets get heated and wander from\nthe point.",
    "I dont believe that it was Lawrence or Anne and\nLettice is out of the question.",
    "There must be some clue or other\nthat would help us.",
    "There is the note of course said Miss Marple.",
    "You will\nremember my saying this morning that that struck me as\nexceedingly peculiar.",
    "It seems to fix the time of his death with remarkable accuracy\nI said.",
    "And yet is that possible Mrs. Protheroe would only have\njust left the study.",
    "She would hardly have had time to reach the\nstudio.",
    "The only way in which I can account for it is that he\nconsulted his own watch and that his watch was slow.",
    "That\nseems to me a feasible solution.",
    "I have another idea said Griselda.",
    "Suppose Len that the\nclock had already been put back \u2014 no that comes to the same\nthing \u2014 how stupid of me\n\nIt hadnt been altered when I left I said.",
    "I remember\ncomparing it with my watch.",
    "Still as you say that has no bearing\non the present matter.",
    "What do you think Miss Marple asked Griselda.",
    "My dear I confess I wasnt thinking about it from that point of\nview at all.",
    "What strikes me as so curious and has done from the\nfirst is the subject matter of that letter.",
    "I dont see that I said.",
    "Colonel Protheroe merely wrote that he\ncouldnt wait any longer \u2014\n\nAt twenty minutes past six said Miss Marple.",
    "Your maid\nMary had already told him that you wouldnt be in till halfpast\nsix at the earliest and he had appeared to be quite willing to wait\nuntil then.",
    "And yet at twenty past six he sits down and says he\ncant wait any longer.",
    "I stared at the old lady feeling an increased respect for her\nmental powers.",
    "Her keen wits had seen what we had failed to\nperceive.",
    "It was an odd thing \u2014 a very odd thing.",
    "If only I said the letter hadnt been dated \u2014\n\nMiss Marple nodded her head.",
    "Exactly she said.",
    "If it hadnt been dated\n\nI cast my mind back trying to recall that sheet of notepaper and\nthe blurred scrawl and at the top that neatly printed 6.20.",
    "Surely\n\n\fthese figures were on a different scale to the rest of the letter.",
    "I\ngave a gasp.",
    "Supposing I said it wasnt dated.",
    "Supposing that round\nabout 6.30 Colonel Protheroe got impatient and sat down to say\nhe couldnt wait any longer.",
    "And as he was sitting there writing\nsomeone came in through the window \u2014\n\nOr through the door suggested Griselda.",
    "Hed hear the door and look up.",
    "Colonel Protheroe was rather deaf you remember said Miss\nMarple.",
    "Yes thats true.",
    "He wouldnt hear it.",
    "Whichever way the\nmurderer came he stole up behind the colonel and shot him.",
    "Then he saw the note and the clock and the idea came to him.",
    "He\nput 6.20 at the top of the letter and he altered the clock to 6.22.",
    "It\nwas a clever idea.",
    "It gave him or so he would think a perfect\nalibi.",
    "And what we want to find said Griselda is someone who has\na castiron alibi for 6.20 but no alibi at all for \u2014 well that isnt so\neasy.",
    "One cant fix the time.",
    "We can fix it within very narrow limits I said.",
    "Haydock places\n6.30 as the outside limit of time.",
    "I suppose one could perhaps\nshift it to 6.35 from the reasoning we have just been following\nout it seems clear that Protheroe would not have got impatient\nbefore 6.30.",
    "I think we can say we do know pretty well.",
    "Then that shot I heard \u2014 yes I suppose it is quite possible.",
    "And\nI thought nothing about it \u2014 nothing at all.",
    "Most vexing.",
    "And yet\nnow I try to recollect it does seem to me that it was different\nfrom the usual sort of shot one hears.",
    "Yes there was a\ndifference.",
    "Louder I suggested.",
    "No Miss Marple didnt think it had been louder.",
    "In fact she found\nit hard to say in what way it had been different but she still\ninsisted that it was.",
    "I thought she was probably persuading herself of the fact rather\nthan actually remembering it but she had just contributed such\na valuable new outlook to the problem that I felt highly respectful\ntowards her.",
    "She rose murmuring that she must really get back \u2014 it had been\nso tempting just to run over and discuss the case with dear\nGriselda.",
    "I escorted her to the boundary wall and the back gate\nand returned to find Griselda wrapped in thought.",
    "Still puzzling over that note I asked.",
    "No.",
    "She gave a sudden shiver and shook her shoulders impatiently.",
    "Len Ive been thinking.",
    "How badly someone must have hated\nAnne Protheroe\n\nHated her\n\nYes.",
    "Dont you see Theres no real evidence against Lawrence\n\u2014 all the evidence against him is what you might call accidental.",
    "He just happens to take it into his head to come here.",
    "If he hadnt\n\u2014 well no one would have thought of connecting him with the\ncrime.",
    "But Anne is different.",
    "Suppose someone knew that she\nwas here at exactly 6.20 \u2014 the clock and the time on the letter \u2014\neverything pointing to her.",
    "I dont think it was only because of an\nalibi it was moved to that exact time \u2014 I think there was more in\nit than that \u2014 a direct attempt to fasten the business on her.",
    "If it\nhadnt been for Miss Marple saying she hadnt got the pistol with\nher and noticing that she was only a moment before going down\nto the studio \u2014 Yes if it hadnt been for that .",
    ". . She shivered\nagain.",
    "Len I feel that someone hated Anne Protheroe very\nmuch.",
    "I \u2014 I dont like it.",
    "Chapter XII\n\nI was summoned to the study when Lawrence Redding arrived.",
    "He looked haggard and I thought suspicious.",
    "Colonel Melchett\ngreeted him with something approaching cordiality.",
    "We want to ask you a few questions \u2014 here on the spot he\nsaid.",
    "Lawrence sneered slightly.",
    "Isnt that a French idea Reconstruction of the crime\n\nMy dear boy said Colonel Melchett dont take that tone with\nus.",
    "Are you aware that someone else has also confessed to\ncommitting the crime which you pretend to have committed\n\n\fThe effect of these words on Lawrence was painful and\nimmediate.",
    "Ssomeone else he stammered.",
    "Who \u2014 who\n\nMrs. Protheroe said Colonel Melchett watching him.",
    "Absurd.",
    "She never did it.",
    "She couldnt have.",
    "Its impossible.",
    "Melchett interrupted him.",
    "Strangely enough we did not believe her story.",
    "Neither I may\nsay do we believe yours.",
    "Dr. Haydock says positively that the\nmurder could not have been committed at the time you say it\nwas.",
    "Dr. Haydock says that\n\nYes so you see you are cleared whether you like it or not.",
    "And\nnow we want you to help us to tell us exactly what occurred.",
    "Lawrence still hesitated.",
    "Youre not deceiving me about \u2014 about Mrs. Protheroe You\nreally dont suspect her\n\nOn my word of honour said Colonel Melchett.",
    "Lawrence drew a deep breath.",
    "Ive been a fool he said.",
    "An absolute fool.",
    "How could I have\nthought for one minute that she did it \u2014\n\nSuppose you tell us all about it suggested the Chief\nConstable.",
    "Theres not much to tell.",
    "I \u2014 I met Mrs. Protheroe that afternoon\n\u2014 He paused.",
    "We know all about that said Melchett.",
    "You may think that your\nfeeling for Mrs. Protheroe and hers for you was a dead secret\n\n\fbut in reality it was known and commented upon.",
    "In any case\neverything is bound to come out now.",
    "Very well then.",
    "I expect you are right.",
    "I had promised the vicar\nhere he glanced at me to \u2014 to go right away.",
    "I met Mrs.\nProtheroe that evening in the studio at a quarterpast six.",
    "I told\nher of what I had decided.",
    "She too agreed that it was the only\nthing to do.",
    "We \u2014 we said goodbye to each other.",
    "We left the studio and almost at once Dr. Stone joined us.",
    "Anne\nmanaged to seem marvellously natural.",
    "I couldnt do it.",
    "I went off\nwith Stone to the Blue Boar and had a drink.",
    "Then I thought Id go\nhome but when I got to the corner of this road I changed my\nmind and decided to come along and see the vicar.",
    "I felt I wanted\nsomeone to talk to about the matter.",
    "At the door the maid told me the vicar was out but would be in\nshortly but that Colonel Protheroe was in the study waiting for\nhim.",
    "Well I didnt like to go away again \u2014 looked as though I\nwere shirking meeting him.",
    "So I said Id visit too and I went into\nthe study.",
    "He stopped.",
    "Well said Colonel Melchett.",
    "Protheroe was sitting at the writing table \u2014 just as you found\nhim.",
    "I went up to him \u2014 touched him.",
    "He was dead.",
    "Then I looked\ndown and saw the pistol lying on the floor beside him.",
    "I picked it\nup \u2014 and at once saw that it was my pistol.",
    "That gave me a turn.",
    "My pistol And then straightaway I leaped\nto one conclusion.",
    "Anne must have bagged my pistol some time\nor other \u2014 meaning it for herself if she couldnt bear things any\nlonger.",
    "Perhaps she had had it with her today.",
    "After we parted\nin the village she must have come back here and \u2014 and \u2014 oh I\nsuppose I was mad to think of it.",
    "But thats what I thought.",
    "I\nslipped the pistol in my pocket and came away.",
    "Just outside the\nVicarage gate I met the vicar.",
    "He said something nice and\nnormal about seeing Protheroe \u2014 suddenly I had a wild desire to\nlaugh.",
    "His manner was so ordinary and everyday and there was I\nall strung up.",
    "I remember shouting out something absurd and\n\n\fseeing his face change.",
    "I was nearly off my head I believe.",
    "I\nwent walking \u2014 walking \u2014 at last I couldnt bear it any longer.",
    "If\nAnne had done this ghastly thing I was at least morally\nresponsible.",
    "I went and gave myself up.",
    "There was a silence when he had finished.",
    "Then the colonel said\nin a businesslike voice\n\nI would like to ask just one or two questions.",
    "First did you touch\nor move the body in any way\n\nNo I didnt touch it at all.",
    "One could see he was dead without\ntouching him.",
    "Did you notice a note lying on the blotter half concealed by his\nbody\n\nNo.",
    "Did you interfere in any way with the clock\n\n\fI never touched the clock.",
    "I seem to remember a clock lying\noverturned on the table but I never touched it.",
    "Now as to this pistol of yours when did you last see it\n\nLawrence Redding reflected.",
    "Its hard to say exactly.",
    "Where do you keep it\n\nOh in a litter of odds and ends in the sittingroom in my cottage.",
    "On one of the shelves of the bookcase.",
    "You left it lying about carelessly\n\nYes.",
    "I really didnt think about it.",
    "It was just there.",
    "So that any one who came to your cottage could have seen it\n\nYes.",
    "And you dont remember when you last saw it\n\n\fLawrence drew his brows together in a frown of recollection.",
    "Im almost sure it was there the day before yesterday.",
    "I\nremember pushing it aside to get an old pipe.",
    "I think it was the\nday before yesterday \u2014 but it may have been the day before\nthat.",
    "Who has been to your cottage lately\n\nOh crowds of people.",
    "Someone is always drifting in and out I\nhad a sort of tea party the day before yesterday.",
    "Lettice\nProtheroe Dennis and all their crowd.",
    "And then one or other of\nthe old Pussies comes in now and again.",
    "Do you lock the cottage up when you go out\n\nNo why on earth should I Ive nothing to steal.",
    "And no one\ndoes lock their houses up round here.",
    "Who looks after your wants there\n\n\fAn old Mrs. Archer comes in every morning to do for me as its\ncalled.",
    "Do you think she would remember when the pistol was there\nlast\n\nI dont know.",
    "She might.",
    "But I dont fancy conscientious dusting\nis her strong point.",
    "It comes to this \u2014 that almost any one might have taken that\npistol\n\nIt seems so \u2014 yes.",
    "The door opened and Dr. Haydock came in with Anne Protheroe.",
    "She started at seeing Lawrence.",
    "He on his part made a\ntentative step towards her.",
    "Forgive me Anne he said.",
    "It was abominable of me to think\nwhat I did.",
    "I \u2014 She faltered then looked appealingly at Colonel Melchett.",
    "It is true what Dr. Haydock told me\n\nThat Mr. Redding is cleared of suspicion Yes.",
    "And now what\nabout this story of yours Mrs. Protheroe Eh what about it\n\nShe smiled rather shamefacedly.",
    "I suppose you think it dreadful of me\n\nWell shall we say \u2014 very foolish But thats all over.",
    "What I\nwant now Mrs. Protheroe is the truth \u2014 the absolute truth.",
    "She nodded gravely.",
    "I will tell you.",
    "I suppose you know about \u2014 about everything.",
    "Yes.",
    "I was to meet Lawrence \u2014 Mr. Redding \u2014 that evening at the\nstudio.",
    "At a quarter past six.",
    "My husband and I drove into the\nvillage together.",
    "I had some shopping to do.",
    "As we parted he\nmentioned casually that he was going to see the vicar.",
    "I couldnt\nget word to Lawrence and I was rather uneasy.",
    "I \u2014 well it was\nawkward meeting him in the Vicarage garden whilst my husband\nwas at the Vicarage.",
    "Her cheeks burned as she said this.",
    "It was not a pleasant\nmoment for her.",
    "I reflected that perhaps my husband would not stay very long.",
    "To find this out I came along the back lane and into the garden.",
    "I\nhoped no one would see me but of course old Miss Marple had\nto be in her garden She stopped me and we said a few words\nand I explained I was going to call for my husband.",
    "I felt I had to\nsay something.",
    "I dont know whether she believed me or not.",
    "She\nlooked rather \u2014 funny.",
    "When I left her I went straight across to the Vicarage and\nround the corner of the house to the study window.",
    "I crept up to\nit very softly expecting to hear the sound of voices.",
    "But to my\nsurprise there were none.",
    "I just glanced in saw the room was\nempty and hurried across the lawn and down to the studio\nwhere Lawrence joined me almost at once.",
    "You say the room was empty Mrs. Protheroe\n\nYes my husband was not there.",
    "Extraordinary.",
    "You mean maam that you didnt see him said the inspector.",
    "No I didnt see him.",
    "Inspector Slack whispered to the Chief Constable who nodded.",
    "Do you mind Mrs. Protheroe just showing us exactly what you\ndid\n\n\fNot at all.",
    "She rose Inspector Slack pushed opened the window for her\nand she stepped out on the terrace and round the house to the\nleft.",
    "Inspector Slack beckoned me imperiously to go and sit at the\nwritingtable.",
    "Somehow\n\nI didnt\n\nmuch like doing it.",
    "It gave me an\n\nuncomfortable feeling.",
    "But of course I complied.",
    "Presently I heard footsteps outside they paused for a minute\nthen retreated.",
    "Inspector Slack indicated to me that I could\nreturn to the other side of the room.",
    "Mrs. Protheroe reentered\nthrough the window.",
    "Is that exactly how it was asked Colonel Melchett.",
    "I think exactly.",
    "Then can you tell us Mrs. Protheroe just exactly where the\nvicar was in the room when you looked in asked Inspector\nSlack.",
    "The vicar I \u2014 no Im afraid I cant.",
    "I didnt see him.",
    "Inspector Slack nodded.",
    "Thats how you didnt see your husband.",
    "He was round the\ncorner at the writingdesk.",
    "Oh she paused.",
    "Suddenly her eyes grew round with horror.",
    "It\nwasnt there that \u2014 that \u2014\n\nYes Mrs. Protheroe.",
    "It was while he was sitting there.",
    "Oh She quivered.",
    "He went on with his questions.",
    "Did you know Mrs. Protheroe that Mr. Redding had a pistol\n\nYes.",
    "He told me so once.",
    "Did you ever have that pistol in your possession\n\nShe shook her head.",
    "No.",
    "Did you know where he kept it\n\nIm not sure.",
    "I think \u2014 yes I think Ive seen it on a shelf in his\ncottage.",
    "Didnt you keep it there Lawrence\n\nWhen was the last time you were at the cottage Mrs.\nProtheroe\n\nOh about three weeks ago.",
    "My husband and I had tea there\nwith him.",
    "And you have not been there since\n\n\fNo.",
    "I never went there.",
    "You see it would probably cause a lot of\ntalk in the village.",
    "Doubtless said Colonel Melchett dryly.",
    "Where were you in the\nhabit of seeing Mr. Redding if I may ask\n\nHe used to come up to the Hall.",
    "He was painting Lettice We \u2014\nwe often met in the woods afterwards.",
    "Colonel Melchett nodded.",
    "Isnt that enough Her voice was suddenly broken.",
    "Its so\nawful \u2014 having to tell you all these things.",
    "And \u2014 and there\nwasnt anything wrong about it.",
    "There wasnt \u2014 indeed there\nwasnt.",
    "We were just friends.",
    "We \u2014 we couldnt help caring for\neach other.",
    "She looked pleadingly at Dr. Haydock and that softhearted man\nstepped forward.",
    "I really think Melchett he said that Mrs. Protheroe has had\nenough.",
    "Shes had a great shock \u2014 in more ways than one.",
    "The Chief Constable nodded.",
    "There is really nothing more I want to ask you Mrs. Protheroe\nhe said.",
    "Thank you for answering my questions so frankly.",
    "Then \u2014 then I may go\n\nIs your wife in asked Haydock.",
    "I think Mrs. Protheroe would\nlike to see her.",
    "Yes I said Griselda is in.",
    "Youd find her in the drawingroom.",
    "She and Haydock left the room together and Lawrence Redding\nwith them.",
    "Colonel Melchett had pursed up his lips and was playing with a\npaper knife.",
    "Slack was looking at the note.",
    "It was then that I\nmentioned Miss Marples theory.",
    "Slack looked closely at it.",
    "My word he said I believe the old ladys right.",
    "Look here sir\ndont you see \u2014 these figures are written in different ink.",
    "That\ndate was written with a fountain pen or Ill eat my boots\n\nWe were all rather excited.",
    "Youve examined the note for fingerprints of course said the\nChief Constable.",
    "What do you think colonel No fingerprints on the note at all.",
    "Fingerprints on the pistol those of Mr. Lawrence Redding.",
    "May\nhave been some others once before he went tooling round with\nit and carrying it around in his pocket but theres nothing clear\nenough to get hold of now.",
    "At first the case looked very black against Mrs. Protheroe said\nthe colonel thoughtfully.",
    "Much blacker than against young\nRedding.",
    "There was that old woman Marples evidence that she\ndidnt have the pistol with her but these elderly ladies are often\nmistaken.",
    "I was silent but I did not agree with him.",
    "I was quite sure that\nAnne Protheroe had had no pistol with her since Miss Marple had\nsaid so.",
    "Miss Marple is not the type of elderly lady who makes\nmistakes.",
    "She has got an uncanny knack of being always right.",
    "What did get me was that nobody heard the shot.",
    "If it was fired\nthen \u2014 somebody must have heard it \u2014 wherever they thought it\ncame from.",
    "Slack youd better have a word with the maid.",
    "Inspector Slack moved with alacrity towards the door.",
    "I shouldnt ask her if she heard a shot in the house I said.",
    "Because if you do shell deny it.",
    "Call it a shot in the wood.",
    "Thats the only kind of shot shed admit to hearing.",
    "I know how to manage them said Inspector Slack and\ndisappeared.",
    "Miss Marple says she heard a shot later said Colonel Melchett\nthoughtfully.",
    "We must see if she can fix the time at all precisely.",
    "Of course it may be a stray shot that had nothing to do with the\ncase.",
    "It may be of course I agreed.",
    "The colonel took a turn or two up and down the room.",
    "Do you know Clement he said suddenly Ive a feeling that\nthis is going to turn out a much more intricate and difficult\nbusiness than any of us think.",
    "Dash it all theres something\nbehind it.",
    "He snorted.",
    "Something we dont know about.",
    "Were\nonly beginning Clement.",
    "Mark my words were only beginning.",
    "All these things the clock the note the pistol \u2014 they dont make\nsense as they stand.",
    "I shook my head.",
    "They certainly didnt.",
    "But Im going to get to the bottom of it.",
    "No calling in of Scotland\nYard.",
    "Slacks a smart man.",
    "Hes a very smart man.",
    "Hes a kind of\nferret.",
    "Hell nose his way through to the truth.",
    "Hes done several\nvery good things already and this case will be his chef d\u0153uvre.",
    "Some men would call in Scotland Yard.",
    "I shant.",
    "Well get to the\nbottom of this here in Downshire.",
    "I hope so Im sure I said.",
    "I tried to make my voice enthusiastic but I had already taken\nsuch a dislike to Inspector Slack that the prospect of his success\nfailed to appeal to me.",
    "A successful Slack would I thought be\neven more odious than a baffled one.",
    "Who has the house next door asked the Colonel suddenly.",
    "You mean at the end of the road Mrs. Price Ridley.",
    "Well go along to her after Slack has finished with your maid.",
    "She might just possibly have heard something.",
    "She isnt deaf or\nanything is she\n\nI should say her hearing was remarkably keen.",
    "Im going by the\namount of scandal she has started by just happening to\noverhear accidentally.",
    "Thats the kind of woman we want.",
    "Oh heres Slack.",
    "The inspector had the air of one emerging from a severe tussle.",
    "Phew he said.",
    "Thats a tartar youve got sir.",
    "Mary is essentially a girl of strong character I replied.",
    "Doesnt like the police he said.",
    "I cautioned her \u2014 did what I\ncould to put the fear of the law into her but no good.",
    "She stood\nright up to me.",
    "Spirited I said feeling more kindly towards Mary.",
    "But I pinned her down all right.",
    "She heard one shot \u2014 and one\nshot only.",
    "And it was a good long time after Colonel Protheroe\ncame.",
    "I couldnt get her to name a time but we fixed it at last by\nmeans of the fish.",
    "The fish was late and she blew the boy up\nwhen he came and he said it was barely halfpast six anyway\nand it was just after that she heard the shot.",
    "Of course thats not\naccurate so to speak but it gives us an idea.",
    "Hm said Melchett.",
    "I dont think Mrs. Protheroes in this after all said Slack\n\nWith a note of regret in his voice.",
    "She wouldnt have had time to\nbegin with and then women never like fiddling about with\nfirearms.",
    "Arsenics more in their line.",
    "No I dont think she did it.",
    "Its a pity He sighed.",
    "Melchett explained that he was going round to Mrs. Price\nRidleys and Slack approved.",
    "May I come with you I asked.",
    "Im getting interested.",
    "I was given permission and we set forth.",
    "A loud Hie greeted us\nas we emerged from the Vicarage gate and my nephew Dennis\ncame running up the road from the village to join us.",
    "Look here he said to the inspector what about that footprint I\ntold you about\n\n\fGardeners said Inspector Slack laconically.",
    "You dont think it might be someone else wearing the\ngardeners boots\n\nNo I dont said Inspector Slack in a discouraging way.",
    "It would take more than that to discourage Dennis however.",
    "He held out a couple of burnt matches.",
    "I found these by the Vicarage gate.",
    "Thank you said Slack and put them in his pocket.",
    "Matters appeared now to have reached a deadlock.",
    "Youre not arresting Uncle Len are you inquired Dermis\nfacetiously.",
    "Why should I inquired Slack.",
    "Theres a lot of evidence against him declared Dennis.",
    "You\nask Mary.",
    "Only the day before the murder he was wishing\nColonel Protheroe out of the world.",
    "Werent you Uncle Len\n\nEr \u2014 I began.",
    "Inspector Slack turned a slow suspicious stare upon me and I\nfelt hot all over.",
    "Dennis is exceedingly tiresome.",
    "He ought to\nrealise that a policeman seldom has a sense of humour.",
    "Dont be absurd Dennis I said irritably.",
    "The innocent child opened his eyes in a stare of surprise.",
    "I say its only a joke he said.",
    "Uncle Len just said that any one\nwho murdered Colonel Protheroe would be doing the world a\nservice.",
    "Ah said Inspector Slack that explains something the maid\nsaid.",
    "Servants very seldom have any sense of humour either.",
    "I cursed\nDennis heartily in my mind for bringing the matter up.",
    "That and\nthe clock together will make the inspector suspicious of me for\nlife.",
    "Come on Clement said Colonel Melchett.",
    "Where are you going Can I come too asked Dennis.",
    "No you cant I snapped.",
    "We left him looking after us with a hurt expression.",
    "We went up\nto the neat front door of Mrs. Price Ridleys house and the\ninspector knocked and rang in what I can only describe as an\nofficial manner.",
    "A pretty parlourmaid answered the bell.",
    "Mrs. Price Ridley in inquired Melchett.",
    "No sir.",
    "The maid paused and added Shes just gone down to\nthe police station.",
    "This was a totally unexpected development.",
    "As we retraced our\nsteps Melchett caught me by the arm and murmured\n\nIf shes gone to confess to the crime too I really shall go off my\nhead.",
    "Chapter XIII\n\nI hardly thought it likely that Mrs. Price Ridley had anything so\ndramatic in view but I did wonder what had taken her to the\npolice station.",
    "Had she really got evidence of importance or that\n\n\fshe thought of importance to offer At any rate we should soon\nknow.",
    "We found Mrs. Price Ridley talking at a high rate of speed to a\nsomewhat bewilderedlooking police constable.",
    "That she was\nextremely indignant I knew from the way the bow in her hat was\ntrembling.",
    "Mrs. Price Ridley wears what I believe are known as\nHats for Matrons \u2014 they make a speciality of them in our\nadjacent town of Much Benham.",
    "They perch easily on a\nsuperstructure of hair and are somewhat overweighted with\nlarge bows of ribbon.",
    "Griselda is always threatening to get a\nmatrons hat.",
    "Mrs. Price Ridley paused in her flow of words upon our entrance.",
    "Mrs. Price Ridley inquired Colonel Melchett lifting his hat.",
    "Let me introduce Colonel Melchett to you Mrs. Price Ridley I\nsaid.",
    "Colonel Melchett is our Chief Constable.",
    "Mrs. Price Ridley looked at me coldly but produced the\nsemblance of a gracious smile for the colonel.",
    "Weve just been round to your house Mrs. Price Ridley\nexplained the colonel and heard you had come down here.",
    "Mrs. Price Ridley thawed altogether.",
    "Ah she said Im glad some notice is being taken of the\noccurrence.",
    "Disgraceful I call it.",
    "Simply disgraceful.",
    "There is no doubt that murder is disgraceful but it is not the\nword I should use to describe it myself.",
    "It surprised Melchett too\nI could see.",
    "Have you any light to throw upon the matter he asked.",
    "Thats your business.",
    "Its the business of the police.",
    "What do we\npay rates and taxes for I should like to know\n\nOne wonders how many times that query is uttered in a year\n\n\fWere doing our best Mrs. Price Ridley said the Chief\nConstable.",
    "But the man here hadnt even heard of it till I told him about it\ncried the lady.",
    "We all looked at the constable.",
    "Lady been rung up on the telephone he said.",
    "Annoyed.",
    "Matter of obscene language I understand.",
    "Oh I see.",
    "The colonels brow cleared.",
    "Weve been talking at\ncross purposes.",
    "You came down here to make a complaint did\nyou\n\nMelchett is a wise man.",
    "He knows that when it is a question of an\nirate middleaged lady there is only one thing to be done \u2014 to\nlisten to her.",
    "When she has said all that she wants to say there is\na chance that she will listen to you.",
    "Mrs. Price Ridley surged into speech.",
    "Such disgraceful occurrences ought to be prevented.",
    "They\nought not to occur.",
    "To be rung up in ones own house and\ninsulted \u2014 yes insulted.",
    "Im not accustomed to such things\nhappening.",
    "Ever since the war there has been a loosening of\nmoral fibre.",
    "Nobody minds what they say and as to the clothes\nthey wear \u2014\n\nQuite\n\nsaid\n\nColonel\n\nMelchett\n\nhastily.",
    "What\n\nhappened\n\nexactly\n\nMrs. Price Ridley took breath and started again.",
    "I was rung up \u2014\n\nWhen\n\nYesterday afternoon \u2014 evening to be exact.",
    "About halfpast six.",
    "I went to the telephone suspecting nothing.",
    "Immediately I was\nfoully attacked threatened \u2014\n\n\fWhat actually was said\n\nMrs. Price Ridley got slightly pink.",
    "That I decline to state.",
    "Obscene language murmured the constable in a ruminative\nbass.",
    "Was bad language used asked Colonel Melchett\n\nIt depends on what you call bad language.",
    "Could you understand it I asked.",
    "Of course I could understand it.",
    "Then it couldnt have been bad language I said.",
    "Mrs. Price Ridley looked at me suspiciously.",
    "A refined lady I explained is naturally unacquainted with bad\nlanguage.",
    "It wasnt that kind of thing said Mrs. Price Ridley.",
    "At first I\nmust admit I was quite taken in.",
    "I thought it was a genuine\nmessage.",
    "Then the \u2014 er \u2014 person became abusive.",
    "Abusive\n\nMost abusive.",
    "I was quite alarmed.",
    "Used threatening language eh\n\nYes.",
    "I am not accustomed to being threatened.",
    "What did they threaten you with Bodily damage\n\nNot exactly.",
    "Im afraid Mrs. Price Ridley you must be more explicit.",
    "In what\nway were you threatened\n\nThis Mrs. Price Ridley seemed singularly reluctant to answer.",
    "I cant remember exactly.",
    "It was all so upsetting.",
    "But right at the\nend \u2014 when I was really very upset this \u2014 this \u2014 wretch\nlaughed.",
    "Was it a mans voice or a womans\n\nIt was a degenerate voice said Mrs. Price Ridley with dignity.",
    "I can only describe it as a kind of perverted voice.",
    "Now gruff\nnow squeaky.",
    "Really a very peculiar voice.",
    "Probably a practical joke said the colonel soothingly.",
    "A most wicked thing to do if so.",
    "I might have had a heart\nattack.",
    "Well look into it said the colonel eh inspector Trace the\ntelephone call.",
    "You cant tell me more definitely exactly what was\nsaid Mrs. Price Ridley\n\nA struggle began in Mrs. Price Ridleys ample black bosom.",
    "The\ndesire for reticence fought against a desire for vengeance.",
    "Vengeance triumphed.",
    "This of course will go no further she began.",
    "Of course not.",
    "This creature began by saying \u2014 I can hardly bring myself to\nrepeat it \u2014\n\n Yes yes said Melchett encouragingly.",
    "You are a wicked scandalmongering old woman Me Colonel\nMelchett \u2014 a scandalmongering old woman.",
    "But this time\nyouve gone too far.",
    "Scotland Yard are after you for libel.",
    "Naturally you were alarmed said Melchett biting his\nmoustache to conceal a smile.",
    "Unless you hold your tongue in future it will be the worse for\nyou \u2014 in more ways than one.",
    "I cant describe to you the\nmenacing way that was said.",
    "I gasped Who are you faintly \u2014\nlike that and the voice answered The Avenger.",
    "I gave a little\nshriek.",
    "It sounded so awful and then \u2014 the person laughed.",
    "Laughed Distinctly.",
    "And that was all.",
    "I heard them hang up the\nreceiver.",
    "Of course I asked the exchange what number had been\nringing me up but they said they didnt know.",
    "You know what\nexchanges are.",
    "Thoroughly rude and unsympathetic.",
    "Quite I said.",
    "I felt quite faint continued Mrs. Price Ridley.",
    "All on edge and\nso nervous that when I heard a shot in the woods I do declare I\njumped almost out of my skin.",
    "That will show you.",
    "A shot in the woods said Inspector Slack alertly.",
    "In my excited state it simply sounded to me like a cannon going\noff.",
    "Oh I said and sank down on the sofa in a state of\nprostration.",
    "Clara had to bring me a glass of damson gin.",
    "Shocking said Melchett.",
    "Shocking.",
    "All very trying for you.",
    "And the shot sounded very loud you say As though it were near\nat hand\n\nThat was simply the state of my nerves.",
    "Of course.",
    "Of course.",
    "And what time was all this To help us in\ntracing the telephone call you know.",
    "About halfpast six.",
    "You cant give it us more exactly than that\n\nWell you see the little clock on my mantelpiece had just\nchimed the halfhour and I said Surely that clock is fast.",
    "It\ndoes gain that clock.",
    "And I compared it with the watch I was\nwearing and that only said ten minutes past but then I put it to\n\n\fmy ear and found it had stopped.",
    "So I thought Well if that clock\nis fast I shall hear the church tower in a moment or two.",
    "And\nthen of course the telephone bell rang and I forgot all about it.",
    "She paused breathless.",
    "Well that near enough said Colonel Melchett.",
    "Well have it\nlooked into for you Mrs. Price Ridley.",
    "Just think of it as a silly joke and dont worry Mrs. Price\nRidley I said.",
    "She looked at me coldly.",
    "Evidently the incident of the pound note\nstill rankled.",
    "Very strange things have been happening in this village lately\nshe said addressing herself to Melchett.",
    "Very strange things\nindeed.",
    "Colonel Protheroe was going to look into them and what\nhappened to him poor man Perhaps I shall be the next\n\nAnd on that she took her departure shaking her head with a kind\nof ominous melancholy.",
    "Melchett muttered under his breath No\n\n\fsuch luck.",
    "Then his face grew grave and he looked inquiringly\nat Inspector Slack.",
    "That worthy nodded his head slowly.",
    "This about settles it sir.",
    "Thats three people who heard the\nshot.",
    "Weve got to find out now who fired it.",
    "This business of Mr.\nReddings has delayed us.",
    "But weve got several starting points.",
    "Thinking Mr. Redding was guilty I didnt bother to look into them.",
    "But thats all changed now.",
    "And now one of the first things to do\nis to look up that telephone call.",
    "Mrs. Price Ridleys\n\nThe inspector grinned.",
    "No \u2014 though I suppose wed better make a note of that or else\nwe shall have the old girl bothering in here again.",
    "No I meant\nthat fake call that got the vicar out of the way.",
    "Yes said Melchett thats important.",
    "And the next thing is to find out what every one was doing that\nevening between six and seven.",
    "Every one at Old Hall I mean\nand pretty well every one in the village as well.",
    "I gave a sigh.",
    "What wonderful energy you have Inspector Slack.",
    "I believe in hard work.",
    "Well begin by just noting down your own\nmovements Mr. Clement.",
    "Willingly.",
    "The telephone call came through about halfpast five.",
    "A mans voice or a womans\n\nA womans.",
    "At least it sounded like a womans.",
    "But of course I\ntook it for granted it was Mrs. Abbott speaking.",
    "You didnt recognise it as being Mrs. Abbotts\n\n\fNo I cant say I did.",
    "I didnt notice the voice particularly or think\nabout it.",
    "And you started right away Walked Havent you got a\nbicycle\n\nNo.",
    "I see.",
    "So it took you \u2014 how long\n\nIts very nearly two miles whichever way you go.",
    "Through Old Hall woods is the shortest way isnt it\n\nActually yes.",
    "But its not particularly good going.",
    "I went and\ncame back by the footpath across the fields.",
    "The one that comes out opposite the Vicarage gate\n\nYes.",
    "And Mrs. Clement\n\nMy wife was in London.",
    "She arrived back by the 6.50 train.",
    "Right.",
    "The maid Ive seen.",
    "That finishes with the Vicarage.",
    "Ill be\noff to Old Hall next.",
    "And then I want an interview with Mrs.\nLestrange.",
    "Queer her going to see Protheroe the night before\nhe was killed.",
    "A lot of queer things about this case.",
    "I agreed.",
    "Glancing at the clock I realised that it was nearly lunch time I\ninvited Melchett to partake of pot luck with us but he excused\nhimself on the plea of having to go to the Blue Boar.",
    "The Blue\nBoar gives you a firstrate meal of the joint and twovegetable\ntype.",
    "I thought his choice was a wise one.",
    "After her interview\nwith the police Mary would probably be feeling more\ntemperamental than usual.",
    "Chapter XIV\n\nOn my way home I ran into Miss Hartnell and she detained me at\nleast ten minutes declaiming in her deep bass voice against the\nimprovidence and ungratefulness of the lower classes.",
    "The crux\nof the matter seemed to be that The Poor did not want Miss\nHartnell in their houses.",
    "My sympathies were entirely on their\nside.",
    "I am debarred by my social standing from expressing my\nprejudices in the forceful manner they do.",
    "I soothed her as best I could and made my escape.",

    "I complied.",
    "This is an extraordinary business he said as he threw his hat\non a chair and opened the door into his surgery.",
    "He sank down on a shabby leather chair and stared across the\nroom.",
    "He looked harried and perplexed.",
    "I told him that we had succeeded in fixing the time of the shot.",
    "He\nlistened with an almost abstracted air.",
    "That lets Anne Protheroe out he said.",
    "Well well Im glad its\nneither of those two.",
    "I like em both.",
    "I believed him and yet it occurred to me to wonder why since\nas he said he liked them both their freedom from complicity\nseemed to have had the result of plunging him in gloom.",
    "This\nmorning he had looked a man with a weight lifted from his mind\nnow he looked thoroughly rattled and upset.",
    "And yet I was convinced that he meant what he said.",
    "He was\nfond of both Anne Protheroe and Lawrence Redding.",
    "Why then\nthis gloomy absorption He roused himself with an effort.",

    "He recovered all right \u2014 as far as one ever\nrecovers.",
    "Its a strange disease \u2014 has a queer moral effect.",
    "The\nwhole character may change after it.",
    "He was silent for a moment or two and then said\n\n\fWe think with horror now of the days when we burnt witches I\nbelieve the day will come when we will shudder to think that we\never hanged criminals.",
    "You dont believe in capital punishment\n\nIts not so much that.",
    "He paused.",
    "You know he said slowly\nId rather have my job than yours.",
    "Why\n\nBecause your job deals very largely with what we call right and\nwrong \u2014 and Im not at all sure that theres any such thing.",

    "If by any chance you\nhappened to discover the truth \u2014 I wondered how you would feel\nabout it that was all.",
    "His anger died down.",
    "He stared once more straight ahead of him\nlike a man trying to read the answer to a riddle that perplexes\nhim yet which exists only in his own brain.",
    "If I suspected \u2014 if I knew \u2014 I should do my duty Clement.",
    "At\nleast I hope so.",
    "The question is which way would you consider your duty lay\n\nHe looked at me with inscrutable eyes.",
    "That question comes to every man some time in his life I\nsuppose Clement.",
    "And every man has to decide it in his own\nway.",
    "You dont know\n\nNo I dont know .",
    ". .",
    "I felt the best thing was to change the subject.",
    "That nephew of mine is enjoying this case thoroughly I said.",
    "Spends his entire time looking for footprints and cigarette ash.",
    "Haydock smiled.",
    "What age is he\n\nJust sixteen.",
    "You dont take tragedies seriously at that age.",
    "Its\nall Sherlock Holmes and Arsene Lupin to you.",
    "Haydock said thoughtfully\n\nHes a finelooking boy.",
    "What are you going to do with him\n\nI cant afford a University education Im afraid.",
    "The boy himself\nwants to go into the Merchant Service.",
    "He failed for the Navy.",
    "Well \u2014 its a hard life \u2014 but he might do worse.",
    "Yes he might do\nworse.",
    "I must be going I exclaimed catching sight of the clock.",
    "Im\nnearly half an hour late for lunch.",
    "My family were just sitting down when I arrived.",
    "They demanded\na full account of the mornings activities which I gave them\nfeeling as I did so that most of it was in the nature of an\nanticlimax.",
    "Dennis however was highly entertained by the history of Mrs.\nPrice Ridleys telephone call and went into fits of laughter as I\nenlarged upon the nervous shock her system had sustained and\nthe necessity for reviving her with damson gin.",
    "Serve the old cat right he exclaimed.",
    "Shes got the worst\ntongue in the place.",
    "I wish Id thought of ringing her up and\ngiving her a fright.",
    "I say Uncle Len what about giving her a\nsecond dose\n\n\fI hastily begged him to do nothing of the sort.",
    "Nothing is more\ndangerous than the wellmeant efforts of the younger generation\nto assist you and show their sympathy.",
    "Denniss mood changed suddenly.",
    "He frowned and put on his\nman of the world air.",
    "Ive been with Lettice most of the morning he said.",
    "You know\nGriselda shes really very worried.",
    "She doesnt want to show it\nbut she is.",
    "Very worried indeed.",
    "I should hope so said Griselda with a toss of her head.",
    "Griselda is not too fond of Lettice Protheroe.",
    "I dont think youre ever quite fair to Lettice.",
    "Dont you said Griselda\n\nLots of people dont wear mourning.",
    "Griselda was silent and so was I. Dennis continued\n\nShe doesnt talk to most people but she does talk to me.",
    "Shes\nawfully worried about the whole thing and she thinks something\nought to be done about it.",
    "She will find I said that Inspector Slack shares her opinion.",
    "He is going up to Old Hall this afternoon and will probably make\nthe life of everybody there quite unbearable to them in his efforts\nto get at the truth.",
    "What do you think is the truth Len asked my wife suddenly.",
    "Its hard to say my dear.",
    "I cant say that at the moment Ive any\nidea at all.",
    "Did you say that Inspector Slack was going to trace that\ntelephone call \u2014 the one that took you to the Abbotts\n\nYes.",
    "But can he do it Isnt it a very difficult thing to do\n\nI should not imagine so.",
    "The Exchange will have a record of the\ncalls.",
    "Oh My wife relapsed into thought.",
    "Uncle Len said my nephew why were you so ratty with me\nthis morning for joking about your wishing Colonel Protheroe to\nbe murdered\n\nBecause I said there is a time for everything.",
    "Inspector\nSlack has no sense of humour.",
    "He took your words quite\nseriously will probably crossexamine Mary and will get out a\nwarrant for my arrest.",
    "Doesnt he know when a fellows ragging\n\nNo I said he does not.",
    "He has attained to his present position\nthrough hard work and zealous attention to duty.",
    "That has left\nhim no time for the minor recreations of life.",
    "Do you like him Uncle Len\n\nNo I said I do not.",
    "From the first moment I saw him I disliked\nhim intensely.",
    "But I have no doubt that he is a highly successful\nman in his profession.",
    "You think hell find out who shot old Protheroe\n\nIf he doesnt I said it will not be for the want of trying.",
    "Mary appeared and said\n\nMr. Hawes wants to see you.",
    "Ive put him in the drawingroom\nand heres a note.",
    "Waiting for an answer.",
    "Verbal will do.",
    "I tore\nopen the note and read it.",
    "DEAR MR. CLEMENT \u2014 I should be so very grateful if you could\ncome and see me this afternoon as early as possible.",
    "I am in\ngreat trouble and would like your advice.",
    "Sincerely yours\n\nESTELLE LESTRANGE.",
    "Say I will come round in about half an hour I said to Mary.",
    "Then I went into the drawingroom to see Hawes.",
    "Chapter XV\n\nHawess appearance distressed me very much.",
    "His hands were\nshaking and his face kept twitching nervously.",
    "In my opinion he\nshould have been in bed and I told him so.",
    "He insisted that he\nwas perfectly well.",
    "I assure you sir I never felt better.",
    "Never in my life.",
    "This was obviously wide of the truth that I hardly knew how to\nanswer.",
    "I have a certain admiration for a man who will not give in\nto illness but Hawes was carrying the thing rather too far.",
    "I called to tell you how sorry I was that such a thing should\nhappen in the Vicarage.",
    "Yes I said its not very pleasant.",
    "Its terrible \u2014 quite terrible.",
    "It seems they havent arrested Mr.\nRedding after all\n\n\fNo.",
    "That was a mistake.",
    "He made \u2014 er \u2014 rather a foolish\nstatement.",
    "And the police are now quite convinced that he is innocent\n\nPerfectly.",
    "Why is that may I ask Is it \u2014 I mean do they suspect any one\nelse\n\nI should never have supected that Hawes would take such a\nkeen interest in the details of a murder case.",
    "Perhaps it is\nbecause it happened in the Vicarage.",
    "He appeared as eager as a\nreporter.",
    "I dont know that I am completely in Inspector Slacks\nconfidence.",
    "So far as I know he does not suspect any one in\nparticular.",
    "He is at present engaged in making inquiries.",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes \u2014 of course.",
    "But who can one imagine doing such a\ndreadful thing\n\nI shook my head.",
    "Colonel Protheroe was not a popular man I know that.",
    "But\nmurder For murder \u2014 one would need a very strong motive.",
    "So I should imagine I said.",
    "Who could have such a motive Have the police any idea\n\nI couldnt say.",
    "He might have made enemies you know.",
    "The more I think about\nit the more I am convinced that he was the kind of man to have\nenemies.",
    "He had a reputation on the Bench for being very\nsevere.",
    "I suppose he had.",
    "Why dont you remember sir He was telling you yesterday\nmorning about having been threatened by that man Archer.",
    "Now I come to think of it so he did I said.",
    "Of course I\nremember.",
    "You were quite near us at the time.",
    "Yes I overheard what he was saying.",
    "Almost impossible to help\nit with Colonel Protheroe.",
    "He had such a very loud voice hadnt\nhe I remember being impressed by your own words.",
    "That when\nhis time came he might have justice meted out to him instead of\nmercy.",
    "Did I say that I asked frowning.",
    "My remembrance of my own\nwords was slightly different.",
    "You said it very impressively sir.",
    "I was struck by your words.",
    "Justice is a terrible thing.",
    "And to think the poor man was struck\ndown shortly afterwards.",
    "Its almost as though you had a\npremonition.",
    "I had nothing of the sort I said shortly.",
    "I rather dislike Hawess\ntendency to mysticism.",
    "There is a touch of the visionary about\nhim.",
    "Have you told the police about this man Archer sir\n\nI know nothing about him.",
    "I mean have you repeated to them what Colonel Protheroe said\n\u2014 about Archer having threatened him.",
    "No I said slowly.",
    "I have not.",
    "But you are going to do so\n\nI was silent.",
    "I dislike hounding a man down who has already got\nthe forces of law and order against him.",
    "I held no brief for\nArcher.",
    "He is an inveterate poacher \u2014 one of those cheerful\nneerdoweels that are to be found in any parish.",
    "Whatever he\nmay have said in the heat of anger when he was sentenced I had\n\n\fno definite knowledge that he felt the same when he came out of\nprison.",
    "You heard the conversation I said at last.",
    "If you feel it your\nduty to go to the police with it you must do so.",
    "It would come better from you sir.",
    "Perhaps \u2014 but to tell the truth \u2014 well Ive no fancy for doing it.",
    "I might be helping to put the rope round the neck of an innocent\nman.",
    "But if he shot Colonel Protheroe \u2014\n\nOh if Theres no evidence of any kind that he did.",
    "His threats.",
    "Strictly speaking the threats were not his but Colonel\nProtheroes.",
    "Colonel Protheroe was threatening to show Archer\nwhat Vengeance was worth next time he caught him.",
    "I dont understand your attitude sir.",
    "Dont you I said wearily.",
    "Youre a young man.",
    "Youre zealous\nin the cause of right.",
    "When you get to my age youll find that you\nlike to give people the benefit of the doubt.",
    "Its not \u2014 I mean \u2014\n\nHe paused and I looked at him in surprise.",
    "You havent any \u2014 any idea of your own \u2014 as to the identity of\nthe murderer I mean\n\nGood heavens no.",
    "Hawes persisted.",
    "Or as to the \u2014 the motive\n\nNo.",
    "Have you\n\n\fI No indeed.",
    "I just wondered.",
    "If Colonel Protheroe had \u2014 had\nconfided in you in any way \u2014 mentioned anything .",
    ". .\n\nHis confidences such as they were were heard by the whole\nvillage street yesterday morning I said dryly.",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes of course.",
    "And you dont think \u2014 about Archer\n\nThe police will know all about Archer soon enough I said.",
    "If\nId heard him threaten Colonel Protheroe myself that would be a\ndifferent matter.",
    "But you may be sure that if he actually has\nthreatened him half the people in the village will have heard him\nand the news will get to the police all right.",
    "You of course must\ndo as you like about the matter.",
    "But Hawes seemed curiously unwilling to do anything himself.",
    "The mans whole attitude was nervous and queer.",
    "I recalled what\nHaydock had said about his illness.",
    "There I supposed lay the\nexplanation.",
    "He took his leave unwillingly as though he had more to say and\ndidnt know how to say it.",
    "Before he left I arranged with him to take the service for the\nMothers Union followed by the meeting of District Visitors.",
    "I had\nseveral projects of my own for the afternoon.",
    "Dismissing Hawes and his troubles from my mind I started off for\nMrs. Lestrange.",
    "On the table in the hall lay the Guardian and the Church Times\nunopened.",
    "As I walked I remembered that Mrs. Lestrange had had an\ninterview with Colonel Protheroe the night before his death.",
    "It\nwas possible that something had transpired in that interview\nwhich would throw light upon the problem of his murder.",
    "I was shown straight into the little drawingroom and Mrs.\nLestrange rose to meet me I was struck anew by the marvellous\natmosphere that this woman could create.",
    "She wore a dress of\n\n\fsome dead black material that showed off the extraordinary\nfairness of her skin.",
    "There was something curiously dead about\nher face.",
    "Only the eyes were burningly alive.",
    "There was a\nwatchful look in them today.",
    "Otherwise she showed no signs of\nanimation.",
    "It was very good of you to come Mr. Clement she said as she\nshook hands.",
    "I wanted to speak to you the other day.",
    "Then I\ndecided not to do so.",
    "I was wrong.",
    "As I told you then I shall be glad to do anything that can help\nyou.",
    "Yes you said that.",
    "And you said it as though you meant it.",
    "Very\nfew people Mr. Clement in this world have ever sincerely\nwished to help me.",
    "I can hardly believe that Mrs. Lestrange.",
    "It is true.",
    "Most people \u2014 most men at anyrate are out for their\nown hand.",
    "There was a bitterness in her voice.",
    "I did not answer and she went on\n\nSit down wont you\n\nI obeyed and she took a chair facing me.",
    "She hesitated a\nmoment and then began to speak very slowly and thoughtfully\nseeming to weigh each word as she uttered it.",
    "I am in a very peculiar position Mr. Clement and I want to ask\nyour advice.",
    "That is I want to ask your advice as to what I should\ndo next.",
    "What is past is past and cannot be undone.",
    "You\nunderstand\n\nBefore I could reply the maid who had admitted me opened the\ndoor and said with a scared face\n\nOh please maam there is a police inspector here and he says\nhe must speak to you please.",
    "There was a pause.",
    "Mrs. Lestranges face did not change.",
    "Only\nher eyes very slowly closed and opened again.",
    "She seemed to\nswallow once or twice then she said in exactly the same clear\ncalm voice Show him in Hilda.",
    "I was about to rise but she motioned me back again with an\nimperious hand.",
    "If you do not mind \u2014 I should be much obliged if you would\nstay.",
    "I resumed my seat.",
    "Certainly if you wish it I murmured as Slack entered with a\nbrisk regulation tread.",
    "Goodafternoon madam he began.",
    "Goodafternoon inspector.",
    "At this moment he caught sight of me and scowled.",
    "There is no\ndoubt about it Slack does not like me.",
    "You have no objection to the vicars presence I hope\n\nI suppose that Slack could not very well say he had.",
    "Noo he said grudgingly.",
    "Though perhaps it might be better\n\u2014\n\nMrs. Lestrange paid no attention to the hint.",
    "What can I do for you inspector she asked.",
    "Its this way madam.",
    "Murder of Colonel Protheroe.",
    "Im in\ncharge of the case and making inquiries.",
    "Mrs. Lestrange nodded.",
    "Just as a matter of form Im asking every one just where they\nwere yesterday evening between the hours of 6 and 7 p.m. Just\nas a matter of form you understand.",
    "Mrs. Lestrange did not seem in the least discomposed.",
    "You want to know where I was yesterday evening between six\nand seven\n\nIf you please madam.",
    "Let me see.",
    "She reflected a moment.",
    "I was here.",
    "In this\nhouse.",
    "Oh I saw the inspectors eyes flash.",
    "And your maid \u2014 you\nhave only one maid I think \u2014 can confirm that statement\n\nNo it was Hildas afternoon out.",
    "I see.",
    "So unfortunately you will have to take my word for it said\nMrs. Lestrange pleasantly.",
    "You seriously declare that you were at home all the afternoon\n\nYou said between six and seven inspector.",
    "I was out for a walk\nearly in the afternoon.",
    "I returned some time before five oclock.",
    "Then if a lady \u2014 Miss Hartnell for instance \u2014 were to declare\nthat she came here about six oclock rang the bell but could\nmake no one hear and was compelled to go away again \u2014 youd\nsay she was mistaken eh\n\nOh no Mrs. Lestrange shook her head.",
    "But \u2014\n\nIf your maid is in she can say not at home.",
    "If one is alone and\ndoes not happen to want to see callers \u2014 well the only thing to\ndo is to let them ring.",
    "Inspector Slack looked slightly baffled.",
    "Elderly women bore me dreadfully said Mrs. Lestrange.",
    "And\nMiss Hartnell is particularly boring.",
    "She must have rung at least\nhalf a dozen times before she went away.",
    "She smiled sweetly at Inspector Slack.",
    "The inspector shifted his ground.",
    "Then if any one were to say theyd seen you out and about then\n\u2014\n\nOh but they didnt did they She was quick to sense his weak\npoint.",
    "No one saw me out because I was in you see.",
    "Quite so madam.",
    "The inspector hitched his chair a little nearer.",
    "Now I understand Mrs. Lestrange that you paid a visit to\nColonel Protheroe at Old Hall the night before his death.",
    "Mrs. Lestrange said calmly That is so.",
    "Can you indicate to me the nature of that interview\n\nIt concerned a private matter inspector.",
    "Im afraid I must ask you to tell me the nature of that private\nmatter.",
    "I shall not tell you anything of the kind.",
    "I will only assure you that\nnothing which was said at that interview could possibly have any\nbearing upon the crime.",
    "I dont think you are the best judge of that.",
    "At anyrate you will have to take my word for it inspector.",
    "In fact I have to take your word about everything.",
    "It does seem rather like it she agreed still with the same\nsmiling calm.",
    "Inspector Slack grew very red.",
    "This is a serious matter Mrs. Lestrange.",
    "I want the truth \u2014 He\nbanged his fist down on a table.",
    "And I mean to get it.",
    "Mrs. Lestrange said nothing at all.",
    "Dont you see madam that youre putting yourself in a very\nfishy position\n\nStill Mrs. Lestrange said nothing.",
    "Youd be required to give evidence at the inquest.",
    "Yes.",
    "Just the monosyllable.",
    "Unemphatic uninterested.",
    "The inspector\naltered his tactics.",
    "You were acquainted with Colonel Protheroe\n\nYes I was acquainted with him.",
    "Well acquainted\n\nThere was a pause before she said\n\nI had not seen him for several years.",
    "You were acquainted with Mrs. Protheroe\n\nNo.",
    "Youd excuse me but it was a very unusual time to make a call.",
    "Not from my point of view.",
    "What do you mean by that\n\nI wanted to see Colonel Protheroe alone.",
    "I did not want to see\nMrs. Protheroe or Miss Protheroe.",
    "I considered this the best way\nof accomplishing my object.",
    "Why didnt you want to see Mrs. or Miss Protheroe\n\nThat inspector is my business.",
    "Then you refuse to say more\n\nAbsolutely.",
    "Inspector Slack rose.",
    "Youll be putting yourself in a nasty position madam if youre\nnot careful.",
    "All this looks bad \u2014 it looks very bad.",
    "She laughed.",
    "I could have told Inspector Slack that this was not\nthe kind of woman who is easily frightened.",
    "Well he said extricating himself with dignity dont say I\nhavent warned you thats all.",
    "Goodafternoon madam and\nmind you were going to get at the truth.",
    "He departed.",
    "Mrs. Lestrange rose and held out her hand.",
    "I am going to send you away \u2014 yes it is better so.",
    "You see it is\ntoo late for advice now.",
    "I have chosen my part.",
    "She repeated in a rather forlorn voice\n\nI have chosen my part.",
    "Chapter XVI\n\nAs I went out I ran into Haydock on the doorstep.",
    "He glanced\nsharply after Slack who was just passing through the gate and\ndemanded Has he been questioning her\n\nYes.",
    "Hes been civil I hope\n\nCivility to my mind is an art which Inspector Slack has never\nlearnt but I presumed that according to his own lights civil he\nhad been and anyway I didnt want to upset Haydock any\nfurther.",
    "He was looking worried and upset as it was.",
    "So I said he\nhad been quite civil.",
    "Haydock nodded and passed on into the house and I went on\ndown the village street where I soon caught up the inspector.",
    "I\nfancy that he was walking slowly on purpose.",
    "Much as he\n\n\fdislikes me he is not the man to let dislike stand in the way of\nacquiring any useful information.",
    "Do you know anything about the lady he asked me point\nblank.",
    "I said I knew nothing whatever.",
    "Shes never said anything about why she came here to live\n\nNo.",
    "Yet you go and see her\n\nIt is one of my duties to call on my parishioners I replied\nevading to remark that I had been sent for.",
    "Hm I suppose it is.",
    "He was silent for a minute or two and then\nunable to resist discussing his recent failure he went on Fishy\nbusiness it looks to me.",
    "You think so\n\nIf you ask me I say blackmail.",
    "Seems funny when you think of\nwhat Colonel Protheroe was always supposed to be.",
    "But there\nyou never can tell.",
    "He wouldnt be the first churchwarden whod\nled a double life.",
    "Faint remembrances of Miss Marples remarks on the same\nsubject floated through my mind.",
    "You really think thats likely\n\nWell it fits the facts sir.",
    "Why did a smart welldressed lady\ncome down to this quiet little hole Why did she go and see him\nat that funny time of day Why did she avoid seeing Mrs. and\nMiss Protheroe Yes it all hangs together.",
    "Awkward for her to\nadmit \u2014 blackmails a punishable offense.",
    "But well get the truth\nout of her.",
    "For all we know it may have a very important bearing\non the case.",
    "If Colonel Protheroe had some guilty secret in his\nlife \u2014 something disgraceful \u2014 well you can see for yourself\nwhat a field it opens up.",
    "I suppose it did.",
    "Ive been trying to get the butler to talk.",
    "He might have\noverheard some of the conversation between Colonel Protheroe\nand Lestrange.",
    "Butlers do sometimes.",
    "But he swears he hasnt\nthe least idea of what the conversation was about.",
    "By the way\nhe got the sack through it.",
    "The colonel went for him being angry\nat his having let her in.",
    "The butler retorted by giving notice.",
    "Says\nhe didnt like the place anyway and had been thinking of leaving\nfor some time.",
    "Really.",
    "So that gives us another person who had a grudge against the\ncolonel.",
    "You dont seriously suspect the man \u2014 whats his name by the\nway\n\n\fHis names Reeves and I dont say I do suspect him.",
    "What I say\nis you never know.",
    "I dont like that soapy oily manner of his.",
    "I wonder what Reeves would say of Inspector Slacks manner.",
    "Im going to question the chauffeur now.",
    "Perhaps then I said youll give me a lift in your car.",
    "I want a\nshort interview with Mrs. Protheroe.",
    "What about\n\nThe funeral arrangements.",
    "Oh Inspector Slack was slightly taken aback.",
    "The inquests\ntomorrow Saturday.",
    "Just so.",
    "The funeral will probably be arranged for Tuesday.",
    "Inspector Slack seemed to be a little ashamed of himself for his\nbrusqueness.",
    "He held out an olive branch in the shape of an\n\n\finvitation to be present at the interview with the chauffeur\nManning.",
    "Manning was a nice lad not more than twentyfive or six years of\nage.",
    "He was inclined to be awed by the inspector.",
    "Now then my lad said Slack I want a little information from\nyou.",
    "Yes sir stammered the chauffeur.",
    "Certainly sir.",
    "If he had committed the murder himself he could not have been\nmore alarmed.",
    "You took your master to the village yesterday\n\nYes sir.",
    "What time was that\n\nFivethirty.",
    "Mrs. Protheroe went too\n\nYes sir.",
    "You went straight to the village\n\nYes sir.",
    "You didnt stop anywhere on the way\n\nNo sir.",
    "What did you do when you got there\n\nThe colonel got out and told me he wouldnt want the car again.",
    "Hed walk home.",
    "Mrs. Protheroe had some shopping to do.",
    "The\nparcels were put in the car.",
    "Then she said that was all and I\ndrove home.",
    "Leaving her in the village\n\n\fYes sir.",
    "What time was that\n\nA quarter past six sir.",
    "A quarter past exactly.",
    "Where did you leave her\n\nBy the church sir.",
    "Had the colonel mentioned at all where he was going\n\nHe said something about having to see the vet .",
    ". . something to\ndo with one of the horses.",
    "I see.",
    "And you drove straight back here\n\nYes sir.",
    "There are two entrances to Old Hall by the South Lodge and by\nthe North Lodge.",
    "I take it that going to the village you would go\nby the South Lodge\n\nYes sir always.",
    "And you came back the same way\n\nYes sir.",
    "Hm.",
    "I think thats all.",
    "Ah heres Miss Protheroe.",
    "Lettice drifted towards us.",
    "I want the Fiat Manning she said.",
    "Start her for me will you\n\nVery good miss.",
    "He went towards a twoseater and lifted the bonnet.",
    "Just a minute Miss Protheroe said Slack.",
    "Its necessary that I\nshould have a record of everybodys movements yesterday\nafternoon.",
    "No offence meant.",
    "Lettice stared at him.",
    "I never know the time of anything she said.",
    "I understand you went out soon after lunch yesterday\n\nShe nodded.",
    "Where to please\n\nTo play tennis.",
    "Who with\n\nThe Hartley Napiers.",
    "At Much Benham\n\n\fYes.",
    "And you returned\n\nI dont know.",
    "I tell you I never know these things.",
    "You returned I said about seventhirty.",
    "Thats right said Lettice.",
    "In the middle of the shemozzle.",
    "Anne having fits and Griselda supporting her.",
    "Thank you miss said the inspector.",
    "Thats all I want to\nknow.",
    "How queer said Lettice.",
    "It seems so uninteresting.",
    "She moved towards the Fiat.",
    "The inspector touched his forehead in a surreptitious manner.",
    "A bit wanting he suggested.",
    "Not in the least I said.",
    "But she likes to be thought so.",
    "Well Im off to question the maids now.",
    "One cannot really like Slack but one can admire his energy.",
    "We parted company and I inquired of Reeves if I could see Mrs.\nProtheroe.",
    "She is lying down sir at the moment.",
    "Then Id better not disturb her.",
    "Perhaps if you would wait sir I know that Mrs. Protheroe is\nanxious to see you.",
    "She was saying as much at luncheon.",
    "He showed me into the drawingroom switching on the electric\nlights since the blinds were down.",
    "A very sad business all this I said.",
    "Yes sir.",
    "His voice was cold and respectful.",
    "I looked at him.",
    "What feelings were at work under that impassive\ndemeanour.",
    "Were there things that he knew and could have told\nus There is nothing so inhuman as the mask of the good\nservant.",
    "Is there anything more sir\n\nWas there just a hint of anxiety to be gone behind that correct\nexpression.",
    "Theres nothing more I said.",
    "I had a very short time to wait before Anne Protheroe came to\nme.",
    "We discussed and settled a few arrangements and then\n\nWhat a wonderfully kind man Dr. Haydock is she exclaimed.",
    "Haydock is the best fellow I know.",
    "He has been amazingly kind to me.",
    "But he looks very sad\ndoesnt he\n\nIt had never occurred to me to think of Haydock as sad.",
    "I turned\nthe idea over in my mind.",
    "I dont think Ive ever noticed it I said at last.",
    "I never have until today.",
    "Ones own troubles sharpen ones eyes sometimes I said.",
    "Thats very true.",
    "She paused and then said\n\nMr. Clement theres one thing I absolutely cannot make out.",
    "If\nmy husband were shot immediately after I left him how was it\nthat I didnt hear the shot\n\nThey have reason to believe that the shot was fired later.",
    "But the 6.20 on the note\n\n\fWas possibly added by a different hand \u2014 the murderers.",
    "Her cheek paled.",
    "How horrible\n\nIt didnt strike you that the date was not in his handwriting\n\nNone of it looked like his handwriting.",
    "There was some truth in this observation.",
    "It was a somewhat\nillegible scrawl not so precise as Protheroes writing usually\nwas.",
    "You are sure they dont still suspect Lawrence\n\nI think he is definitely cleared.",
    "But Mr. Clement who can it be Lucius was not popular I\nknow but I dont think he had any real enemies.",
    "Not \u2014 not that\nkind of enemy.",
    "I shook my head.",
    "Its a mystery.",
    "I thought wonderingly of Miss Marples seven suspects.",
    "Who\ncould they be\n\nAfter I took leave of Anne I proceeded to put a certain plan of\nmine into action.",
    "I returned from Old Hall by way of the private path.",
    "When I\nreached the stile I retraced my steps and choosing a place\nwhere I fancied the undergrowth showed signs of being\ndisturbed I turned aside from the path and forced my way\nthrough the bushes.",
    "The wood was a thick one with a good deal\nof tangled undergrowth.",
    "My progress was not very fast and I\nsuddenly became aware that someone else was moving amongst\nthe bushes not very far from me.",
    "As I paused irresolutely\n\n\fLawrence Redding came into sight.",
    "He was carrying a large\nstone.",
    "I suppose I must have looked surprised for he suddenly burst\nout laughing.",
    "No he said its not a clue its a peace offering.",
    "A peace offering\n\nWell a basis for negotiations shall we say I want an excuse for\ncalling on your neighbour Miss Marple and I have been told\nthere is nothing she likes so much as a nice bit of rock or stone\nfor the Japanese gardens she makes.",
    "Quite true I said.",
    "But what do you want with the old lady\n\nJust this.",
    "If there was anything to be seen yesterday evening\nMiss Marple saw it.",
    "I dont mean anything necessarily connected\nwith the crime \u2014 that she would think connected with the crime.",
    "I mean some outr\u00e9 or bizarre incident some simple little\n\n\fhappening that might give us a clue to the truth.",
    "Something that\nshe wouldnt think worth while mentioning to the police.",
    "Its possible I suppose.",
    "Its worth trying anyhow.",
    "Clement Im going to get to the bottom\nof this business.",
    "For Annes sake if nobodys else.",
    "And I havent\nany too much confidence in Slack \u2014 hes a zealous fellow but\nzeal cant really take the place of brains.",
    "I see I said that you are that favourite character of fiction\nthe amateur detective.",
    "I dont know that they really hold their\nown with the professional in real life.",
    "He looked at me shrewdly and suddenly laughed.",
    "What are you doing in the wood padre\n\nI had the grace to blush.",
    "Just the same as I am doing I dare swear.",
    "Weve got the same\nidea havent we How did the murderer come to the study First\nway along the lane and through the gate second way by the\nfront door third way \u2014 is there a third way My idea was to see\nif there was any signs of the bushes being disturbed or broken\nanywhere near the wall of the Vicarage garden.",
    "That was just my idea I admitted.",
    "I hadnt really got down to the job though continued\nLawrence.",
    "Because it occurred to me that Id like to see Miss\nMarple first to make quite sure that no one did pass along the\nlane yesterday evening whilst we were in the studio.",
    "I shook my head.",
    "She was quite positive that nobody did.",
    "Yes nobody whom she would call anybody \u2014 sounds mad but\nyou see what I mean.",
    "But there might have been someone like a\npostman or a milkman or a butchers boy \u2014 someone whose\n\n\fpresence would be so natural that you wouldnt think of\nmentioning it.",
    "Youve been reading G. K. Chesterton I said and Lawrence\ndid not deny it.",
    "But dont you think theres just possibly something in the idea\n\nWell I suppose there might be I admitted.",
    "Without further ado we made our way to Miss Marples.",
    "She was\nworking in the garden and called out to us as we climbed over\nthe stile.",
    "You see murmured Lawrence she sees everybody.",
    "She received us very graciously and was much pleased with\nLawrences immense rock which he presented with all due\nsolemnity.",
    "Its very thoughtful of you Mr. Redding.",
    "Very thoughtful\nindeed.",
    "Emboldened by this Lawrence embarked on his questions.",
    "Miss\nMarple listened attentively.",
    "Yes I see what you mean and I quite agree it is the sort of\nthing no one mentions or bothers to mention.",
    "But I can assure\nyou that there was nothing of the kind.",
    "Nothing whatever.",
    "You are sure Miss Marple\n\nQuite sure.",
    "Did you see any one go by the path into the wood that\nafternoon I asked.",
    "Or come from it\n\nOh yes quite a number of people.",
    "Dr. Stone and Miss Cram\nwent that way \u2014 its the nearest way to the Barrow for them.",
    "That was a little after two oclock.",
    "And Dr. Stone returned that\n\n\fway \u2014 as you know Mr. Redding since he joined you and Mrs.\nProtheroe.",
    "By the way I said.",
    "That shot \u2014 the one you heard Miss\nMarple.",
    "Mr. Redding and Mrs. Protheroe must have heard it too.",
    "I looked inquiringly at Lawrence.",
    "Yes he said frowning.",
    "I believe I did hear some shots.",
    "Werent there one or two shots\n\nI only heard one said Miss Marple.",
    "Its only the vaguest impression in my mind said Lawrence.",
    "Curse it all I wish I could remember.",
    "If only Id known.",
    "You see\nI was so completely taken up with \u2014 with \u2014\n\nHe paused embarrassed.",
    "I gave a tactful cough.",
    "Miss Marple with a touch of prudishness\nchanged the subject.",
    "Inspector Slack has been trying to get me to say whether I\nheard the shot after Mr. Redding and Mrs. Protheroe had left the\nstudio or before.",
    "Ive had to confess that I really could not say\ndefinitely but I have the impression \u2014 which is growing stronger\nthe more I think about it \u2014 that it was after.",
    "Then that lets the celebrated Dr. Stone out anyway said\nLawrence with a sigh.",
    "Not that there has ever been the\nslightest reason why he should be suspected of shooting old\nProtheroe.",
    "Ah said Miss Marple.",
    "But I always find it prudent to suspect\neverybody just a little.",
    "What I say is you really never know do\nyou\n\nThis was typical of Miss Marple.",
    "I asked Lawrence if he agreed\nwith her about the shot.",
    "I really cant say.",
    "You see it was such an ordinary sound.",
    "I\nshould be inclined to think it had been fired when we were in the\n\n\fstudio.",
    "The sound would have been deadened and \u2014 and one\nwould have noticed it less there.",
    "For other reasons than the sound being deadened I thought to\nmyself\n\nI must ask Anne said Lawrence.",
    "She may remember.",
    "By the\nway there seems to me to be one curious fact that needs\nexplanation.",
    "Mrs. Lestrange the Mystery Lady of St. Mary Mead\npaid a visit to old Protheroe after dinner on Wednesday night.",
    "And nobody seems to have any idea what it was all about.",
    "Old\nProtheroe said nothing to either his wife or Lettice.",
    "Perhaps the vicar knows said Miss Marple.",
    "Now how did the woman know that I had been to visit Mrs.\nLestrange that afternoon The way she always knows things is\nuncanny.",
    "I shook my head and said I could throw no light upon the matter.",
    "What does Inspector Slack think asked Miss Marple.",
    "Hes done his best to bully the butler \u2014 but apparently the\nbutler wasnt curious enough to listen at the door.",
    "So there it is\n\u2014 no one knows.",
    "I expect someone overheard something though dont you\nsaid Miss Marple.",
    "I mean somebody always does.",
    "I think that is\nwhere Mr. Redding might find out something.",
    "But Mrs. Protheroe knows nothing.",
    "I didnt mean Anne Protheroe said Miss Marple.",
    "I meant the\nwomen servants.",
    "They do so hate telling anything to the police.",
    "But a nicelooking young man \u2014 youll excuse me Mr. Redding\n\u2014 and one who has been unjustly suspected \u2014 oh Im sure\ntheyd tell him at once.",
    "Ill go and have a try this evening said Lawrence with vigour.",
    "Thanks for the hint Miss Marple.",
    "Ill go after \u2014 well after a little\njob the vicar and I are going to do.",
    "It occurred to me that we had better be getting on with it.",
    "I said goodbye to Miss Marple and we entered the woods once\nmore.",
    "First we went up the path till we came to a new spot where it\ncertainly looked as though someone had left the path on the\nrighthand side.",
    "Lawrence explained that he had already\nfollowed this particular trail and found it led nowhere but he\nadded that we might as well try again.",
    "He might have been\nwrong.",
    "It was however as he had said.",
    "After about ten or twelve yards\nany sign of broken and trampled leaves petered out.",
    "It was from\nthis spot that Lawrence had broken back towards the path to\nmeet me earlier in the afternoon.",
    "We emerged on the path again and walked a little farther along\nit.",
    "Again we came to a place where the bushes seemed\ndisturbed.",
    "The\n\nsigns\n\nwere\n\nvery\n\nslight\n\nbut\n\nI\n\nthought\n\n\funmistakable.",
    "This time the trail was more promising.",
    "By a\ndevious course it wound steadily nearer to the Vicarage.",
    "Presently we arrived at where the bushes grew thickly up to the\nwall.",
    "The wall is a high one and ornamented with fragments of\nbroken bottles on the top.",
    "If any one had placed a ladder against\nit we ought to find traces of their passage.",
    "We were working our way slowly along the wall when a sound\ncame to our ears of a breaking twig.",
    "I pressed forward forcing\nmy way through a thick tangle of shrubs \u2014 and came face to\nface with Inspector Slack.",
    "So its you he said.",
    "And Mr. Redding.",
    "Now what do you think\nyou two gentlemen are doing\n\nSlightly crestfallen we explained.",
    "Quite so said the inspector.",
    "Not being the fools were usually\nthought to be I had the same idea myself.",
    "Ive been here over an\nhour.",
    "Would you like to know something\n\n\fYes I said meekly.",
    "Whoever murdered Colonel Protheroe didnt come this way to\ndo it Theres not a sign either on this side of the wall nor the\nother.",
    "Whoever murdered Colonel Protheroe came through the\nfront door.",
    "Theres no other way he could have come.",
    "Impossible I cried.",
    "Why impossible Your door stands open.",
    "Any ones only got to\nwalk in.",
    "They cant be seen from the kitchen.",
    "They know youre\nsafely out of the way they know Mrs. Clement is in London they\nknow Mr. Dennis is at a tennis party.",
    "Simple as A B C. And they\ndont need to go or come through the village.",
    "Just opposite the\nVicarage gate is a public footpath and from it you can turn into\nthese same woods and come out whichever way you choose.",
    "Unless Mrs. Price Ridley were to come out of her front gate at\nthat particular minute its all clear sailing.",
    "A great deal more so\nthan climbing over walls.",
    "The side windows of the upper story of\nMrs. Price Ridleys house do overlook most of that wall.",
    "No\ndepend upon it thats the way he came.",
    "It really seemed as though he must be right.",
    "Chapter XVII\n\nInspector Slack came round to see me the following morning.",
    "He\nis I think thawing towards me.",
    "In time he may forget the\nincident of the clock.",
    "Well sir he greeted me.",
    "Ive traced that telephone call that\nyou received.",
    "Indeed I said eagerly.",
    "Its rather odd.",
    "It was put through from the North Lodge of Old\nHall.",
    "Now that lodge is empty the lodgekeepers have been\npensioned off and the new lodgekeepers arent in yet.",
    "The place\nwas empty and convenient \u2014 a window at the back was open.",
    "No fingerprints on the instrument itself \u2014 it had been wiped\nclear.",
    "Thats suggestive.",
    "How do you mean\n\nI mean that it shows that call was put through deliberately to\nget you out of the way.",
    "Therefore the murder was carefully\nplanned in advance.",
    "If it had been just a harmless practical joke\nthe fingerprints wouldnt have been wiped off so carefully.",
    "No.",
    "I see that.",
    "It also shows that the murderer was well acquainted with Old\nHall and its surroundings.",
    "It wasnt Mrs. Protheroe who put that\ncall through.",
    "Ive accounted for every moment of her time that\nafternoon.",
    "There are half a dozen servants who can swear that\nshe was at home up till fivethirty.",
    "Then the car came round and\n\n\fdrove Colonel Protheroe and her to the village.",
    "The colonel went\nto see Quinton the vet about one of the horses.",
    "Mrs. Protheroe\ndid some ordering at the grocers and at the fish shop and from\nthere came straight down the back lane where Miss Marple saw\nher.",
    "All the shops agree she carried no handbag with her.",
    "The\nold lady was right.",
    "She usually is I said mildly.",
    "And Miss Protheroe was over at Much Benham at 5.30.",
    "Quite so I said.",
    "My nephew was there too.",
    "That disposes of her.",
    "The maids seems all right \u2014 a bit\nhysterical and upset but what can you expect Of course Ive\ngot my eye on the butler \u2014 what with giving notice and all.",
    "But I\ncant think he knows anything about it.",
    "Your inquiries seem to have had rather a negative result\ninspector.",
    "They do and they do not sir.",
    "Theres one very queer thing has\nturned up \u2014 quite unexpectedly I may say.",
    "Yes\n\nYou remember the fuss that Mrs. Price Ridley who lives next\ndoor to you was kicking up yesterday morning About being\nrung up on the telephone\n\nYes I said.",
    "Well we traced the call just to calm her \u2014 and where on this\nearth do you think it was put through from\n\nA call office I hazarded.",
    "No Mr. Clement.",
    "That call was put through from Mr. Lawrence\nReddings cottage.",
    "What I exclaimed surprised.",
    "Yes.",
    "A bit odd isnt it Mr. Redding had nothing to do with it.",
    "At\nthat time 6.30 he was on his way to the Blue Boar with Dr. Stone\nin full view of the village.",
    "But there it is.",
    "Suggestive oh\nSomeone walked into that empty cottage and used the\ntelephone who was it Thats two queer telephone calls in one\nday.",
    "Makes you think theres some connection between them.",
    "Ill\neat my hat if they werent both put through by the same person.",
    "But with what object\n\nWell thats what weve got to find out.",
    "There seems no\nparticular point in the second one but there must be a point\nsomewhere.",
    "And you see the significance Mr. Reddings house\nused to telephone from.",
    "Mr. Reddings pistol.",
    "All throwing\nsuspicion on Mr. Redding.",
    "It would be more to the point to have put through the first call\nfrom his house I objected.",
    "Ah but Ive been thinking that out.",
    "What did Mr. Redding do\nmost afternoons He went up to Old Hall and painted Miss\n\n\fProtheroe.",
    "And from his cottage hed go on his motor bicycle\npassing through the North Gate.",
    "Now you see the point of the\ncall being put through from there.",
    "The murderer is someone who\ndidnt know about the quarrel and that Mr. Redding wasnt going\nup to Old Hall any more.",
    "I reflected a moment to let the inspectors points sink into my\nbrain.",
    "They seemed to me logical and unavoidable.",
    "Were there any fingerprints on the receiver in Mr. Reddings\ncottage I asked.",
    "There were not said the inspector bitterly.",
    "That drafted old\nwoman who goes and does for him had been and dusted them off\nyesterday morning.",
    "He reflected wrathfully for a few minutes.",
    "Shes a stupid old fool anyway.",
    "Cant remember when she saw\nthe pistol last.",
    "It might have been there on the morning of the\ncrime or it might not.",
    "She couldnt say shes sure.",
    "Theyre all\nalike\n\n\fJust as a matter of form I went round and saw Dr. Stone he\nwent on.",
    "I must say he was pleasant as could be about it.",
    "He\nand Miss Cram went up to that mound \u2014 or barrow \u2014 or\nwhatever you call it about halfpast two yesterday and stayed\nthere all the afternoon.",
    "Dr. Stone came back alone and she\ncame later.",
    "He says he didnt hear any shot but admits hes\nabsentminded.",
    "But it all bears out what we think.",
    "Only I said you havent caught the murderer.",
    "Hm said the inspector.",
    "It was a womans voice you heard\nthrough the telephone.",
    "It was in all probability a womans voice\nMrs. Price Ridley heard.",
    "If only that shot hadnt come hard on the\nclose of the telephone call \u2014 well Id know where to look.",
    "Where\n\nAh thats just what its best not to say sir.",
    "Unblushingly I suggested a glass of old port.",
    "I have some very\nfine old vintage port.",
    "Eleven oclock in the morning is not the\n\n\fusual time for drinking port but I did not think that mattered with\nInspector Slack.",
    "It was of course cruel abuse of the vintage\nport but one must not be squeamish about such things.",
    "When Inspector Slack had polished off the second glass he\nbegan to unbend and become genial.",
    "Such is the effect of that\nparticular port.",
    "I dont suppose it matters with you sir he said.",
    "Youll keep it\nto yourself No letting it get round the parish.",
    "I reassured him.",
    "Seeing as the whole thing happened in your house it almost\nseems as though you had a right to know.",
    "Just what I feel myself I said.",
    "Well then sir what about the lady who called on Colonel\nProtheroe the night before the murder\n\n\fMrs.\n\nLestrange\n\nI\n\ncried\n\nspeaking\n\nrather\n\nloud\n\nin\n\nmy\n\nastonishment.",
    "The inspector threw me a reproachful glance.",
    "Not so loud sir.",
    "Mrs. Lestrange is the lady Ive got my eye on.",
    "You remember what I told you \u2014 blackmail.",
    "Hardly a reason for murder.",
    "Wouldnt it be a case of killing the\ngoose that laid the golden eggs That is assuming that your\nhypothesis is true which I dont for a minute admit.",
    "The inspector winked at me in a common manner.",
    "Ah shes the kind the gentlemen will always stand up for.",
    "Now\nlook here sir.",
    "Suppose shes successfully blackmailed the old\ngentleman in the past.",
    "After a lapse of years she gets wind of\nhim comes down here and tries it on again.",
    "But in the\nmeantime things have changed.",
    "The law has taken up a very\ndifferent stand.",
    "Every facility is given nowadays to people\nprosecuting for blackmail \u2014 names are not allowed to be\n\n\freported in the press.",
    "Suppose Colonel Protheroe turns round\nand says hell have the law on her.",
    "Shes in a nasty position.",
    "They\ngive a very severe sentence for blackmail.",
    "The boots on the\nother leg.",
    "The only thing to do to save herself is to put him out\ngood and quick.",
    "I was silent.",
    "I had to admit that the case the inspector had built\nup was plausible.",
    "Only one thing to my mind made it inadmissible\n\u2014 the personality of Mrs. Lestrange.",
    "I dont agree with you inspector I said.",
    "Mrs. Lestrange\ndoesnt seem to me to be a potential blackmailer.",
    "Shes \u2014 well\nits an oldfashioned word but shes a \u2014 lady.",
    "He threw me a pitying glance.",
    "Ah well sir he said tolerantly youre a clergyman.",
    "You dont\nknow half of what goes on.",
    "Lady indeed Youd be surprised if\nyou knew some of the things I know.",
    "Im not referring to mere social position.",
    "Anyway I should\nimagine Mrs. Lestrange to be a declass\u00e9e.",
    "What I mean is a\nquestion of \u2014 personal refinement.",
    "You dont see her with the same eyes as I do sir.",
    "I may be a man\n\u2014 but Im a police officer too.",
    "They cant get over me with their\npersonal refinement.",
    "Why that woman is the kind who could\nstick a knife into you without turning a hair.",
    "Curiously enough I could believe Mrs. Lestrange guilty of\nmurder much more easily than I could believe her capable of\nblackmail.",
    "But of course she cant have been telephoning to the old lady\nnext door and shooting Colonel Protheroe at one and the same\ntime continued the inspector.",
    "The words were hardly out of his mouth when he slapped his leg\nferociously.",
    "Got it he exclaimed.",
    "Thats the point of the telephone call.",
    "Kind of alibi.",
    "Knew wed connect it with the first one.",
    "Im going to\nlook into this.",
    "She may have bribed some village lad to do the\nphoning for her.",
    "Hed never think of connecting it with the\nmurder.",
    "The inspector hurried off.",
    "Miss Marple wants to see you said Griselda putting her head\nin.",
    "She sent over a very incoherent note \u2014 all spidery and\nunderlined.",
    "I couldnt read most of it.",
    "Apparently she cant leave\nhome herself.",
    "Hurry up and go across and see her and find out\nwhat it is.",
    "Ive got my old women coming in two minutes or Id\ncome myself.",
    "I do hate old women \u2014 they tell you about their bad\nlegs and sometimes insist on showing them to you What luck\nthat the inquest is this afternoon You wont have to go and\nwatch the Boys Club Cricket Match.",
    "I hurried off considerably exercised in my mind as to the reason\nfor this summons.",
    "I found Miss Marple in what I believe is described as a fluster.",
    "She was very pink and slightly incoherent.",
    "My nephew she explained.",
    "My nephew Raymond West the\nauthor.",
    "He is coming down today.",
    "Such a todo.",
    "I have to see to\neverything myself.",
    "You cannot trust a maid to air a bed properly\nand we must of course have a meat meal tonight.",
    "Gentlemen\nrequire such a lot of meat do they not And drink.",
    "There\ncertainly should be some drink in the house \u2014 and a siphon.",
    "If I can do anything \u2014 I began.",
    "Oh how very kind.",
    "But I did not mean that.",
    "There is plenty of\ntime really.",
    "He brings his own pipe and tobacco I am glad to say.",
    "Glad because it saves me from knowing which kind of cigarettes\nare right to buy.",
    "But rather sorry too because it takes so long\nfor the smell to get out of the curtains.",
    "Of course I open the\nwindow and shake them well very early every morning.",
    "Raymond\ngets up very late \u2014 I think writers often do.",
    "He writes very clever\nbooks I believe though people are not really nearly so\n\n\funpleasant as he makes out.",
    "Clever young men know so little of\nlife dont you think\n\nWould you like to bring him to dinner at the Vicarage I asked\nstill unable to gather why I had been summoned.",
    "Oh no thank you said Miss Marple.",
    "Its very kind of you she\nadded.",
    "There was \u2014 er \u2014 something you wanted to see me about I\nthink I suggested desperately.",
    "Oh of course.",
    "In all the excitement it had gone right out of my\nhead.",
    "She broke off and called to her maid.",
    "Emily \u2014 Emily.",
    "Not\nthose sheets.",
    "The frilled ones with the monogram and dont put\nthem too near the fire.",
    "She closed the door and returned to me on tiptoe.",
    "Its just rather a curious thing that happened last night she\nexplained.",
    "I thought you would like to hear about it though at\n\n\fthe moment it doesnt seem to make sense.",
    "I felt very wakeful\nlast night \u2014 wondering about all this sad business.",
    "And I got up\nand looked out of my window.",
    "And what do you think I saw\n\nI looked inquiring.",
    "Gladys Cram said Miss Marple with great emphasis.",
    "As I live\ngoing into the wood with a suitcase.",
    "A suitcase\n\nIsnt it extraordinary What should she want with a suitcase in\nthe wood at twelve oclock at night\n\nYou see said Miss Marple.",
    "I daresay it has nothing to do with\nthe murder.",
    "But it is a Peculiar Thing.",
    "And just at present we all\nfeel we must take notice of Peculiar Things.",
    "Perfectly amazing I said.",
    "Was she going to \u2014 er \u2014 sleep in\nthe barrow by any chance\n\n\fShe didnt at any rate said Miss Marple.",
    "Because quite a\nshort time afterwards she came back and she hadnt got the\nsuitcase with her.",
    "Chapter XVIII\n\nThe inquest was held that afternoon Saturday at two oclock at\nthe Blue Boar.",
    "The local excitement was I need hardly say\ntremendous.",
    "There had been no murder in St. Mary Mead for at\nleast fifteen years.",
    "And to have someone like Colonel Protheroe\nmurdered actually in the Vicarage study is such a feast of\nsensation as rarely falls to the lot of a village population.",
    "Various comments floated to my ears which I was probably not\nmeant to hear.",
    "Theres vicar.",
    "Looks pale dont he I wonder if he had a hand in\nit.",
    "Twas done at Vicarage after all.",
    "How can you Mary\nAdams And him visiting Henry Abbott at the time.",
    "Oh but they\ndo say him and the colonel had words.",
    "Theres Mary Hill.",
    "Giving\nherself airs she is on account of being in service there.",
    "Hush\nheres coroner.",
    "The coroner was Dr. Roberts of our adjoining town of Much\nBenham.",
    "He cleared his throat adjusted his eyeglasses and\nlooked important.",
    "To recapitulate all the evidence would be merely tiresome.",
    "Lawrence Redding gave evidence of finding the body and\nidentified the pistol as belonging to him.",
    "To the best of his belief\nhe had seen it on the Tuesday two days previously.",
    "It was kept\non a shelf in his cottage and the door of the cottage was\nhabitually unlocked.",
    "Mrs. Protheroe gave evidence that she had last seen her\nhusband at about a quarter to six when they separated in the\n\n\fvillage street.",
    "She agreed to call for him at the Vicarage later.",
    "She had gone to the Vicarage about a quarter past six by way of\nthe back lane and the garden gate.",
    "She had heard no voices in\nthe study and had imagined that the room was empty but her\nhusband might have been sitting at the writingtable in which\ncase she would not have seen him.",
    "As far as she knew he had\nbeen in his usual health and spirits.",
    "She knew of no enemy who\nmight have had a grudge against him.",
    "I gave evidence next told of my appointment with Protheroe and\nmy summons to the Abbotts.",
    "I described how I had found the\nbody and my summoning of Dr. Haydock.",
    "How many people Mr. Clement were aware that Colonel\nProtheroe was coming to see you that evening\n\nA good many I should imagine.",
    "My wife knew and my nephew\nand Colonel Protheroe himself alluded to the fact that morning\nwhen I met him in the village.",
    "I should think several people might\nhave overheard him as being slightly deaf he spoke in a loud\nvoice.",
    "It was then a matter of common knowledge Any one might\nknow\n\nI agreed.",
    "Haydock followed.",
    "He was an important witness.",
    "He described\ncarefully and technically the appearance of the body and the\nexact injuries.",
    "It was his opinion that deceased had been shot\nwhilst actually in the act of writing.",
    "He placed the time of death\nat approximately 6.20 to 6.30 \u2014 certainly not later than 6.35.",
    "That was the outside limit.",
    "He was positive and emphatic on that\npoint.",
    "There was no question of suicide the wound could not\nhave been selfinflicted.",
    "Inspector Slacks evidence was discreet and abridged.",
    "He\ndescribed his summons and the circumstances under which he\nhad found the body.",
    "The unfinished letter was produced and the\ntime on it \u2014 6.20 \u2014 noted.",
    "Also the clock.",
    "It was tacitly assumed\nthat the time of death was 6.22.",
    "The police were giving nothing\n\n\faway.",
    "Anne Protheroe told me afterwards that she had been told\nto suggest a slightly earlier period of time than 6.20 for her visit.",
    "Our maid Mary was the next witness and proved a somewhat\ntruculent one.",
    "She hadnt heard anything and didnt want to hear\nanything.",
    "It wasnt as though gentlemen who came to see the\nvicar usually got shot.",
    "They didnt.",
    "Shed got her own jobs to look\nafter.",
    "Colonel Protheroe had arrived at a quarter past six\nexactly.",
    "No she didnt look at the clock.",
    "She heard the church\nchime after she had shown him into the study.",
    "She didnt hear\nany shot.",
    "If there had been a shot shed have heard it.",
    "Well of\ncourse she knew there must have been a shot since the\ngentleman was found shot \u2014 but there it was.",
    "She hadnt heard\nit.",
    "The coroner did not press the point.",
    "I realised that he and\nColonel Melchett were working in agreement.",
    "Mrs. Lestrange had been subp\u0153naed to give evidence but a\nmedical certificate signed by Dr. Haydock was produced\nsaying she was too ill to attend.",
    "There was only one other witness a somewhat doddering old\nwoman.",
    "The one who in Slacks phrase did for Lawrence\nRedding.",
    "Mrs. Archer was shown the pistol and recognized it as the one\nshe had seen in Mr. Reddings sittingroom over against the\nbookcase he kept it lying about.",
    "She had last seen it on the\nday of the murder.",
    "Yes \u2014 in answer to a further question \u2014 she\nwas quite sure it was there at lunch time on Thursday \u2014 quarter\nto one when she left.",
    "I remembered what the inspector had told me and I was mildly\nsurprised.",
    "However vague she might have been when he\nquestioned her she was quite positive about it now.",
    "The coroner summed up in a negative manner but with a good\ndeal of firmness.",
    "The verdict was given almost immediately\n\nMurder by Person or Persons unknown.",
    "As I left the room I was aware of a small army of young men with\nbright alert faces and a kind of superficial resemblance to each\nother.",
    "Several of them were already known to me by sight as\nhaving haunted the Vicarage the last few days.",
    "Seeking to\nescape I plunged back into the Blue Boar and was lucky enough\nto run straight into the arch\u00e6ologist Dr. Stone.",
    "I clutched at him\nwithout ceremony.",
    "Journalists I said briefly and expressively.",
    "If you could\ndeliver me from their clutches\n\nWhy certainly Mr. Clement.",
    "Come upstairs with me.",
    "He led the way up the narrow staircase and into his sittingroom\nwhere Miss Cram was sitting rattling the keys of a typewriter\nwith a practiced touch.",
    "She greeted me with a broad smile of\nwelcome and seized the opportunity to stop work.",
    "Awful isnt it she said.",
    "Not knowing who did it I mean.",
    "Not\nbut that Im disappointed in an inquest.",
    "Tame thats what I call it.",
    "Nothing what you might call spicy from beginning to end.",
    "You were there then Miss Cram\n\nI was there all right.",
    "Fancy your not seeing me.",
    "Didnt you see\nme I feel a bit hurt about that.",
    "Yes I do.",
    "A gentleman even if he\nis a clergyman ought to have eyes in his head.",
    "Were you present also I asked Dr. Stone in an effort to\nescape from this playful badinage.",
    "Young women like Miss Cram\nalways make me feel awkward.",
    "No Im afraid I feel very little interest in such things.",
    "I am a man\nvery wrapped up in his own hobby.",
    "It must be a very interesting hobby I said.",
    "You know something of it perhaps\n\nI was obliged to confess that I knew next to nothing.",
    "Dr. Stone was not the kind of man whom a confession of\nignorance daunts.",
    "The result was exactly the same as though I\nhad said that the excavation of barrows was my only relaxation.",
    "He surged and eddied into speech.",
    "Long barrows round\nbarrows stone age bronze age paleolithic neolithic kistv\u00e6ns\nand cromlechs it burst forth in a torrent.",
    "I had little to do save\nnod my head and look intelligent \u2014 and that last is perhaps over\noptimistic.",
    "Dr. Stone boomed on.",
    "He was a little man.",
    "His head\nwas round and bald his face was round and rosy and he\nbeamed at you through very strong glasses.",
    "I have never known\na man so enthusiastic on so little encouragement.",
    "He went into\nevery argument for and against his own pet theory \u2014 which by\nthe way I quite failed to grasp\n\nHe detailed at great length his difference of opinion with Colonel\nProtheroe.",
    "An opinionated boor he said with heat.",
    "Yes yes I know he is\ndead and one should speak no ill of the dead.",
    "But death does\nnot alter facts.",
    "An opinionated boor describes him exactly.",
    "Because he had read a few books he set himself up as an\n\n\fauthority \u2014 against a man who has made a lifelong study of the\nsubject.",
    "My whole life Mr. Clement has been given up to this\nwork.",
    "My whole life \u2014\n\nHe was spluttering with excitement.",
    "Gladys Cram brought him\nback to earth with a terse sentence.",
    "Youll miss your train if you dont look out she observed.",
    "Oh The little man stopped in mid speech and dragged a watch\nfrom his pocket.",
    "Bless my soul.",
    "Quarter to Impossible.",
    "Once you start talking you never remember the time.",
    "What\nyoud do without me to look after you I reely dont know.",
    "Quite right my dear quite right.",
    "He patted her affectionately\non the shoulder.",
    "This is a wonderful girl Mr. Clement.",
    "Never\nforgets anything.",
    "I consider myself extremely lucky to have\nfound her.",
    "Oh go on Dr. Stone said the lady.",
    "You spoil me you do.",
    "I could not help feeling that I should be in a material position to\nadd my support to the second school of thought \u2014 that which\nforesees lawful matrimony as the future of Dr. Stone and Miss\nCram.",
    "I imagined that in her own way Miss Cram was rather a\nclever young woman.",
    "Youd better be getting along said Miss Cram.",
    "Yes yes so I must.",
    "He vanished into the room next door and returned carrying a\nsuitcase.",
    "You are leaving I asked in some surprise.",
    "Just running up to town for a couple of days he explained.",
    "My\nold mother to see tomorrow some business with my lawyers on\nMonday.",
    "On Tuesday I shall return.",
    "By the way I suppose that\nColonel Protheroes death will make no difference to our\n\n\farrangements.",
    "As regards the barrow I mean.",
    "Mrs. Protheroe\nwill have no objection to our continuing the work\n\nI should not think so.",
    "As he spoke I wondered who actually would be in authority at\nOld Hall.",
    "It was just possible that Protheroe might have left it to\nLettice.",
    "I felt that it would be interesting to know the contents of\nProtheroes will.",
    "Causes a lot of trouble in a family a death does remarked\nMiss Cram with a kind of gloomy relish.",
    "You wouldnt believe\nwhat a nasty spirit there sometimes is.",
    "Well I must really be going.",
    "Dr. Stone made ineffectual\nattempts to control the suitcase a large rug and an unwieldy\numbrella.",
    "I came to his rescue.",
    "He protested.",
    "Dont trouble \u2014 dont trouble.",
    "I can manage perfectly.",
    "Doubtless there will be somebody downstairs.",
    "But down below there was no trace of a boots or any one else.",
    "I\nsuspect that they were being regaled at the expense of the\nPress.",
    "Time was getting on so we set out together to the station\nDr. Stone carrying the suitcase and I holding the rug and\numbrella.",
    "Dr. Stone ejaculated remarks in between panting breaths as we\nhurried along.",
    "Really too good of you \u2014 didnt mean \u2014 to trouble you. . . . Hope\nwe shant miss \u2014 the train \u2014 Gladys is a good girl \u2014 really a\nwonderful girl \u2014 a very sweet nature \u2014 not too happy at home\nIm afraid \u2014 absolutely \u2014 the heart of a child \u2014 heart of a child I\ndo assure you in spite of \u2014 difference in our ages \u2014 find a lot in\ncommon. . . .\n\nWe saw Lawrence Reddings cottage just as we turned off to the\nstation.",
    "It stands in an isolated position with no other house near\nit.",
    "I observed two young men of smart appearance standing on\nthe doorstep and a couple more peering in at the windows.",
    "It\nwas a busy day for the Press.",
    "Nice fellow young Redding I remarked to see what my\ncompanion would say.",
    "He was so out of breath by this time that he found it difficult to\nsay anything but he puffed out a word which I did not at first\nquite catch.",
    "Dangerous he gasped when I asked him to repeat his remark.",
    "Dangerous\n\nMost dangerous.",
    "Innocent girls \u2014 know no better \u2014 taken in by\na fellow like that \u2014 always hanging round women. . . . No good.",
    "From which I deduced that the only young man in the village had\nnot passed unnoticed by the fair Gladys.",
    "Goodness ejaculated Dr. Stone.",
    "The train\n\n\fWe were close to the station by this time and we broke into a fast\nsprint.",
    "A down train was standing in the station and the up\nLondon train was just coming in.",
    "At the door of the booking office we collided with a rather\nexquisite young man and I recognised Miss Marples nephew\njust arriving.",
    "He is I think a young man who does not like to be\ncollided with.",
    "He prides himself on his poise and general air of\ndetachment and there is no doubt that vulgar contact is\ndetrimental to poise of any kind.",
    "He staggered back.",
    "I\napologised hastily and we passed in.",
    "Dr. Stone climbed on the\ntrain and I handed up his baggage just as the train gave an\nunwilling jerk and started.",
    "I waved to him and then turned away.",
    "Raymond West had\ndeparted but our local chemist who rejoices in the name of\nCherubim was just setting out for the village.",
    "I walked beside\nhim.",
    "Close shave that he observed.",
    "Well how did the inquest go\nMr. Clement\n\n\fI gave him the verdict.",
    "Oh so thats what happened.",
    "I rather thought that would be the\nverdict.",
    "Wheres Dr. Stone off to\n\nI repeated what he had told me.",
    "Lucky not to miss the train.",
    "Not that you ever know on this line.",
    "I\ntell you Mr. Clement its a crying shame.",
    "Disgraceful thats\nwhat I call it.",
    "Train I came down by was ten minutes late.",
    "And\nthat on a Saturday with no traffic to speak of.",
    "And on Wednesday\n\u2014 no Thursday \u2014 yes Thursday it was \u2014 I remember it was the\nday of the murder because I meant to write a stronglyworded\ncomplaint to the company \u2014 and the murder put it out of my\nhead \u2014 yes last Thursday.",
    "I had been to a meeting of the\nPharmaceutical Society.",
    "How late do you think the 6.50 was\nHalf an hour.",
    "Half an hour exactly What do you think of that Ten\nminutes I dont mind.",
    "But if the train doesnt get in till twenty past\nseven well you cant get home before halfpast.",
    "What I say is\nwhy call it the 6.50\n\n\fQuite so I said and wishing to escape from the monologue I\nbroke away with the excuse that I had something to say to\nLawrence Redding whom I saw approaching us on the other side\nof the road.",
    "Chapter XIX\n\nVery glad to have met you said Lawrence.",
    "Come to my\nplace.",
    "We turned in at the little rustic gate went up the path and he\ndrew a key from his pocket and inserted it in the lock.",
    "You keep the door locked now I observed.",
    "Yes.",
    "He laughed rather bitterly.",
    "Case of stable door when the\nsteed is gone eh It is rather like that.",
    "You know padre he\nheld the door open and I passed inside theres something\nabout all this business that I dont like.",
    "Its too much of \u2014 how\nshall I put it \u2014 an inside job.",
    "Someone knew about that pistol of\nmine.",
    "That means that the murderer whoever he was must have\nactually been in this house \u2014 perhaps even had a drink with\nme.",
    "Not necessarily I objected.",
    "The whole village of St. Mary\nMead probably knows exactly where you keep your toothbrush\nand what kind of tooth powder you use.",
    "But why should it interest them\n\nI dont know I said but it does.",
    "If you change your shaving\ncream it will be a topic of conversation.",
    "They must be very hard up for news.",
    "They are.",
    "Nothing exciting ever happens here.",
    "Well it has now \u2014 with a vengeance.",
    "I agreed.",
    "And who tells them all these things anyway Shaving cream and\nthings like that\n\nProbably old Mrs. Archer.",
    "That old crone Shes practically a halfwit as far as I can make\nout.",
    "Thats merely the camouflage of the poor I explained.",
    "They\ntake refuge behind a mask of stupidity.",
    "Youll probably find that\nthe old lady has all her wits about her.",
    "By the way she seems\nvery certain now that the pistol was in its proper place midday\nThursday.",
    "Whats made her so positive all of a sudden\n\nI havent the least idea.",
    "Do you think shes right\n\nThere again I havent the least idea.",
    "I dont go round taking an\ninventory of my possessions every day.",
    "I looked round the small livingroom.",
    "Every shelf and table was\nlittered with miscellaneous articles.",
    "Lawrence lived in the midst\nof an artistic disarray that would have driven me quite mad.",
    "Its a bit of a job finding things sometimes he said observing\nmy glance.",
    "On the other hand everything is handy \u2014 not\ntucked away.",
    "Nothing is tucked away certainly I agreed.",
    "It might perhaps\nhave been better if the pistol had been.",
    "Do you know I rather expected the coroner to say something of\nthe sort.",
    "Coroners are such asses.",
    "I expected to be censured or\nwhatever they call it.",
    "By the way I asked was it loaded\n\nLawrence shook his head.",
    "Im not quite so careless as that.",
    "It was unloaded but there was\na box of cartridges beside it.",
    "It was apparently loaded in all six chambers and one shot bad\nbeen fired.",
    "Lawrence nodded.",
    "And whose hand fired it Its all very well sir but unless the\nreal murderer is discovered I shall be suspected of the crime to\nthe day of my death.",
    "Dont say that my boy.",
    "But I do say it.",
    "He became silent frowning to himself.",
    "He roused himself at last\nand said\n\nBut let me tell you how I got on last night.",
    "You know old Miss\nMarple knows a thing or two.",
    "She is I believe rather unpopular on that account.",
    "Lawrence proceeded to recount his story.",
    "He had following Miss Marples advice gone up to old Hall.",
    "There with Annes assistance he had had an interview with the\nparlourmaid.",
    "Anne had said simply\n\nMr. Redding wants to ask you a few questions Rose.",
    "Then she had left the room.",
    "Lawrence had felt somewhat nervous.",
    "Rose a pretty girl of\ntwentyfive gazed at him with a limpid gaze which he found\nrather disconcerting.",
    "Its \u2014 its about Colonel Protheroes death.",
    "Yes sir.",
    "Im very anxious you see to get at the truth.",
    "Yes sir.",
    "I feel that there may be \u2014 that someone might \u2014 that \u2014 that\nthere might be some incident \u2014\n\nAt this point Lawrence felt that he was not covering himself with\nglory and heartily cursed Miss Marple and her suggestions.",
    "I wondered if you could help me\n\nYes sir\n\nRoses demeanour was still that of the perfect servant polite\nanxious to assist and completely uninterested.",
    "Dash it all said Lawrence havent you talked the thing over in\nthe servants hall\n\nThis method of attack flustered Rose slightly.",
    "Her perfect poise\nwas shaken.",
    "In the servants hall sir\n\nOr the housekeepers room or the bootboys dugout or\nwherever you do talk There must be some place.",
    "Rose displayed a very faint disposition to giggle and Lawrence\nfelt encouraged.",
    "Look here Rose youre an awfully nice girl.",
    "Im sure you must\nunderstand what Im feeling like.",
    "I dont want to be hanged.",
    "I\ndidnt murder your master but a lot of people think I did.",
    "Cant\nyou help me in any way\n\n\fI can imagine at this point that Lawrence must have looked\nextremely appealing.",
    "His handsome head thrown back his Irish\nblue eyes appealing.",
    "Rose softened and capitulated.",
    "Oh sir Im sure \u2014 if any of us could help in any way.",
    "None of us\nthink you did it sir.",
    "Indeed we dont.",
    "I know my dear girl but thats not going to help me with the\npolice.",
    "The police Rose tossed her head.",
    "I can tell you sir we dont\nthink much of that inspector.",
    "Slack he calls himself.",
    "The police\nindeed.",
    "All the same the police are very powerful.",
    "Now Rose you say\nyoull do your best to help me.",
    "I cant help feeling that theres a\nlot we havent got at yet.",
    "The lady for instance who called to\nsee Colonel Protheroe the night before he died.",
    "Mrs. Lestrange\n\n\fYes Mrs. Lestrange.",
    "I cant help feeling theres something\nrather odd about that visit of hers.",
    "Yes indeed sir thats what we all said.",
    "You did\n\nComing the way she did.",
    "And asking for the colonel.",
    "And of\ncourse theres been a lot of talk \u2014 nobody knowing anything\nabout\n\nher\n\ndown\n\nhere.",
    "And\n\nMrs.\n\nSimmons\n\nshes\n\nthe\n\nhousekeeper sir she gave it as her opinion that she was a\nregular bad lot.",
    "But after hearing what Gladdie said well I didnt\nknow what to think.",
    "What did Gladdie say\n\nOh nothing sir.",
    "It was just \u2014 we were talking you know.",
    "Lawrence looked at her.",
    "He had the feeling of something kept\nback.",
    "I wonder very much what her interview with Colonel Protheroe\nwas about.",
    "Yes sir.",
    "I believe you know Rose\n\nMe Oh I no sir.",
    "Indeed I dont.",
    "How could I\n\nLook here Rose.",
    "You said youd help me.",
    "If you overheard\nanything anything at all \u2014 it mightnt seem important but\nanything .",
    ". . Id be so awfully grateful to you.",
    "After all any one\nmight \u2014 might chance \u2014 just chance to overhear something.",
    "But I didnt sir really I didnt.",
    "Then somebody else did said Lawrence acutely\n\nWell sir \u2014\n\nDo tell me Rose.",
    "I dont know what Gladdie would say Im sure.",
    "Shed want you to tell me.",
    "Who is Gladdie by the way\n\nShes the kitchenmaid sir.",
    "And you see shed just stepped out\nto speak to a friend and she was passing the window \u2014 the\nstudy window \u2014 and the master was there with the lady.",
    "And of\ncourse he did speak very loud the master did always.",
    "And\nnaturally feeling a little curious \u2014 I mean \u2014\n\nAwfully natural said Lawrence I mean one would simply have\nto listen.",
    "But of course she didnt tell any one \u2014 except me.",
    "And we both\nthought it very odd.",
    "But Gladdie couldnt say anything you see\nbecause if it was known shed gone out to meet a \u2014 a friend \u2014\nwell it would have meant a lot of unpleasantness with Mrs. Pratt\nthats the cook sir.",
    "But Im sure shed tell you anything sir\nwilling.",
    "Well can I go to the kitchen and speak to her\n\nRose was horrified by the suggestion.",
    "Oh no sir that would never do.",
    "And Gladdies a very nervous\ngirl anyway.",
    "At last the matter was settled after a lot of discussion over\ndifficult points.",
    "A clandestine meeting was arranged in the\nshrubbery.",
    "Here in due course Lawrence was confronted by the nervous\nGladdie whom he described as more like a shivering rabbit than\nanything human.",
    "Ten minutes were spent in trying to put the girl\nat her ease the shivering Gladys explaining that she couldnt\never \u2014 that she didnt ought that she didnt think Rose would\nhave given her away that anyway she hadnt meant no harm\nindeed she hadnt and that shed catch it badly if Mrs. Pratt ever\ncame to hear of it.",
    "Lawrence reassured cajoled persuaded \u2014 at last Gladys\nconsented to speak.",
    "If youll be sure itll go no further sir.",
    "Of course it wont.",
    "And it wont be brought up against me in a court of law\n\nNever.",
    "And you wont tell the mistress\n\nNot on any account.",
    "If it were to get to Mrs. Pratts ears \u2014\n\nIt wont.",
    "Now tell me Gladys.",
    "If youre sure its all right\n\nOf course it is.",
    "Youll be glad some day youve saved me from\nbeing hanged.",
    "Gladys gave a little shriek.",
    "Oh indeed I wouldnt like that sir.",
    "Well its very little I heard \u2014\nand that entirely by accident as you might say \u2014\n\nI quite understand.",
    "But the master he was evidently very angry.",
    "After all these\nyears \u2014 thats what he was saying \u2014 you dare to come here \u2014\nIts an outrage \u2014 I couldnt hear what the lady said \u2014 but after a\nbit he said I utterly refuse \u2014 utterly \u2014 I cant remember\neverything \u2014 seemed as though they were at it hammer and\ntongs she wanting him to do something and he refusing.",
    "Its a\ndisgrace that you should have come down here thats one thing\nhe said.",
    "And You shall not see her \u2014 I forbid it \u2014 and that made\nme prick up my ears.",
    "Looked as though the lady wanted to tell\nMrs. Protheroe a thing or two and he was afraid about it.",
    "And I\nthought to myself Well now fancy the master Him so\nparticular.",
    "And maybe no beauty himself when alls said and\ndone.",
    "Fancy I said.",
    "And Men are all alike I said to my friend\n\n\flater.",
    "Not that hed agree.",
    "Argued he did.",
    "But he did admit he\nwas\n\nsurprised\n\nat\n\nColonel\n\nProtheroe\n\n\u2014\n\nhim\n\nbeing\n\na\n\nchurchwarden and handing round the plate and reading the\nlessons on Sundays.",
    "But there I said thats very often the\nworst.",
    "For thats what Ive heard my mother say many a time.",
    "Gladdie paused out of breath and Lawrence tried tactfully to get\nback to where the conversation had started.",
    "Did you hear anything else\n\nWell its difficult to remember exactly sir.",
    "It was all much the\nsame.",
    "He said once or twice I dont believe it.",
    "Just like that.",
    "Whatever Haydock says I dont believe it.",
    "He said that did he Whatever Haydock says\n\nYes.",
    "And he said it was all a plot.",
    "You didnt hear the lady speak at all\n\n\fOnly just at the end.",
    "She must have got up to go and come\nnearer the window.",
    "And I heard what she said.",
    "Made my blood\nrun cold it did.",
    "Ill never forget it.",
    "By this time tomorrow night\nyou may be dead she said.",
    "Wicked the way she said it.",
    "As soon\nas I heard the news There I said to Rose.",
    "There\n\nLawrence wondered.",
    "Principally he wondered how much of\nGladyss story was to be depended upon.",
    "True in the main he\nsuspected that it had been embellished and polished since the\nmurder.",
    "In especial he doubted the accuracy of the last remark.",
    "He thought it highly possible that it owed its being to the fact of\nthe murder.",
    "He thanked Gladys rewarded her suitably reassured her as to\nher misdoings being made known to Mrs. Pratt and left Old Hall\nwith a good deal to think over.",
    "One thing was clear Mrs. Lestranges interview with Colonel\nProtheroe had certainly not been a peaceful one and it was one\nwhich he was anxious to keep from the knowledge of his wife.",
    "I thought of Miss Marples churchwarden with his separate\nestablishment.",
    "Was this a case resembling that\n\nI wondered more than ever where Haydock came in He had\nsaved Mrs. Lestrange from having to give evidence at the\ninquest.",
    "He had done his best to protect her from the police.",
    "How far would he carry that protection\n\nSupposing he suspected her of crime \u2014 would he still try and\nshield her\n\nShe was a curious woman \u2014 a woman of very strong magnetic\ncharm.",
    "I myself hated the thought of connecting her with the\ncrime in any way.",
    "Something in me said It cant be her Why\n\n\fAnd an imp in my brain replied Because shes a very beautiful\nand attractive woman.",
    "Thats why\n\nThere is as Miss Marple would say a lot of human nature in all of\nus.",
    "Chapter XX\n\nWhen I got back to the Vicarage I found that we were in the\nmiddle of a domestic crisis.",
    "Griselda met me in the hall and with tears in her eyes dragged\nme into the drawingroom.",
    "Shes going.",
    "Whos going\n\n\fMary.",
    "Shes given notice.",
    "I really could not take the announcement in a tragic spirit.",
    "Well I said well have to get another servant.",
    "It seemed to me a perfectly reasonable thing to say.",
    "When one\nservant goes you get another.",
    "I was at a loss to understand\nGriseldas look of reproach.",
    "Len \u2014 you are absolutely heartless.",
    "You dont care.",
    "I didnt.",
    "In fact I felt almost lighthearted at the prospect of no\nmore burnt puddings and undercooked vegetables.",
    "Ill have to look for a girl and find one and train her continued\nGriselda in a voice of acute selfpity.",
    "Is Mary trained I said.",
    "Of course she is.",
    "I suppose I said that somebody has heard her address us as\nsir or mam and has immediately wrested her from us as a\nparagon.",
    "All I can say is theyll be disappointed.",
    "It isnt that said Griselda.",
    "Nobody else wants her.",
    "I dont see\nhow they could.",
    "Its her feelings.",
    "Theyre upset because Lettice\nProtheroe said she didnt dust properly.",
    "Griselda often comes out with surprising statements but this\nseemed to me so surprising that I questioned it.",
    "It seemed to me\nthe most unlikely thing in the world that Lettice Protheroe should\ngo out of her way to interfere in our domestic affairs and reprove\nour\n\nmaid\n\nfor\n\nslovenly\n\nhousework.",
    "It\n\nwas\n\ncompletely\n\nunLetticelike and I said so.",
    "I dont see I said what our dust has to do with Lettice\nProtheroe.",
    "Nothing at all said my wife.",
    "Thats why its so unreasonable.",
    "I\nwish youd go and talk to Mary yourself.",
    "Shes in the kitchen.",
    "I had no wish to talk to Mary on the subject but Griselda who is\nvery energetic and quick fairly pushed me through the baize\ndoor into the kitchen before I had time to rebel.",
    "Mary was peeling potatoes at the sink.",
    "Er \u2014 goodafternoon I said nervously.",
    "Mary looked up and snorted but made no other response.",
    "Mrs. Clement tells me that you wish to leave us I said.",
    "Mary condescended to reply to this.",
    "Theres some things she said darkly as no girl can be asked\nto put up with.",
    "Will you tell me exactly what it is that has upset you\n\n\fTell you that in two words I can.",
    "Here I may say she vastly\nunderestimated.",
    "People coming snooping round here when my\nbacks turned.",
    "Poking round.",
    "And what business of hers is it\nhow often the study is dusted or turned out If you and the\nmissus dont complain its nobody elses business.",
    "If I give\nsatisfaction to you thats all that matters I say.",
    "Mary has never given satisfaction to me.",
    "I confess that I have a\nhankering after a room thoroughly dusted and tidied every\nmorning.",
    "Marys practice of flicking off the more obvious deposit\non the surface of low tables is to my thinking grossly inadequate.",
    "However I realised that at the moment it was no good to go into\nside issues.",
    "Had to go to that inquest didnt I Standing up before twelve\nmen a respectable girl like me And who knows what questions\nyou may be asked.",
    "Ill tell you this.",
    "Ive never before been in a\nplace where they had a murder in the house and I never want to\nbe again.",
    "I hope you wont I said.",
    "On the law of averages I should say it\nwas very unlikely.",
    "I dont hold with the law.",
    "He was a magistrate.",
    "Many a poor\nfellow sent to jail for potting at a rabbit \u2014 and him with his\npheasants and what not.",
    "And then before hes so much as\ndecently buried that daughter of his comes round and says I\ndont do my work properly.",
    "Do you mean that Miss Protheroe has been here\n\nFound her here when I come back from the Blue Boar.",
    "In the\nstudy she was.",
    "And Oh she says.",
    "Im looking for my little yellow\nberry \u2014 a little yellow hat.",
    "I left it here the other day.",
    "Well I\nsays I havent seen no hat.",
    "It wasnt here when I done the room\non Thursday morning I says.",
    "And Oh she says but I dare say\nyou wouldnt see it.",
    "You dont spend much time doing a room do\nyou And with that she draws her finger along the mantelshelf\nand looks at it.",
    "As though I had time on a morning like this to take\noff all them ornaments and put them back with the police only\nunlocking the room the night before.",
    "If the vicar and his lady are\n\n\fsatisfied thats all that matters I think miss I said.",
    "And she\nlaughs and goes out of the window and says Oh but are you\nsure they are\n\nAnd there it is A girl has her feelings Im sure Id work my\nfingers to the bone for you and the missus.",
    "And if she wants a\nnewfangled dish tried Im always ready to try it.",
    "Im sure you are I said soothingly.",
    "But she must have heard something or she wouldnt have said\nwhat she did.",
    "And if I dont give satisfaction Id rather go.",
    "Not\nthat I take any notice of what Miss Protheroe says.",
    "Shes not\nloved up at the Hall I can tell you.",
    "Never a please or a thank you\nand everything scattered right and left.",
    "I wouldnt set any store\nby Miss Lettice Protheroe myself for all that Mr. Dennis is so set\nupon her.",
    "But shes the kind that can always twist a young\ngentleman round her little finger.",
    "During all this Mary had been extracting eyes from potatoes\nwith such energy that they had been flying round the kitchen like\n\n\fhailstones.",
    "At this moment one hit me in the eye and caused a\nmomentary pause in the conversation.",
    "Dont you think I said as I dabbed my eye with my\nhandkerchief that you have been rather too inclined to take\noffense where none is meant You know Mary your mistress\nwill be very sorry to lose you.",
    "Ive nothing against the mistress \u2014 or against you sir for that\nmatter.",
    "Well then dont you think youre being rather silly\n\nMary sniffed.",
    "I was a bit upset like after the inquest and all.",
    "And a girl has her\nfeelings.",
    "But\n\nI\n\nwouldnt\n\ninconvenience.",
    "Then thats all right I said.",
    "like\n\nto\n\ncause\n\nthe\n\nmistress\n\n\fI left the kitchen to find Griselda and Dennis waiting for me in the\nhall.",
    "Well exclaimed Griselda.",
    "Shes staying I said and sighed.",
    "Len said my wife you have been clever.",
    "I felt rather inclined to disagree with her.",
    "I did not think I had\nbeen clever.",
    "It is my firm opinion that no servant could be a\nworse one than Mary.",
    "Any change I consider would have been a\nchange for the better.",
    "But I like to please Griselda.",
    "I detailed the heads of Marys\ngrievance.",
    "How like Lettice said Dennis.",
    "She couldnt have left that\nyellow beret of hers here on Wednesday.",
    "She was wearing it for\ntennis on Thursday.",
    "That seems to me highly probable I said.",
    "She never knows where shes left anything said Dennis with a\nkind of affectionate pride and admiration that I felt was entirely\nuncalled for.",
    "She loses about a dozen things every day.",
    "A remarkably attractive trait I observed.",
    "Any sarcasm missed Dennis.",
    "She is attractive he said with a deep sigh.",
    "People are always\nproposing to her \u2014 she told me so.",
    "They must be illicit proposals if theyre made to her down here\nI remarked.",
    "We havent got a bachelor in the place.",
    "Theres Dr. Stone said Griselda her eyes dancing.",
    "He asked her to come and see the barrow the other day I\nadmitted.",
    "Of course he did said Griselda.",
    "She is attractive Len.",
    "Even\nbaldheaded arch\u00e6ologists feel it.",
    "Lots of S.A. said Dennis sapiently.",
    "And yet Lawrence Redding is completely untouched by Lettices\ncharm.",
    "Griselda however explained that with the air of one who\nknew she was right.",
    "Lawrence has got lots of S.A. himself.",
    "That kind always likes the\n\u2014 how shall I put it \u2014 the Quaker type.",
    "Very unrestrained and\ndiffident.",
    "The kind of women whom everybody calls cold.",
    "I think\nAnne is the only woman who could ever hold Lawrence.",
    "I dont\nthink theyll ever tire of each other.",
    "All the same I think hes\nbeen rather stupid in one way.",
    "Hes rather made use of Lettice\nyou know.",
    "I dont think he ever dreamed she cared \u2014 hes\nawfully modest in some ways \u2014 but I have a feeling she does.",
    "She cant bear him said Dennis positively.",
    "She told me so.",
    "I have never seen anything like the pitying silence with which\nGriselda received this remark.",
    "I went into my study.",
    "There was to my fancy still a rather eerie\nfeeling in the room.",
    "I knew that I must get over this.",
    "Once give in\nto that feeling and I should probably never use the study again.",
    "I\nwalked thoughtfully over to the writing table.",
    "Here Protheroe\nhad sat red faced hearty selfrighteous and here in a moment\nof time he had been struck down.",
    "Here where I was standing\nan enemy had stood .",
    ". .\n\nAnd so \u2014 no more Protheroe .",
    ". .",
    "Here was the pen his fingers had held.",
    "On the floor was a faint dark stain \u2014 the rug had been sent to the\ncleaners but the blood had soaked through.",
    "I shivered.",
    "I cant use this room I said aloud.",
    "I cant use it.",
    "Then my eye was caught by something \u2014 a mere speck of bright\nblue.",
    "I bent down.",
    "Between the floor and the desk I saw a small\nobject.",
    "I picked it up.",
    "I was standing staring at it in the palm of my hand when Griselda\ncame in.",
    "I forgot to tell you Len.",
    "Miss Marple wants us to go over tonight\nafter dinner.",
    "To amuse the nephew.",
    "Shes afraid of his being dull.",
    "I said wed go.",
    "Very well my dear.",
    "What are you looking at\n\nNoting.",
    "I closed my hand and looking at my wife observed\n\nIf you dont amuse Master Raymond West my dear he must be\nvery hard to please.",
    "My wife said Dont be ridiculous Len and turned pink.",
    "She went out again and I unclosed my hand.",
    "In the palm of my hand was a blue lapis lazuli earring set in seed\npearls.",
    "It was rather an unusual jewel and I knew very well where I had\nseen it last.",
    "Chapter XXI\n\nI cannot say that I have at any time a great admiration for Mr.\nRaymond West.",
    "He is I know supposed to be a brilliant novelist\n\n\fand has made quite a flame as a poet.",
    "His poems have no capital\nletters in them which is I believe the essence of modernity.",
    "His\nbooks are about unpleasant people leading lives of surpassing\ndullness.",
    "He has a tolerant affection for Aunt Jane whom he alludes to\nin her presence as a survival.",
    "She listens to his talk with a flattering interest and if there is\nsometimes an amused twinkle in her eye I am sure he never\nnotices it.",
    "He fastened on Griselda at once with flattering abruptness.",
    "They\ndiscussed modern plays and from there went on to modern\nschemes of decoration.",
    "Griselda affects to laugh at Raymond\nWest but she is I think susceptible to his conversation.",
    "During my dull conversation with Miss Marple I heard at\nintervals the reiteration buried as you are down here.",
    "It began at last to irritate me.",
    "I said suddenly\n\n\fI suppose you consider us very much out of things down here\n\nRaymond West waved his cigarette.",
    "I regard St. Mary Mead he said authoritatively as a stagnant\npool.",
    "He looked at us prepared for resentment at his statement but\nsomewhat I think to his chagrin no one displayed annoyance.",
    "That is really not a very good simile dear Raymond said Miss\nMarple briskly.",
    "Nothing I believe is so full of life under the\nmicroscope as a drop of water from a stagnant pool.",
    "Life \u2014 of a kind admitted the novelist.",
    "Its all much the same kind really isnt it said Miss Marple.",
    "You compare yourself to a denizen of a stagnant pond Aunt\nJane\n\n\fMy dear you said something of the sort in your last book I\nremember.",
    "No clever young man likes having his works quoted against\nhimself.",
    "Raymond West was no exception.",
    "That was entirely different he snapped.",
    "Life is after all very much the same everywhere said Miss\nMarple in her placid voice.",
    "Getting born you know and growing\nup \u2014 and coming into contact with other people \u2014 getting\njostled \u2014 and then marriage and more babies \u2014\n\nAnd finally death said Raymond West.",
    "And not death with a\ndeath certificate always.",
    "Death in life.",
    "Talking of death said Griselda.",
    "You know weve had a murder\nhere\n\nRaymond West waved murder away with his cigarette.",
    "Murder is so crude he said.",
    "I take no interest in it.",
    "That statement did not take me in for a moment.",
    "They say all the\nworld loves a lover \u2014 apply that saying to murder and you have\nan even more infallible truth.",
    "No one can fail to be interested in a\nmurder.",
    "Simple people like Griselda and myself can admit the\nfact but any one like Raymond West has to pretend to be bored\n\u2014 at anyrate for the first five minutes.",
    "Miss Marple however gave her nephew away by remarking\n\nRaymond and I have been discussing nothing else all through\ndinner.",
    "I take a great interest in all the local news said Raymond\nhastily.",
    "He smiled benignly and tolerantly at Miss Marple.",
    "Have you a theory Mr. West asked Griselda.",
    "Logically said Raymond West again flourishing his cigarette\nonly one person could have killed Protheroe.",
    "Yes said Griselda.",
    "We hung upon his words with flattering attention.",
    "The vicar said Raymond and pointed an accusing finger at\nme.",
    "I gasped.",
    "Of course he reassured me I know you didnt do it.",
    "Life is\nnever what it should be.",
    "But think of the drama \u2014 the fitness \u2014\nchurchwarden murdered in the vicars study by the vicar.",
    "Delicious\n\nAnd the motive I inquired.",
    "Oh thats interesting.",
    "He sat up \u2014 allowed his cigarette to go\nout.",
    "Inferiority complex I think.",
    "Possibly too many inhibitions.",
    "I\n\n\fshould like to write the story of the affair.",
    "Amazingly complex.",
    "Week after week year after year hes seen the man \u2014 at vestry\nmeetings \u2014 at choirboys outings \u2014 handing round the bag in\nchurch \u2014 bringing it to the altar.",
    "Always he dislikes the man \u2014\nalways he chokes down his dislike.",
    "Its unChristian he wont\nencourage it.",
    "And so it festers underneath and one day \u2014\n\nHe made a graphic gesture.",
    "Griselda turned to me.",
    "Have you ever felt like that Len\n\nNever I said truthfully.",
    "Yet I hear you were wishing him out of the world not so long\nago remarked Miss Marple.",
    "That miserable Dennis But my fault of course for ever making\nthe remark.",
    "Im afraid I was I said.",
    "It was a stupid remark to make but\nreally Id had a very trying morning with him.",
    "Thats disappointing said Raymond West.",
    "Because of\ncourse if your subconscious were really planning to do him in it\nwould never have allowed you to make that remark.",
    "He sighed.",
    "My theory falls to the ground.",
    "This is probably a very ordinary\nmurder \u2014 a revengeful poacher or something of that sort.",
    "Miss Cram came to see me this afternoon said Miss Marple.",
    "I\nmet her in the village and I asked her if she would like to see my\ngarden.",
    "Is she fond of gardens asked Griselda.",
    "I dont think so said Miss Marple with a faint twinkle.",
    "But it\nmakes a very useful excuse for talk dont you think\n\n\fWhat did you make of her asked Griselda.",
    "I dont believe\nshes really so bad.",
    "She volunteered a lot of information \u2014 really a lot of\ninformation said Miss Marple.",
    "About herself you know and\nher people.",
    "They all seem to be dead or in India.",
    "Very sad.",
    "By the\nway she has gone to Old Hall for the weekend.",
    "What\n\nYes it seems Mrs. Protheroe asked her \u2014 or she suggested it\nto Mrs. Protheroe \u2014 I dont quite know which way about it was.",
    "To do some secretarial work for her \u2014 there are so many letters\nto cope with.",
    "It turned out rather fortunately.",
    "Dr. Stone being\naway she has nothing to do.",
    "What an excitement this barrow has\nbeen.",
    "Stone said Raymond.",
    "Is that the arch\u00e6ologist fellow\n\nYes he is excavating a barrow.",
    "On the Protheroe property.",
    "Hes a good man said Raymond.",
    "Wonderfully keen on his job.",
    "I met him at a dinner not long ago and we had a most interesting\ntalk.",
    "I must look him up.",
    "Unfortunately I said hes just gone to London for the\nweekend.",
    "Why you actually ran into him at the station this\nafternoon.",
    "I ran into you.",
    "You had a little fat man with you \u2014 with glasses\non.",
    "Yes \u2014 Dr. stone.",
    "But my dear fellow \u2014 that wasnt Stone.",
    "Not Stone\n\nNot the arch\u00e6ologist.",
    "I know him quite well.",
    "The man wasnt\nStone \u2014 not the faintest resemblance.",
    "We stared at each other.",
    "In particular I stared at Miss Marple.",
    "Extraordinary I said.",
    "The suitcase said Miss Marple.",
    "But why said Griselda.",
    "It reminds me of the time the man went round pretending to be\nthe gas inspector murmured Miss Marple.",
    "Quite a little haul\nhe got.",
    "An impostor said Raymond West.",
    "Now this is really\ninteresting.",
    "The question is has it anything to do with the murder said\nGriselda.",
    "Not necessarily I said.",
    "But \u2014 I looked at Miss Marple.",
    "It is she said a Peculiar Thing.",
    "Another Peculiar Thing.",
    "Yes I said rising.",
    "I rather feel the inspector ought to be told\nabout this at once.",
    "Chapter XXII\n\nInspector Slacks orders once I had got him on the telephone\nwere brief and emphatic.",
    "Nothing was to get about.",
    "In\nparticular Miss Cram was not to be alarmed.",
    "In the meantime a\nsearch\n\nwas\n\nto\n\nbe\n\ninstituted\n\nfor\n\nthe\n\nsuitcase\n\nin\n\nthe\n\nneighbourhood of the barrow.",
    "Griselda and I returned home very excited over this new\ndevelopment.",
    "We could not say much with Dennis present as we\nhad faithfully promised Inspector Slack to breathe no word to\nanybody.",
    "In any case Dennis was full of his own troubles.",
    "He came into my\nstudy and began fingering things and shuffling his feet and\nlooking thoroughly embarrassed.",
    "What is it Dennis I said at last.",
    "Uncle Len I dont want to go to sea.",
    "I was astonished.",
    "The boy had been so very decided about his\ncareer up to now.",
    "But you were so keen on it.",
    "Yes but Ive changed my mind.",
    "What do you want to do\n\nI want to go into finance.",
    "I was even more surprised.",
    "What do you mean \u2014 finance\n\nJust that.",
    "I want to go into the city.",
    "But my dear boy I am sure you would not like the life.",
    "Even if I\nobtained a post for you in a bank.",
    "Dennis said that wasnt what he meant.",
    "He didnt want to go into\na bank.",
    "I asked him what exactly he did mean and of course as I\nsuspected the boy didnt really know.",
    "By going into finance he simply meant getting rich quickly\nwhich with the optimism of youth he imagined was a certainty if\none went into the city.",
    "I disabused him of this notion as gently\nas I could.",
    "Whats put it into your head I asked.",
    "You were so satisfied\nwith the idea of going to sea.",
    "I know Uncle Len but Ive been thinking.",
    "I shall want to marry\nsome day \u2014 and I mean youve got to be rich to marry a girl.",
    "Facts disprove your theory I said.",
    "I know \u2014 but a real girl.",
    "I mean a girl whos used to things.",
    "It was very vague but I thought I knew what he meant.",
    "You know I said gently all girls arent like Lettice Protheroe.",
    "He fired up at once.",
    "Youre awfully unfair to her.",
    "You dont like her.",
    "Griselda doesnt\neither.",
    "She says shes tiresome.",
    "From the feminine point of view Griselda is quite right.",
    "Lettice is\ntiresome.",
    "I could quite realise however that a boy would resent\nthe adjective.",
    "If only people made a few allowances.",
    "Why even the Hartley\nNapiers are going about grousing about her at a time like this\nJust because she left their old tennis party a bit early.",
    "Why\nshould she stay if she was bored Jolly decent of her to go at all\nI think.",
    "Quite a favour I said but Dennis suspected no malice.",
    "He was\nfull of his own grievance on Lettices behalf.",
    "Shes awfully unselfish really.",
    "Just to show you she made me\nstay.",
    "Naturally I wanted to go too.",
    "But she wouldnt hear of it.",
    "Said it was too bad on the Napiers.",
    "So just to please her I\nstopped on a quarter of an hour.",
    "The young have very curious views on unselfishness.",
    "And now I hear Susan Hartley Napier is going about\neverywhere saying Lettice has rotten manners.",
    "If I were you I said I shouldnt worry.",
    "Its all very well but \u2014\n\nHe broke off.",
    "Id \u2014 Id do anything for Lettice.",
    "Very few of us can do anything for any one else I said.",
    "However much we wish it we are powerless.",
    "I wish I were dead said Dennis.",
    "Poor lad.",
    "Calf love is a virulent disease.",
    "I forebore to say any of\nthe obvious and probably irritating things which come so easily\nto ones lips.",
    "Instead I said goodnight and went up to bed.",
    "I took the eight oclock service the following morning and when I\nreturned found Griselda sitting at the breakfast table with an\nopen note in her hand.",
    "It was from Anne Protheroe.",
    "DEAR GRISELDA \u2014 If you and the vicar could come up and\nlunch here quietly today I should be so very grateful.",
    "Something very strange has occurred and I should like Mr.\nClements advice.",
    "Please dont mention this when you come as I have said nothing\nto any one.",
    "With love Yours affectionately\n\nANNE PROTHEROE.",
    "We must go of course said Griselda.",
    "I agreed.",
    "I wonder what can have happened\n\nI wondered too.",
    "You know I said to Griselda I dont feel we are really at the\nend of this case yet.",
    "You mean not till someone has really been arrested\n\nNo I said I didnt mean that.",
    "I mean that there are\nramifications undercurrents that we know nothing about.",
    "There are a whole lot of things to clear up before we get at the\ntruth.",
    "You mean things that dont really matter but that get in the\nway\n\nYes I think that expresses my meaning very well.",
    "I think were all making a great fuss said Dennis helping\nhimself to marmalade.",
    "Its a jolly good thing old Protheroe is\ndead.",
    "Nobody liked him.",
    "Oh I know the police have got to worry\n\u2014 its their job.",
    "But I rather hope myself theyll never find out.",
    "I\n\n\fshould hate to see Slack promoted going about swelling with\nimportance over his cleverness.",
    "I am human enough to feel that I agree over the matter of Slacks\npromotion.",
    "A man who goes about systematically rubbing people\nup the wrong way cannot hope to be popular.",
    "Dr. Haydock thinks rather like I do went on Dennis.",
    "Hed\nnever give a murderer up to justice.",
    "He said so.",
    "I think that that is the danger of Haydocks views.",
    "They may be\nsound in themselves \u2014 it is not for me to say \u2014 but they produce\nan impression on the young careless mind which I am sure\nHaydock himself never meant to convey.",
    "Griselda looked out of the window and remarked that there were\nreporters in the garden.",
    "I suppose theyre photographing the study windows again she\nsaid with a sigh.",
    "We had suffered a good deal in this way.",
    "There was first the idle\ncuriosity of the village \u2014 every one had come to gape and stare.",
    "There were next the reporters armed with cameras and the\nvillage again to watch the reporters.",
    "In the end we had to have a\nconstable from Much Benham on duty outside the window.",
    "Well I said the funeral is tomorrow morning.",
    "After that\nsurely the excitement will die down.",
    "I noticed a few reporters hanging about Old Hall when we\narrived there.",
    "They accosted me with various queries to which I\ngave the invariable answer we had found it the best that I\nhad nothing to say.",
    "We were shown by the butler into the drawingroom the sole\noccupant of which turned out to be Miss Cram \u2014 apparently in a\nstate of high enjoyment.",
    "This is a surprise isnt it she said as she shook hands.",
    "I\nnever should have thought of such a thing but Mrs. Protheroe is\nkind isnt she And of course it isnt what you might call nice\n\n\ffor a young girl to be staying alone at a place like the Blue Boar\nreporters about and all.",
    "And of course its not as though I\nhavent been able to make myself useful \u2014 you really need a\nsecretary at a time like this and Miss Protheroe doesnt do\nanything to help does she\n\nI was amused to notice that the old animosity against Lettice\npersisted but that the girl had apparently become a warm\npartisan of Annes.",
    "At the same time I wondered if the story of\nher coming here was strictly accurate.",
    "In her account the\ninitiative had come from Anne but I wondered if that were really\nso.",
    "The first mention of disliking to be at the Blue Boar alone\nmight have easily come from the girl herself.",
    "Whilst keeping an\nopen mind on the subject I did not fancy that Miss Cram was\nstrictly truthful.",
    "At that moment Anne Protheroe entered the room.",
    "She was dressed very quietly in black.",
    "She carried in her hand a\nSunday paper which she held out to me with a rueful glance.",
    "Ive never had any experience of this sort of thing.",
    "Its pretty\nghastly isnt it I saw a reporter at the inquest.",
    "I just said that I\nwas terribly upset and had nothing to say and then he asked me\nif I wasnt very anxious to find my husbands murderer and I said\nYes.",
    "And then whether I had any suspicions and I said No.",
    "And\nwhether I didnt think the crime showed local knowledge and I\nsaid it seemed to certainly.",
    "And that was all.",
    "And now look at\nthis\n\nIn the middle of the page was a photograph evidently taken at\nleast ten years ago \u2014 Heaven knows where they had dug it out.",
    "There were large headlines\n\nWIDOW DECLARES SHE WILL NEVER REST TILL SHE HAS\nHUNTED DOWN HUSBANDS MURDERER.",
    "Mrs. Protheroe the widow of the murdered man is certain that\nthe murderer must be looked for locally.",
    "She has suspicions but\nno certainty.",
    "She declared herself prostrated with grief but\nreiterated her determination to hunt down the murderer.",
    "It doesnt sound like me does it said Anne.",
    "I dare say it might have been worse I said handing back the\npaper.",
    "Impudent arent they said Miss Cram.",
    "Id like to see one of\nthose fellows trying to get something out of me.",
    "By the twinkle in Griseldas eye I was convinced that she\nregarded this statement as being more literally true than Miss\nCram intended it to appear.",
    "Luncheon was announced and we went in.",
    "Lettice did not come\nin till halfway through the meal when she drifted into the empty\n\n\fplace with a smile for Griselda and a nod for me.",
    "I watched her\nwith some attention for reasons of my own but she seemed\nmuch the same vague creature as usual.",
    "Extremely pretty \u2014 that\nin fairness I had to admit.",
    "She was still not wearing mourning\nbut was dressed in a shade of pale green that brought out all the\ndelicacy of her fair colouring.",
    "After we had had coffee Anne said quietly\n\nI want to have a little talk with the vicar.",
    "I will take him up to my\nsittingroom.",
    "At last I was to learn the reason of our summons.",
    "I rose and\nfollowed her up the stairs.",
    "She paused at the door of the room.",
    "As I was about to speak she stretched out a hand to stop me.",
    "She remained listening looking down towards the hall.",
    "Good.",
    "They are going out into the garden.",
    "No \u2014 dont go in\nthere.",
    "We can go straight up.",
    "Much to my surprise she led the way along the corridor to the\nextremity of the wing.",
    "Here a narrow ladderlike staircase rose\nto the floor above and she mounted it I following.",
    "We found\nourselves in a dusty boarded passage.",
    "Anne opened a door and\nled one into a large dim attic which was evidently used as a\nlumber room.",
    "There were trunks there old broken furniture a\nfew stacked pictures and the many countless odds and ends\nwhich a lumber room collects.",
    "My surprise was so evident that she smiled faintly.",
    "First of all I must explain.",
    "I am sleeping very lightly just now.",
    "Last night \u2014 or rather this morning about three oclock I was\nconvinced that I heard someone moving about the house.",
    "I\nlistened for some time and at last got up and came out to see.",
    "Out on the landing I realised that the sounds came not from\ndown below but from up above.",
    "I came along to the foot of these\nstairs.",
    "Again I thought I heard a sound.",
    "I called up Is anybody\nthere But there was no answer and I heard nothing more so I\nassumed that my nerves had been playing tricks on me and\nwent back to bed.",
    "However early this morning I came up here \u2014 simply out of\ncuriosity.",
    "And I found this\n\nShe stooped down and turned round a picture that was leaning\nagainst the wall with the back of the canvas towards us.",
    "I gave a gasp of surprise.",
    "The picture was evidently a portrait in\noils but the face had been hacked and cut in such a savage way\nas to render it unrecognizable.",
    "Moreover the cuts were clearly\nquite fresh.",
    "What an extraordinary thing I said.",
    "Isnt it Tell me can you think of any explanation\n\nI shook my head.",
    "Theres a kind of savagery about it I said that I dont like.",
    "It\nlooks as though it had been done in a fit of maniacal rage.",
    "Yes thats what I thought.",
    "What is the portrait\n\nI havent the least idea.",
    "I have never seen it before.",
    "All these\nthings were in the attic when I married Lucius and came here to\nlive.",
    "I have never been through them or bothered about them.",
    "Extraordinary I commented.",
    "I stooped down and examined the other pictures.",
    "They were very\nmuch what you would expect to find \u2014 some very mediocre\nlandscapes some oleographs and a few cheaplyframed\nreproductions.",
    "There was nothing else helpful.",
    "A large oldfashioned trunk of\nthe kind that used to be called an ark had the initials E.P.",
    "upon\nit.",
    "I raised the lid.",
    "It was empty.",
    "Nothing else in the attic was the\nleast suggestive.",
    "It really is a most amazing occurrence I said.",
    "Its so \u2014\nsenseless.",
    "Yes said Anne.",
    "That frightens me a little.",
    "There was nothing more to see.",
    "I accompanied her down to her\nsittingroom where she closed the door.",
    "Do you think I ought to do anything about it Tell the police\n\nI hesitated.",
    "Its hard to say on the face of it whether \u2014\n\nIt has anything to do with the murder or not finished Anne.",
    "I\nknow.",
    "Thats what is so difficult.",
    "On the face of it there seems no\nconnection whatever.",
    "No I said but it is another Peculiar Thing.",
    "We both sat silent with puzzled brows.",
    "What are your plans if I may ask I said presently.",
    "She lifted her head.",
    "Im going to live here for at least another six months She said\nit defiantly.",
    "I dont want to.",
    "I hate the idea of living here.",
    "But I\nthink its the only thing to be done.",
    "Otherwise people will say that\nI ran away \u2014 that I had a guilty conscience.",
    "Surely not.",
    "Oh yes they will.",
    "Especially when \u2014 She paused and then\nsaid When the six months are up \u2014 I am going marry\nLawrence.",
    "Her eyes met mine.",
    "Were neither of us going to\nwait any longer.",
    "I supposed I said that that would happen.",
    "Suddenly she broke down burying her head in her hands.",
    "You dont know how grateful I am to you \u2014 you dont know.",
    "Wed said goodbye to each other \u2014 he was going away.",
    "I feel \u2014\nI feel not so awful about Luciuss death.",
    "If wed been planning to\ngo away together and hed died then \u2014 it would be so awful\nnow.",
    "But you made us both see how wrong it would be.",
    "Thats\nwhy Im grateful.",
    "I too am thankful I said gravely.",
    "All the same you know she sat up.",
    "Unless the real murderer\nis found theyll always think it was Lawrence \u2014 oh yes they will.",
    "And especially when he marries me.",
    "My dear Dr. Haydocks evidence made it perfectly clear \u2014\n\nWhat do people care about evidence They dont even know\nabout it.",
    "And medical evidence never means anything to\noutsiders anyway.",
    "Thats another reason why Im staying on\nhere.",
    "Mr. Clement Im going to find out the truth.",
    "Her eyes flashed as she spoke.",
    "She added\n\n\fThats why I asked that girl here.",
    "Miss Cram\n\nYes.",
    "You did ask her then.",
    "I mean it was your idea\n\nEntirely.",
    "Oh as a matter of fact she whined a bit.",
    "At the inquest\n\u2014 she was there when I arrived.",
    "No I asked her here\ndeliberately.",
    "But surely I cried you dont think that that silly young woman\ncould have anything to do with the crime\n\nIts awfully easy to appear silly Mr. Clement.",
    "Its one of the\neasiest things in the world.",
    "Then you really think\n\n\fNo I dont.",
    "Honestly I dont.",
    "What I do think is that that girl\nknows something \u2014 or might know something.",
    "I wanted to study\nher at close quarters.",
    "And the very night she arrives that picture is slashed I said\nthoughtfully.",
    "You think she did it But why It seems so utterly absurd and\nimpossible.",
    "It seems to me utterly impossible and absurd that your husband\nshould have been murdered in my study I said bitterly.",
    "But he\nwas.",
    "I know.",
    "She laid her hand on my arm.",
    "Its dreadful for you.",
    "I do\nrealise that though I havent said very much about it.",
    "I took the blue lapis lazuli earring from my pocket and held it out\nto her.",
    "This is yours I think\n\n\fOh yes.",
    "She held out her hand for it with a pleased smile.",
    "Where did you find it\n\nBut I did not put the jewel into her outstretched hand.",
    "Would you mind I said if I kept it a little longer\n\nWhy certainly.",
    "She looked puzzled and a little inquiring.",
    "I did\nnot satisfy her curiosity.",
    "Instead I asked her how she was situated financially.",
    "It is an impertinent question I said but I really do not mean it\nas such.",
    "I dont think its impertinent at all.",
    "You and Griselda are the best\nfriends I have here.",
    "And I like that funny old Miss Marple.",
    "Lucius\nwas very well off you know.",
    "He left things pretty equally divided\nbetween me and Lettice.",
    "Old Hall goes to me but Lettice is to be\nallowed to choose enough furniture to furnish a small house and\n\n\fshe is left a separate sum for the purpose of buying one so as to\neven things up.",
    "What are her plans do you know\n\nAnne made a comical grimace.",
    "She doesnt tell them to me.",
    "I imagine she will leave here as\nsoon as possible.",
    "She doesnt like me \u2014 she never has.",
    "I dare\nsay its my fault though Ive really always tried to be decent.",
    "But\nI suppose any girl resents a young stepmother.",
    "Are you fond of her I asked bluntly.",
    "She did not reply at once which convinced me that Anne\nProtheroe is a very honest woman.",
    "I was at first she said.",
    "She was such a pretty little girl.",
    "I dont\nthink I am now.",
    "I dont know why.",
    "Perhaps its because she\ndoesnt like me.",
    "I like being liked you know.",
    "We all do I said and Anne Protheroe smiled.",
    "I had one more task to perform.",
    "That was to get a word alone\nwith Lettice Protheroe.",
    "I managed that easily enough catching\nsight of her in the deserted drawingroom.",
    "Griselda and Gladys\nCram were out in the garden.",
    "I went in and shut the door.",
    "Lettice I said I want to speak to you about something.",
    "She looked up indifferently.",
    "Yes\n\nI had thought beforehand what to say.",
    "I held out the lapis\nearring and said quietly\n\nWhy did you drop that in my study\n\n\fI saw her stiffen for a moment \u2014 it was almost instantaneous.",
    "Her recovery was so quick that I myself could hardly have sworn\nto the movement.",
    "Then she said carelessly\n\nI never dropped anything in your study.",
    "Thats not mine.",
    "Thats\nAnnes.",
    "I know that I said.",
    "Well why ask me then Anne must have dropped it.",
    "Mrs. Protheroe has only been in my study once since the\nmurder and then she was wearing black and so would not have\nbeen likely to have had on a blue earring.",
    "In that case said Lettice I suppose she must have dropped it\nbefore.",
    "She added Thats only logical.",
    "Its very logical I said.",
    "I suppose you dont happen to\nremember when your stepmother was wearing these earrings\nlast\n\n\fOh She looked at me with a puzzled trustful gaze.",
    "Is it very\nimportant\n\nIt might be I said.",
    "Ill try and think.",
    "She sat there knitting her brows.",
    "I have never\nseen Lettice Protheroe look more charming than she did at that\nmoment.",
    "Oh yes she said suddenly.",
    "She had them on \u2014 on\nThursday.",
    "I remember now.",
    "Thursday I said slowly was the day of the murder.",
    "Mrs.\nProtheroe came to the study in the garden that day but if you\nremember in her evidence she only came as far as the study\nwindow not inside the room.",
    "Where did you find this\n\nRolled underneath the desk.",
    "Then it looks doesnt it said Lettice coolly as though she\nhadnt spoken the truth\n\nYou mean that she came right in and stood by the desk\n\nWell it looks like it doesnt it\n\nHer eyes met mine serenely.",
    "If you want to know she said calmly I never have thought she\nwas speaking the truth.",
    "And I know you are not Lettice.",
    "What do you mean\n\nShe was startled.",
    "I mean I said that the last time I saw this earring was on\nFriday morning when I came up here with Colonel Melchett.",
    "It\n\n\fwas lying with its fellow on your stepmothers dressingtable.",
    "I\nactually handled them both.",
    "Oh \u2014  She wavered then suddenly flung herself sideways\nover the arm of her chair and burst into tears.",
    "Her short fair hair\nhung down almost touching the floor.",
    "It was a strange attitude \u2014\nbeautiful and unrestrained.",
    "I let her sob for some moments in silence and then I said very\ngently\n\nLettice why did you do it\n\nWhat\n\nShe sprang up flinging her hair wildly back.",
    "She looked wild \u2014\nalmost terrified.",
    "What do you mean\n\nWhat made you do it Was it jealousy Dislike of Anne\n\n\fOh \u2014 oh yes.",
    "She pushed the hair back from her face and\nseemed suddenly to regain complete selfpossession.",
    "Yes you\ncan call it jealousy.",
    "Ive always disliked Anne \u2014 ever since she\ncame queening it here.",
    "I put the damned thing under the desk.",
    "I\nhoped it would get her into trouble.",
    "It would have done if you\nhadnt been such\n\na Nosey Parker fingering things on\n\ndressingtables.",
    "Anyway it isnt a clergymans business to go\nabout helping the police.",
    "It was a spiteful childish outburst.",
    "I took no notice of it.",
    "Indeed\nat that moment she seemed a very pathetic child indeed.",
    "Her childish attempt at vengeance against Anne seemed hardly\nto be taken seriously.",
    "I told her so and added that I should\nreturn the earring to her and say nothing of the circumstances\nin which I had found it.",
    "She seemed rather touched by that.",
    "Thats nice of you she said.",
    "She paused a minute and then said keeping her face averted\nand evidently choosing her words with care.",
    "You know Mr. Clement I should \u2014 I should get Dennis away\nfrom here soon if I were you.",
    "I \u2014 I think it would be better.",
    "Dennis I raised my eyebrows in slight surprise but with a\ntrace of amusement too.",
    "I think it would be better.",
    "She added still in the same awkward\nmanner Im sorry about Dennis.",
    "I didnt think he \u2014 anyway Im\nsorry.",
    "We left it at that.",
    "Chapter XXIII\n\nOn the way back I proposed to Griselda that we should make a\ndetour and go round by the barrow.",
    "I was anxious to see if the\npolice were at work and if so what they had found.",
    "Griselda\nhowever had things to do at home so I was left to make the\nexpedition on my own.",
    "I found Constable Hurst in charge of operations.",
    "No sign so far sir he reported.",
    "And yet it stands to reason\nthat this is the only place for a cache.",
    "His use of the word cache puzzled me for a moment as he\npronounced it catch but his real meaning occurred to me almost\nat once.",
    "Whatimeantersay is sir where else could the young woman be\ngoing starting into the wood by that path It leads to Old Hall\nand it leads here and thats about all.",
    "I suppose I said that Inspector Slack would disdain such a\nsimple course as asking the young lady straight out.",
    "Anxious not to put the wind up her said Hurst.",
    "Anything she\nwrites to Stone or he writes to her may throw light on things \u2014\nonce she knows were on to her shed shut up like that.",
    "Like what exactly was left in doubt but I personally doubted Miss\nGladys Cram ever being shut up in the way described.",
    "It was\nimpossible to imagine her as other than overflowing with\nconversation.",
    "When a mans an himpostor you want to know why hes an\nhimpostor said Constable Hurst didactically.",
    "Naturally I said.",
    "And the answer is to be found in this here barrow \u2014 or else why\nwas he for ever messing about with it\n\n\fA raison d\u00eatre for prowling about I suggested but this bit of\nFrench was too much for the constable.",
    "He revenged himself for\nnot understanding it by saying coldly\n\nThats the hamateurs point of view.",
    "Anyway you havent found the suitcase I said.",
    "We shall do sir.",
    "Not a doubt of it.",
    "Im not so sure I said.",
    "Ive been thinking.",
    "Miss Marple said it\nwas quite a short time before the girl reappeared emptyhanded.",
    "In that case she wouldnt have had time to get up here and\nback.",
    "You cant take any notice of what old ladies say.",
    "When theyve\nseen something curious and are waiting all eager like why time\nsimply flies for them.",
    "And anyway no lady knows anything about\ntime.",
    "I often wonder why the whole world is so prone to generalise.",
    "Generalisations are seldom or ever true and are usually utterly\ninaccurate.",
    "I have a poor sense of time myself hence the\nkeeping of my clock fast and Miss Marple I should say has a\nvery acute one.",
    "Her clocks keep time to the minute and she\nherself is rigidly punctual on every occasion.",
    "However I had no intention of arguing with Constable Hurst on\nthe point.",
    "I wished him goodafternoon and good luck and went\non my way.",
    "It was just as I was nearing home that the idea came to me.",
    "There was nothing to lead up to it.",
    "It just flashed into my brain as\na possible solution.",
    "You will remember that on my first search of the path the day\nafter the murder I had found the bushes disturbed in a certain\nplace.",
    "They proved or so I thought at the time to have been\ndisturbed by Lawrence bent on the same errand as myself.",
    "But I remembered that afterwards he and I together had come\nupon another faintly marked trail which proved to be that of the\ninspector.",
    "On thinking it over I distinctly remembered that the\nfirst trail Lawrences had been much more noticeable than the\nsecond as though more than one person had been passing that\nway.",
    "And I reflected that that was probably what had drawn\nLawrences attention to it in the first instance.",
    "Supposing that it\nhad originally been made by either Dr. Stone or else Miss Cram\n\nI remembered or else I imagined remembering that there had\nbeen several withered leaves on broken twigs.",
    "If so the trail\ncould not have been made the afternoon of our search.",
    "I was just approaching the spot in question.",
    "I recognised it easily\nenough and once more forced my way through the bushes.",
    "This\ntime I noticed fresh twigs broken.",
    "Someone had passed this way\nsince Lawrence and myself.",
    "I soon came to the place where I had encountered Lawrence.",
    "The faint trail however persisted farther and I continued to\nfollow it.",
    "Suddenly it widened out into a little clearing which\n\n\fshowed signs of recent upheaval.",
    "I say a clearing because the\ndenseness of the undergrowth was thinned out there but the\nbranches of the trees met overhead and the whole place was not\nmore than a few feet across.",
    "On the other side the undergrowth grew densely again and it\nseemed quite clear that no one had forced a way through it\nrecently.",
    "Nevertheless it seemed to have been disturbed in one\nplace.",
    "I went across and kneeled down thrusting the bushes aside with\nboth hands.",
    "A glint of a shiny brown surface rewarded me.",
    "Full\nof excitement I thrust my arm in and with a good deal of\ndifficulty I extracted a small brown suitcase.",
    "I uttered an ejaculation of triumph.",
    "I had been successful.",
    "Coldly\nsnubbed by Constable Hurst I had yet proved right in my\nreasoning.",
    "Here without doubt was the suitcase carried by Miss\nCram.",
    "I tried the hasp but it was locked.",
    "As I rose to my feet I noticed a small brownish crystal lying on\nthe ground.",
    "Almost automatically I picked it up and slipped it\ninto my pocket.",
    "Then grasping my find by the handle I retraced my steps to the\npath.",
    "As I climbed over the stile into the lane an agitated voice near at\nhand called out\n\nOh Mr. Clement.",
    "Youve found it How clever of you\n\nMentally registering the fact that in the art of seeing without\nbeing seen Miss Marple had no rival I balanced my find on the\npalings between us.",
    "Thats the one said Miss Marple.",
    "Id know it anywhere.",
    "This I thought was a slight exaggeration.",
    "There are thousands\nof cheap shiny suitcases all exactly alike.",
    "No one could\nrecognise one particular one seen from such a distance away by\n\n\fmoonlight but I realised that the whole business of the suitcase\nwas Miss Marples particular triumph and as such she was\nentitled to a little pardonable exaggeration.",
    "Its locked I suppose Mr. Clement\n\nYes.",
    "Im just going to take it down to the police station.",
    "You dont think it would be better to telephone\n\nOf course unquestionably it would be better to telephone.",
    "To\nstride through the village suitcase in hand would be to court a\nprobably undesirable publicity.",
    "So I unlatched Miss Marples garden gate and entered the house\nby\n\nthe\n\nFrench\n\nwindow\n\nand\n\nfrom\n\nthe\n\nsanctity\n\nof\n\nthe\n\ndrawingroom with the door shut I telephoned my news.",
    "The result was that Inspector Slack announced he would be up\nhimself in a couple of jiffies.",
    "When he arrived it was in his most cantankerous mood.",
    "So weve got it have we he said.",
    "You know sir you shouldnt\nkeep things to yourself.",
    "If youve any reason to believe you know\nwhere the article in question was hidden you ought to have\nreported it to the proper authorities.",
    "It was a pure accident I said.",
    "The idea just happened to\noccur to me.",
    "And thats a likely tale.",
    "Nearly threequarters of a mile of\nwoodland and you go right to the proper spot and lay your hand\nupon it.",
    "I would have given Inspector Slack the steps in reasoning which\nled me to this particular spot but he had achieved his usual\nresult of putting my back up.",
    "I said nothing.",
    "Well said Inspector Slack eyeing the suitcase with dislike\nand wouldbe indifference I suppose we might as well have a\nlook at whats inside.",
    "He had brought an assortment of keys and wire with him.",
    "The\nlock was a cheap affair.",
    "In a couple of seconds the case was\nopen.",
    "I dont know what we had expected to find \u2014 something sternly\nsensational I imagine.",
    "But the first thing that met our eyes was a\ngreasy plaid scarf.",
    "The inspector lifted it out.",
    "Next came a faded\ndark blue overcoat very much the worse for wear.",
    "A checked\ncap followed.",
    "A shoddy lot.",
    "said the inspector.",
    "A pair of boots very down at heel and battered came next.",
    "At the\nbottom of the suitcase was a parcel done up in newspaper.",
    "Fancy shirt I suppose said the inspector bitterly as he tore it\nopen.",
    "A moment later he had caught his breath in surprise.",
    "For inside the parcel were some demure little silver objects and\na round platter of the same metal.",
    "Miss Marple gave a shrill exclamation of recognition.",
    "The trencher salts she exclaimed.",
    "Colonel Protheroes\ntrencher salts and the Charles II tazza.",
    "Did you ever hear of\nsuch a thing\n\nThe inspector had got very red.",
    "So that was the game he muttered.",
    "Robbery.",
    "But I cant make\nit out.",
    "Theres been no mention of these things being missing.",
    "Perhaps they havent discovered the loss I suggested.",
    "I\npresume these valuable things would not have been kept out in\ncommon use.",
    "Colonel Protheroe probably kept them locked\naway in a safe.",
    "I must investigate this said the inspector.",
    "Ill go right up to\nOld Hall now.",
    "So thats why our Dr. Stone made himself scarce.",
    "What with the murder and one thing and another he was afraid\nwed get wind of his activities.",
    "As likely as not his belongings\nmight have been searched.",
    "He got the girl to hide them in the\nwood with a suitable change of clothing.",
    "He meant to come back\nby a roundabout route and go off with them one night whilst she\nstayed here to disarm suspicion.",
    "Well theres one thing to the\ngood.",
    "This lets him out over the murder.",
    "Hed nothing to do with\nthat.",
    "Quite a different game.",
    "He repacked the suitcase and took his departure refusing Miss\nMarples offer of a glass of sherry.",
    "Well thats one mystery cleared up I said with a sigh What\nSlack says is quite true there are no grounds for suspecting him\nof the murder.",
    "Everythings accounted for quite satisfactorily.",
    "It really would seem so said Miss Marple.",
    "Although one never\ncan be quite certain can one\n\nTheres a complete lack of motive I pointed out.",
    "Hed got\nwhat he came for and was clearing out.",
    "Yes.",
    "She was clearly not quite satisfied and I looked at her in some\ncuriosity.",
    "She hastened to answer my inquiring gaze with a kind\nof apologetic eagerness.",
    "Ive no doubt I am quite wrong.",
    "Im so stupid about these things.",
    "But I just wondered \u2014 I mean this silver is very valuable is it\nnot\n\nA tazza sold the other day for over a thousand pounds I\nbelieve.",
    "I mean \u2014 its not the value of the metal.",
    "No its what one might can a connoisseurs value.",
    "Thats what I mean.",
    "The sale of such things would take a little\ntime to arrange or even if it was arranged it couldnt be carried\nthrough without secrecy.",
    "I mean \u2014 if the robbery were reported\n\n\fand a hue and cry were raised well the things couldnt be\nmarketed at all.",
    "I dont quite see what you mean I said.",
    "I know Im putting it badly.",
    "She became more flustered and\napologetic.",
    "But it seems to me that \u2014 that the things couldnt\njust have been abstracted so to speak.",
    "The only satisfactory\nthing to do would be to replace these things with copies.",
    "Then\nperhaps the robbery wouldnt be discovered for some time.",
    "Thats a very ingenious idea I said.",
    "It would be the only way to do it wouldnt it And if so of\ncourse\n\nas\n\nyou\n\nsay\n\nonce\n\nthe\n\nsubstitution\n\nhad\n\nbeen\n\naccomplished there wouldnt have been any reason for\nmurdering Colonel Protheroe \u2014 quite the reverse.",
    "Exactly I said.",
    "Thats what I said.",
    "Yes but I just wondered \u2014 I dont know of course \u2014 and\nColonel Protheroe always talked a lot about doing things before\nhe actually did do them and of course sometimes never did\nthem all but he did say \u2014\n\nYes\n\nThat he was going to have all his things valued \u2014 a man down\nfrom London.",
    "For probate \u2014 no thats when youre dead \u2014 for\ninsurance.",
    "Someone told him that was the thing to do.",
    "He talked\nabout it a great deal and the importance of having it done.",
    "Of\ncourse I dont know if he had made any actual arrangements\nbut if he had .",
    ". .",
    "I see I said slowly.",
    "Of course the moment the expert saw the silver hed know and\nthen Colonel Protheroe would remember having shown the\nthings to Dr. Stone \u2014 I wonder if it was done then \u2014 legerdemain\ndont they call it So clever \u2014 and then well the fat would be in\nthe fire to use an oldfashioned expression.",
    "I see your idea I said.",
    "I think we ought to find out for certain.",
    "I went once more to the telephone.",
    "In a few minutes I was\nthrough to Old Hall and speaking to Anne Protheroe.",
    "No its nothing very important.",
    "Has the inspector arrived yet\nOh well hes on his way.",
    "Mrs. Protheroe can you tell me if the\ncontents of Old Hall were ever valued Whats that you say\n\nHer answer came clear and prompt.",
    "I thanked her replaced the\nreceiver and turned to Miss Marple.",
    "Thats very definite.",
    "Colonel Protheroe had made arrangements\nfor a man to come down from London on Monday \u2014 tomorrow \u2014\nto make a full valuation.",
    "Owing to the colonels death the matter\nhas been put off.",
    "Then there was a motive said Miss Marple softly.",
    "A motive yes.",
    "But thats all.",
    "You forget.",
    "When the shot was\nfired Dr. Stone had just joined the others or was climbing over\nthe stile in order to do so.",
    "Yes said Miss Marple thoughtfully So that rules him out.",
    "Chapter XXIV\n\nI returned to the Vicarage to find Hawes waiting for me in my\nstudy.",
    "He was pacing up and down nervously and when I\nentered the room he started as though he had been shot.",
    "You must excuse me he said wiping his forehead.",
    "My nerves\nare all to pieces lately.",
    "My dear fellow I said you positively must get away for a\nchange.",
    "We shall have you breaking down altogether and that\nwill never do.",
    "I cant desert my post.",
    "No that is a thing I will never do.",
    "Its not a case of desertion.",
    "You are ill. Im sure Haydock would\nagree with me.",
    "Haydock \u2014 Haydock.",
    "What kind of a doctor is he An ignorant\ncountry practitioner.",
    "I think youre unfair to him.",
    "He has always been considered a\nvery able man in his profession.",
    "Oh perhaps.",
    "Yes I daresay.",
    "But I dont like him.",
    "However\nthats not what I came to say.",
    "I came to ask you if you would be\nkind enough to preach tonight instead of me.",
    "I \u2014 I really do not\nfeel equal to it.",
    "Why certainly.",
    "I will take the service for you.",
    "No no.",
    "I wish to take the service.",
    "I am perfectly fit.",
    "It is only the\nidea of getting up in the pulpit of all those eyes staring at me .",
    ".\n.",
    "He shut his eyes and swallowed convulsively.",
    "It is clear to me that there is something very wrong indeed the\nmatter with Hawes.",
    "He seemed aware of my thoughts for he\nopened his eyes and said quickly\n\nThere is nothing really wrong with me.",
    "It is just these\nheadaches \u2014 these awful racking headaches.",
    "I wonder if you\ncould let me have a glass of water.",
    "Certainly I said.",
    "I went and fetched it myself from the tap.",
    "Ringing bells is a\nprofitless form of exercise in our house.",
    "I brought the water to him and he thanked me.",
    "He took from his\npocket a small cardboard box and opening it extracted a rice\npaper capsule which he swallowed with the aid of the water.",
    "A headache powder he explained.",
    "I suddenly wondered whether Hawes might have become\naddicted to drugs.",
    "It would explain a great many of his\npeculiarities.",
    "You dont take too many I hope I said.",
    "No \u2014 oh no.",
    "Dr. Haydock warned me against that.",
    "But it is\nreally wonderful.",
    "They bring instant relief.",
    "Indeed he already seemed calmer and more composed.",
    "He stood up.",
    "Then you will preach tonight Its very good of you sir.",
    "Not at all.",
    "And I insist on taking the service too.",
    "Get along home\nand rest.",
    "No I wont have any argument.",
    "Not another word.",
    "He thanked me again.",
    "Then he said his eyes sliding past me to\nthe window\n\nYou \u2014 you have been up at Old Hall today havent you sir.",
    "Yes.",
    "Excuse me \u2014 but were you sent for\n\nI looked at him in surprise and he flushed.",
    "Im sorry sir.",
    "I \u2014 I just thought some new development might\nhave arisen and that that was why Mrs. Protheroe had sent for\nyou.",
    "I had not the faintest intention of satisfying Hawess curiosity.",
    "She wanted to discuss the funeral arrangements and one or\ntwo other small matters with me I said.",
    "Oh that was all.",
    "I see.",
    "I did not speak.",
    "He fidgeted from foot to foot and finally said\n\nMr. Redding came to see me last night.",
    "I \u2014 I cant imagine why.",
    "Didnt he tell you\n\nHe \u2014 he just said he thought hed look me up.",
    "Said it was a bit\nlonely in the evenings.",
    "Hes never done such a thing before.",
    "Well hes supposed to be pleasant company I said smiling.",
    "What does he want to come and see me for I dont like it.",
    "His\nvoice rose shrilly.",
    "He spoke of dropping in again.",
    "What does it\nall mean What idea do you think he has got into his head\n\nWhy should you suppose he has any ulterior motive I asked.",
    "I dont like it repeated Hawes obstinately.",
    "Ive never gone\nagainst him in any way.",
    "I never suggested that he was guilty \u2014\neven when he accused himself I said it seemed most\nincomprehensible.",
    "If Ive had suspicions of anybody its been of\nArcher \u2014 never of him.",
    "Archer is a totally different proposition\n\u2014 a godless irreligious ruffian.",
    "A drunken blackguard.",
    "Dont you think youre being a little harsh I said.",
    "After all we\nreally know very little about the man.",
    "A poacher in and out of prison capable of anything.",
    "Do you really think he shot Colonel Protheroe I asked\ncuriously.",
    "Hawes has an inveterate dislike of answering yes or no.",
    "I have\nnoticed it several times lately.",
    "Dont you think yourself sir that its the only possible solution\n\n\fAs far as we know I said theres no evidence of any kind\nagainst him.",
    "His threats said Hawes eagerly.",
    "You forget about his\nthreats.",
    "I am sick and tired of hearing about Archers threats.",
    "As far as I\ncan make out there is no direct evidence that he ever made any.",
    "He was determined to be revenged on Colonel Protheroe.",
    "He\nprimed himself with drink and then shot him.",
    "Thats pure supposition.",
    "But you will admit that its perfectly probable\n\nNo I dont.",
    "Possible then\n\nPossible yes.",
    "Hawes glanced at me sideways.",
    "Why dont you think its probable\n\nBecause I said a man like Archer wouldnt think of shooting\na man with a pistol.",
    "Its the wrong weapon.",
    "Hawes seemed taken aback by my argument.",
    "Evidently it wasnt\nthe objection he had expected.",
    "Do you really think the objection is feasible he asked\ndoubtingly.",
    "To my mind it is a complete stumbling block to Archers having\ncommitted the crime I said.",
    "In face of my positive assertion Hawes said no more.",
    "He\nthanked me again and left.",
    "I had gone as far as the front door with him and on the hall table\nI saw four notes.",
    "They had certain characteristics in common.",
    "The handwriting was almost unmistakably feminine they all bore\nthe words By hand Urgent and the only difference I could\nsee was that one was noticeably dirtier than the rest.",
    "Their similarity gave me a curious feeling of seeing \u2014 not\ndouble but quadruple.",
    "Mary came out of the kitchen and caught me staring at them.",
    "Come by hand since lunch time she volunteered.",
    "All but one.",
    "I found that in the box.",
    "I nodded gathered them up and took them into the study.",
    "The first one ran thus\n\n\fDEAR MR. CLEMENT \u2014 Something has come to my knowledge\nwhich I feel you ought to know.",
    "It concerns the death of poor\nColonel Protheroe.",
    "I should much appreciate your advice on the\nmatter \u2014 whether to go to the police or not.",
    "Since my dear\nhusbands death I have such a shrinking from every kind of\npublicity.",
    "Perhaps you could run in and see me for a few minutes\nthis afternoon.",
    "Yours sincerely\n\nMARTHA PRICE RIDLEY.",
    "I opened the second\n\nDEAR MR. CLEMENT \u2014 I am so troubled \u2014 so exercised in my\nmind \u2014 to know what I ought to do.",
    "Something has come to my\nears that I feel may be important.",
    "I have such a horror of being\n\n\fmixed up with the police in any way.",
    "I am so disturbed and\ndistressed.",
    "Would it be asking too much of you dear vicar to\ndrop in for a few minutes and solve my doubts and perplexities\nfor me in the wonderful way you always do\n\nForgive my troubling you\n\nYours very sincerely\n\nCAROLINE WETHERBY.",
    "The third I felt I could almost have recited beforehand.",
    "DEAR MR CLEMENT \u2014 Something most important has come to\nmy ears.",
    "I feel you should be the first to know about it.",
    "Will you\ncall in and see me this afternoon some time.",
    "I will wait in for\nyou.",
    "This militant epistle was signed AMANDA HARTNELL.",
    "I opened the fourth missive.",
    "It has been my good fortune to be\ntroubled with very few anonymous letters.",
    "An anonymous letter\nis I think the meanest and cruellest weapon there is.",
    "This one\nwas no exception.",
    "It purported to be written by an illiterate\nperson but several things inclined me to disbelieve that\nassumption.",
    "DEAR VICAR \u2014 I think you ought to know what is Going On.",
    "Your lady has been seen coming out of Mr. Reddings cottage in\na surreptitious manner.",
    "You know wot i mean.",
    "The two are\nCarrying On together.",
    "i think you ought to know.",
    "A FRIEND.",
    "I made a faint exclamation of disgust and crumpling up the paper\ntossed it into the open grate just as Griselda entered the room.",
    "Whats that youre throwing down so contemptuously she\nasked.",
    "Filth I said.",
    "Taking a match from my pocket I struck it and bent down.",
    "Griselda however was too quick for me.",
    "She had stooped down\nand caught up the crumpled ball of paper and smoothed it out\nbefore I could stop her.",
    "She read it gave a little exclamation of disgust and tossed it\nback to me turning away as she did so.",
    "I lighted it and watched\nit burn.",
    "Griselda had moved away.",
    "She was standing by the window\nlooking out into the garden.",
    "Len she said without turning round.",
    "Yes my dear.",
    "Id like to tell you something.",
    "Yes dont stop me.",
    "I want to\nplease.",
    "When \u2014 when Lawrence Redding came here I let you\nthink that I had only known him slightly before.",
    "That wasnt true.",
    "I\n\u2014 had known him rather well.",
    "In fact before I met you I had\nbeen rather in love with him.",
    "I think most people are with\nLawrence.",
    "I was \u2014 well absolutely silly about him at one time.",
    "I\ndont mean I wrote him compromising letters or anything idiotic\nlike they do in books.",
    "But I was rather keen on him once.",
    "Why didnt you tell me I asked.",
    "Oh because I dont know exactly except that \u2014 well youre\nfoolish in some ways.",
    "Just because youre so much older than I\nam you think that I \u2014 well that Im likely to like other people.",
    "I\nthought youd be tiresome perhaps about me and Lawrence\nbeing friends.",
    "Youre very clever at concealing things I said remembering\nwhat she had told me in that room less than a week ago and the\ningenuous natural way she had talked.",
    "Yes Ive always been able to hide things.",
    "In a way I like doing\nit.",
    "Her voice held a childlike ring of pleasure in it.",
    "But its quite true what I said.",
    "I didnt know about Anne and I\nwondered why Lawrence was so different not \u2014 well really not\nnoticing me.",
    "Im not used to it.",
    "There was a pause.",
    "You do understand Len said Griselda anxiously.",
    "Yes I said I understand.",
    "But did I\n\n\fChapter XXV\n\nI found it hard to shake off the impression left by the anonymous\nletter.",
    "Pitch soils.",
    "However I gathered up the other three letters glanced at my\nwatch and started out.",
    "I wondered very much what this might be that had come to the\nknowledge of three ladies simultaneously.",
    "I took it to be the\nsame piece of news.",
    "In this I was to realise that my psychology\nwas at fault.",
    "I cannot pretend that my calls took me past the police station.",
    "My\nfeet gravitated there of their own accord.",
    "I was anxious to know\nwhether Inspector Slack had returned from Old Hall.",
    "I found that he had and further that Miss Cram had returned\nwith him.",
    "The fair Gladys was seated in the police station\ncarrying off matters with a high hand.",
    "She denied absolutely\nhaving taken the suitcase to the woods.",
    "Just because one of these gossiping old cats has nothing better\nto do than look out of her window all night you go and pitch upon\nme.",
    "Shes been mistaken once remember when she said she\nsaw me at the end of the lane on the afternoon of the murder\nand if she was mistaken then in daylight how can she possibly\nhave recognised me by moonlight\n\nWicked it is the way these old ladies go on down here.",
    "Say\nanything they will.",
    "And me asleep in my bed as innocent as can\nbe.",
    "You ought to be ashamed of yourselves the lot of you.",
    "And supposing the landlady of the Blue Boar identifies the\nsuitcase as yours Miss Cram\n\nIf she says anything of the kind shes wrong.",
    "Theres no name\non it.",
    "Nearly everybodys got a suitcase like that.",
    "As for poor Dr.\nStone accusing him of being a common burglar And he has a lot\nof letters after his name.",
    "You refuse to give us any explanation then Miss Cram\n\nNo refusing about it.",
    "Youve made a mistake thats all.",
    "You and\nyour meddlesome Marples.",
    "I wont say a word more \u2014 not\nwithout my solicitor present.",
    "Im going this minute \u2014 unless\nyoure going to arrest me.",
    "For answer the inspector rose and opened the door for her and\nwith a toss of the head Miss Cram walked out.",
    "Thats the line she takes said Slack coming back to his chair.",
    "Absolute denial.",
    "And of course the old lady may have been\nmistaken.",
    "No jury would believe you could recognise any one\n\n\ffrom that distance on a moonlit night.",
    "And of course as I say\nthe old lady may have made a mistake.",
    "She may I said but I dont think she did.",
    "Miss Marple is\nusually right.",
    "Thats what makes her unpopular.",
    "The inspector grinned.",
    "Thats what Hurst says.",
    "Lord these villages\n\nWhat about the silver inspector\n\nSeemed to be perfectly in order.",
    "Of course that meant one lot\nor the other must be a fake.",
    "Theres a very good man in Much\nBenham an authority on old silver.",
    "Ive phoned over to him and\nsent a car to fetch him.",
    "Well soon know which is which.",
    "Either\nthe burglary was an accomplished fact or else it was only\nplanned.",
    "Doesnt make a frightful lot of difference either way \u2014 I\nmean as far as were concerned.",
    "Robberys a small business\ncompared with murder.",
    "These two arent concerned with the\n\n\fmurder.",
    "Well maybe get a line on him through the girl \u2014 thats\nwhy I let her go without any more fuss.",
    "I wondered I said.",
    "A pity about Mr. Redding.",
    "Its not often you find a man who goes\nout of his way to oblige you.",
    "I suppose not I said smiling slightly.",
    "Women cause a lot of trouble moralised the inspector.",
    "He sighed and then went on somewhat to my surprise Of\ncourse theres Archer.",
    "Oh I said.",
    "Youve thought of him\n\nWhy naturally sir first thing.",
    "It didnt need any anonymous\nletters to put me on his track.",
    "Anonymous letters I said sharply.",
    "Did you get one then\n\n\fThats nothing new sir.",
    "We get a dozen a day at least.",
    "Oh yes\nwe were put wise to Archer.",
    "As though the police couldnt look\nout for themselves Archers been under suspicion from the first.",
    "The trouble of it is hes got an alibi.",
    "Not that it amounts to\nanything but its awkward to get over.",
    "What do you mean by its not amounting to anything I asked.",
    "Well it appears he was with a couple of pals all the afternoon.",
    "Not as I say that that counts much.",
    "Men like Archer and his pals\nwould swear to anything.",
    "Theres no believing a word they say.",
    "We know that.",
    "But the public doesnt and the Jurys taken from\nthe public mores the pity.",
    "They know nothing and ten to one\nbelieve everything thats said in the witness box no matter who\nit is that says it.",
    "And of course Archer himself will swear till hes\nblack in the face that he didnt do it.",
    "Not so obliging as Mr. Redding I said with a smile.",
    "Not he said the inspector making the remark as a plain\nstatement of fact.",
    "It is natural I suppose to cling to life I mused.",
    "Youd be surprised if you knew the murderers that have got off\nthrough the softheartedness of the jury said the inspector\ngloomily.",
    "But do you really think that Archer did it I asked.",
    "It has struck me as curious all along that Inspector Slack never\nseems to have any personal views of his own on the murder.",
    "The\neasiness or difficulty of getting a conviction are the only points\nthat seem to appeal to him.",
    "Id like to be a bit surer.",
    "he admitted.",
    "A fingerprint now or a\nfootprint or seen in the vicinity about the time of the crime.",
    "Cant\nrisk arresting him without something of that kind.",
    "Hes been seen\nround Mr. Reddings house once or twice but hed say that was\nto speak to his mother.",
    "A decent body she is.",
    "No on the whole.",
    "Im for the lady.",
    "If I could only get definite proof of blackmail \u2014\nbut you cant get definite proof of anything in this crime Its\ntheory theory theory.",
    "Its a sad pity that theres not a single\nspinster lady living along your road Mr. Clement.",
    "I bet shed\nhave seen something if there had been.",
    "His words reminded me of my calls and I took leave of him.",
    "It\nwas about the solitary instance when I had seen him in a genial\nmood.",
    "My first call was on Miss Hartnell.",
    "She must have been watching\nfor me from the window for before I had time to ring she had\nopened the front door and clasping my hand firmly in hers had\nled me over the threshold.",
    "So good of you to come.",
    "In here.",
    "More private.",
    "We entered a microscopic room about the size of a hencoop.",
    "Miss Hartnell shut the door and with an air of deep secrecy\nwaved me to a seat there were only three.",
    "I perceived that she\nwas enjoying herself.",
    "Im never one to beat about the bush she said in her jolly\nvoice the latter slightly toned down to meet the requirements of\nthe situation.",
    "You know how things go the round in a village like\nthis.",
    "Unfortunately I said I do.",
    "I agree with you.",
    "Nobody dislikes gossip more than I do.",
    "But\nthere it is.",
    "I thought it my duty to tell the police inspector that Id\ncalled on Mrs. Lestrange the afternoon of the murder and that\nshe was out.",
    "I dont expect to be thanked for doing my duty I just\ndo it.",
    "Ingratitude is what you meet with first and last in this life.",
    "Why only yesterday that impudent Mrs. Baker \u2014\n\nYes yes I said hoping to avert the usual tirade.",
    "Very sad\nvery sad.",
    "But you were saying.",
    "The lower classes dont know who are their best friends said\nMiss Hartnell.",
    "I always say a word in season when Im visiting.",
    "Not that Im ever thanked for it.",
    "You were telling the inspector about your call upon Mrs.\nLestrange I prompted.",
    "Exactly \u2014 and by the way he didnt thank me.",
    "Said hed ask for\ninformation when he wanted it \u2014 not those words exactly but\nthat was the spirit.",
    "Theres a different class of men in the police\nforce nowadays.",
    "Very probably I said.",
    "But you were going on to say\nsomething\n\nI decided that this time I wouldnt go near any wretched\ninspector.",
    "After all a clergyman is a gentleman \u2014 at least some\nare she added.",
    "I gathered that the qualification was intended to include me.",
    "If I can help you in any way I began.",
    "Its a matter of duty said Miss Hartnell and closed her mouth\nwith a snap.",
    "I dont want to have to say these things.",
    "No one\nlikes it less.",
    "But duty is duty.",
    "I waited.",
    "Ive been given to understand went on Miss Hartnell turning\nrather red that Mrs. Lestrange gives out that she was at home\nall the time \u2014 that she didnt answer the door because \u2014 well\nbecause she didnt choose.",
    "Such airs and graces.",
    "I only called\nas a matter of duty and to be treated like that\n\nShe has been ill I said mildly.",
    "Ill Fiddlesticks.",
    "Youre too unworldly Mr. Clement.",
    "Theres\nnothing the matter with that woman.",
    "Too ill to attend the inquest\nindeed Medical certificate from Dr. Haydock She can wind him\nround her little finger every one knows that.",
    "Well where was I\n\n\fI didnt quite know.",
    "It is difficult with Miss Hartnell to know where\nnarrative ends and vituperation begins.",
    "Oh about calling on her that afternoon.",
    "Well its fiddlesticks to\nsay she was in the house.",
    "She wasnt.",
    "I know.",
    "How can you possibly know\n\nMiss Hartnells face turned a little redder.",
    "In some one less\ntruculent her demeanour might have been called embarrassed.",
    "Id knocked and rung she explained.",
    "Twice.",
    "If not three\ntimes.",
    "And it occurred to me suddenly that the bell might be out\nof order.",
    "She was I was glad to note unable to look me in the face when\nsaying this.",
    "The same builder builds all our houses and the bells\nhe installs are always clearly audible when standing on the mat\noutside the front door.",
    "Both Miss Hartnell and I knew this\nperfectly well but I suppose decencies have to be preserved.",
    "Yes I murmured.",
    "I didnt want to push my card through the letter box.",
    "That would\nseem so rude and whatever I am I am never rude.",
    "She made this amazing statement without a tremor.",
    "So I thought I would just go round the house and \u2014 and tap on\nthe window pane she continued unblushingly.",
    "I went all round\nthe house and looked in at all the windows but there was no one\nin the house at all.",
    "I understood her perfectly.",
    "Taking advantage of the fact that the\nhouse was empty Miss Hartnell had given unbridled rein to her\ncuriosity and had gone round the house examining the garden\nand peering in at all the windows to see as much as she could of\nthe interior.",
    "She had chosen to tell her story to me believing that\nI should be a more sympathetic and lenient audience than the\npolice.",
    "The clergy are supposed to give the benefit of the doubt\nto their parishioners.",
    "I made no comment on the situation.",
    "I merely asked a question.",
    "What time was this Miss Hartnell\n\nAs far as I can remember said Miss Hartnell it must have\nbeen close on six oclock.",
    "I went straight home afterwards and I\ngot in about ten past six and Mrs. Protheroe came in somewhere\nround about the halfhour leaving Dr. Stone and Mr. Redding\noutside and we talked about bulbs.",
    "And all the time the poor\ncolonel lying murdered.",
    "Its a sad world.",
    "It is sometimes a rather unpleasant one I said.",
    "I rose.",
    "And that is all you have to tell me\n\nI just thought it might be important.",
    "It might I agreed.",
    "And refusing to be drawn further much to Miss Hartnells\ndisappointment I took my leave.",
    "Miss Wetherby whom I visited next received me in a kind of\nflutter.",
    "Dear vicar how truly kind.",
    "Youve had tea Really you wont A\ncushion for your back It is so kind of you to come round so\npromptly.",
    "Always willing to put yourself out for others.",
    "There was a good deal of this before we came to the point and\neven then it was approached with a good deal of circumlocution.",
    "You must understand that I heard this on the best authority.",
    "In St. Mary Mead the best authority is always somebody elses\nservant.",
    "You cant tell me who told you\n\n\fI promised dear Mr. Clement.",
    "And I always think a promise\nshould be a sacred thing.",
    "She looked very solemn.",
    "Shall we say a little bird told me That is safe isnt it\n\nI longed to say Its damned silly.",
    "I rather wish I had.",
    "I should\nhave liked to observe the effect on Miss Wetherby.",
    "Well this little bird told that she saw a certain lady who shall be\nnameless.",
    "Another kind of bird I inquired.",
    "To my great surprise Miss Wetherby went off into paroxysms of\nlaughter and tapped me playfully on the arm saying\n\nOh vicar you must not be so naughty.",
    "When she had recovered she went on.",
    "A certain lady and where do you think this certain lady was\ngoing She turned into the Vicarage road but before she did so\nshe looked up and down the road in a most peculiar way \u2014 to\nsee if any one she knew were noticing her I imaging.",
    "And the little bird \u2014 I inquired.",
    "Paying a visit to the fishmongers \u2014 in the room over the shop.",
    "I now know where maids go on their days out.",
    "I know there is one\nplace they never go if they can help \u2014 anywhere in the open air.",
    "And the time continued Miss Wetherby leaning forward\nmysteriously was just before six oclock.",
    "On which day\n\nMiss Wetherby gave a little scream.",
    "The day of the murder of course didnt I say so\n\n\fI inferred it I replied.",
    "And the name of the lady\n\nBegins with an L said Wetherby nodding her head several\ntimes.",
    "Feeling that I had got to the end of the information Miss\nWetherby had to import I rose to my feet.",
    "You wont let the police crossquestion me will you said Miss\nWetherby pathetically as she clasped my hand in both of hers.",
    "I do shrink from publicity.",
    "And to stand up in court\n\nIn special cases I said they let witnesses sit down.",
    "And I escaped.",
    "There was still Mrs. Price Ridley to see.",
    "That lady put me in my\nplace at once.",
    "I will not be mixed up in any police court business she said\nfirmly after shaking my hand coldly.",
    "You understand that on\nthe other hand having come across a circumstance which\nneeds explaining I think it should be brought to the notice of the\nauthorities.",
    "Does it concern Mrs. Lestrange I asked.",
    "Why should it demanded Mrs. Price Ridley coldly.",
    "She had me at a disadvantage there.",
    "Its a very simple matter she continued.",
    "My maid Clara was\nstanding at the front gate she went down there for a minute or\ntwo \u2014 she says to get a breath of fresh air.",
    "Most unlikely I\nshould say.",
    "Much more probable that she was looking out for the\nfishmongers boy \u2014 if he calls himself a boy \u2014 impudent young\njackanapes thinks because hes seventeen he can joke with all\nthe girls.",
    "Anyway as I say she was standing at the gate and she\nheard a sneeze.",
    "Yes I said waiting for more.",
    "Thats all.",
    "I tell you she heard a sneeze.",
    "And dont start telling\nme Im not so young as I once was and may have made a\nmistake because it was Clara who heard it and shes only\nnineteen.",
    "But I said why shouldnt she have heard a sneeze\n\nMrs. Price Ridley looked at me in obvious pity for my poorness of\nintellect.",
    "She heard a sneeze on the day of the murder at a time when\nthere was no one in your house.",
    "Doubtless the murderer was\nconcealed in the bushes waiting his opportunity.",
    "What you have\nto look for is a man with a cold in his head.",
    "Or a sufferer from hay fever I suggested.",
    "But as a matter of\nfact Mrs. Price Ridley I think that mystery has a very easy\nsolution.",
    "Our maid Mary has been suffering from a severe cold\n\n\fin the head.",
    "In fact her sniffing has tried us very much lately.",
    "It\nmust have been her sneeze your maid heard.",
    "It was a mans sneeze said Mrs. Price Ridley firmly.",
    "And you\ncouldnt hear your maid sneeze in your kitchen from our gate.",
    "You couldnt hear any one sneezing in the study from your\ngate I said.",
    "Or at least I very much doubt it.",
    "I said the man might have been concealed in the shrubbery\nsaid Mrs. Price Ridley.",
    "Doubtless when Clara had gone in he\neffected an entrance by the front door.",
    "Well of course thats possible I said.",
    "I tried not to make my voice consciously soothing but I must\nhave failed for Mrs. Price Ridley glared at me suddenly.",
    "I am accustomed not to be listened to but I might mention also\nthat to leave a tennis racquet carelessly flung down on the grass\n\n\fwithout a press completely ruins it.",
    "And tennis racquets are very\nexpensive nowadays.",
    "There did not seem to be rhyme or reason in this flank attack.",
    "It\nbewildered me utterly.",
    "But perhaps you dont agree said Mrs. Price Ridley.",
    "Oh I do \u2014 certainly.",
    "I am glad.",
    "Well that is all I have to say.",
    "I wash my hands of the\nwhole affair.",
    "She leaned back and closed her eyes like one weary of this\nworld.",
    "I thanked her and said goodbye.",
    "On the doorstep I ventured to ask Clara about her mistresss\nstatement.",
    "Its quite true sir I heard a sneeze.",
    "And it wasnt an ordinary\nsneeze \u2014 not by any means.",
    "Nothing about a crime is ever ordinary.",
    "The shot was not an\nordinary kind of shot.",
    "The sneeze was not a usual kind of sneeze.",
    "It was I presume a special murderers sneeze.",
    "I asked the girl\nwhat time this had been but she was very vague some time\nbetween a quarter and halfpast six she thought.",
    "Anyway it was\nbefore the mistress had the telephone call and was took bad.",
    "I asked her if she had heard a shot of any kind.",
    "And she said the\nshots had been something awful.",
    "After that I placed very little\ncredence in her statements.",
    "I was just turning in at my own gate when I decided to pay a\nfriend a visit.",
    "Glancing at my watch I saw that I had just time for it before\ntaking Evensong.",
    "I went down the road to Haydocks house.",
    "He\ncame out on the doorstep to meet me.",
    "I noticed afresh how worried and haggard he looked.",
    "This\nbusiness seemed to have aged him out of all knowledge.",
    "Im glad to see you he said.",
    "Whats the news\n\nI told him the latest Stone development.",
    "A highclass thief he commented.",
    "Well that explains a lot of\nthings.",
    "Hed read up his subject but he made slips from time to\ntime to me.",
    "Protheroe must have caught him out once.",
    "You\nremember the row they had.",
    "What do you think about the girl Is\nshe in it too\n\nOpinion as to that is undecided I said.",
    "For my own part I\nthink the girl is all right.",
    "Shes such a prize idiot I added.",
    "Oh I wouldnt say that.",
    "Shes rather shrewd is Miss Gladys\nCram.",
    "A remarkably healthy specimen.",
    "Not likely to trouble\nmembers of my profession.",
    "I told him that I was worried about Hawes and that I was anxious\nthat he should get away for a real rest and change.",
    "Something evasive came into his manner when I said this.",
    "His\nanswer did not ring quite true.",
    "Yes he said slowly.",
    "I suppose that would be the best thing.",
    "Poor chap.",
    "Poor chap.",
    "I thought you didnt like him.",
    "I dont \u2014 not much.",
    "But Im sorry for a lot of people I dont like.",
    "He added after a minute or two Im even sorry for Protheroe.",
    "Poor fellow \u2014 nobody ever liked him much.",
    "Too full of his own\nrectitude and too selfassertive.",
    "Its an unlovable mixture.",
    "He\nwas always the same \u2014 even as a young man.",
    "I didnt know you knew him then\n\nOh yes When he lived in Westmoreland I had a practice not\nfar away.",
    "Thats a long time ago now.",
    "Nearly twenty years.",
    "I sighed.",
    "Twenty years ago Griselda was five years old.",
    "Time is\nan odd thing .",
    ". .\n\nIs that all you came to say to me Clement\n\nI looked up with a start.",
    "Haydock was watching me with keen\neyes.",
    "Theres something else isnt there he said.",
    "I nodded.",
    "I had been uncertain whether to speak or not when I came in but\nnow I decided to do so.",
    "I like Haydock as well as any man I know.",
    "He is a splendid fellow in every way.",
    "I felt that what I had to tell\nmight be useful to him.",
    "I recited my interviews with Miss Hartnell and Miss Wetherby.",
    "He was silent for a long time after Id spoken.",
    "Its quite true Clement he said at last.",
    "Ive been trying to\nshield Mrs. Lestrange from any inconvenience that I could.",
    "As a\nmatter of fact shes an old friend.",
    "But thats not my only reason.",
    "That medical certificate of mine isnt the putup job you all think\nit was.",
    "He paused and then said gravely\n\nThis is between you and me Clement.",
    "Mrs. Lestrange is\ndoomed.",
    "What\n\nShes a dying woman.",
    "I give her a month at longest.",
    "Do you\nwonder that I want to keep her from being badgered and\nquestioned\n\nHe went on\n\n\fWhen she turned into this road that evening it was here she\ncame \u2014 to this house.",
    "You havent said so before.",
    "I didnt want to create talk.",
    "Six to seven isnt my time for seeing\npatients and every one knows that.",
    "But you can take my word\nfor it that she was here.",
    "She wasnt here when I came for you though.",
    "I mean when we\ndiscovered the body.",
    "No he seemed perturbed.",
    "Shed left \u2014 to keep an\nappointment.",
    "In what direction was the appointment In her own house\n\nI dont know Clement.",
    "On my honour I dont know.",
    "I believed him but \u2014\n\n\fAnd supposing an innocent man is hanged I said.",
    "He shook his head.",
    "No he said.",
    "No one will be hanged for the murder of Colonel\nProtheroe.",
    "You can take my word for that.",
    "But that is just what I could not do.",
    "And yet the certainty in his\nvoice was very great.",
    "No one will be hanged he repeated.",
    "This man Archer \u2014\n\nHe made an impatient movement.",
    "Hasnt got brains enough to wipe his fingerprints off the pistol.",
    "Perhaps not I said dubiously.",
    "Then I remembered something and taking the little brownish\ncrystal I had found in the wood from my pocket I held it out to\nhim and asked him what it was.",
    "Hm he hesitated.",
    "Looks like picric acid.",
    "Where did you find\nit\n\nThat I replied is Sherlock Holmess secret.",
    "He smiled.",
    "What is picric acid\n\nWell its an explosive.",
    "Yes I know that but its got another use hasnt it\n\nHe nodded.",
    "Its used medically \u2014 in solution for burns.",
    "Wonderful stuff.",
    "I held out my hand and rather reluctantly he handed it back to\nme.",
    "Its of no consequence probably I said.",
    "But I found it in rather\nan unusual place.",
    "You wont tell me where\n\nRather childishly I wouldnt.",
    "He had his secrets.",
    "Well I would have mine.",
    "I was a little hurt that he had not confided in me more fully.",
    "Chapter XXVI\n\nI was in a strange mood when I mounted the pulpit that night.",
    "The church was unusually full.",
    "I cannot believe that it was the\nprospect of Hawes preaching which had attracted so many.",
    "Hawess sermons are dull and dogmatic.",
    "And if the news had got\nround that I was preaching instead that would not have\nattracted them either.",
    "For my sermons are dull and scholarly.",
    "Neither I am afraid can I attribute it to devotion.",
    "Everybody had come I concluded to see who else was there\nand possibly to exchange a little gossip in the church porch\nafterwards.",
    "Haydock was in church which is unusual and also Lawrence\nRedding.",
    "And to my surprise beside Lawrence I saw the white\nstrained face of Hawes.",
    "Anne Protheroe was there but she\nusually attends Evensong on Sundays though I had hardly\nthought she would today.",
    "I was far more surprised to see Lettice.",
    "Churchgoing was compulsory on Sunday morning \u2014 Colonel\nProtheroe was adamant on that point but I had never seen\nLettice at evening service before.",
    "Gladys Cram was there looking rather blatantly young and\nhealthy against a background of wizened spinsters and I\nfancied that a dim figure at the end of the church who had\nslipped in late was Mrs. Lestrange.",
    "I need hardly say that Mrs. Price Ridley Miss Hartnell Miss\nWetherby and Miss Marple were there in full force.",
    "All the village\npeople were there with hardly a single exception.",
    "I dont know\nwhen we have had such a crowded congregation.",
    "Crowds are queer things.",
    "There was a magnetic atmosphere\nthat night and the first person to feel its influence was myself.",
    "As a rule I prepare my sermons beforehand.",
    "I am careful and\nconscientious over them but no one is better aware than myself\nof their deficiencies.",
    "Tonight I was of necessity preaching extempore and as I looked\ndown on the sea of upturned faces a sudden madness entered\nmy brain.",
    "I ceased to be in any sense a Minister of God.",
    "I became\nan actor.",
    "I had an audience before me and I wanted to move that\naudience \u2014 and more I felt the power to move it.",
    "I am not proud of what I did that night.",
    "I am an utter disbeliever\nin the emotional Revivalist spirit.",
    "Yet that night I acted the part of\na raving ranting evangelist.",
    "I gave out my text slowly.",
    "I came not to call the righteous but sinners to repentance.",
    "I repeated it twice and I heard my own voice a resonant ringing\nvoice unlike the voice of the everyday Leonard Clement.",
    "I saw Griselda from her front pew look up in surprise and Dennis\nfollow her example.",
    "I held my breath for a moment or too and then I let myself rip.",
    "The congregation in that church were in a state of pentup\nemotion ripe to be played upon.",
    "I played upon them.",
    "I exhorted\nsinners to repentance.",
    "I lashed myself into a kind of emotional\nfrenzy.",
    "Again and again I threw out a denouncing hand and\nreiterated the phrase.",
    "I am speaking to you .",
    ". .\n\nAnd each time from different parts of the church a kind of\nsighing gasp went up.",
    "Mass emotion is a strange and terrible thing.",
    "I finished up with those beautiful and poignant words \u2014 perhaps\nthe most poignant words in the whole Bible\n\nThis night thy soul shall be required of thee .",
    ". .",
    "It was a strange brief possession.",
    "When I got back to the\nVicarage I was my usual faded indeterminate self.",
    "I found\nGriselda rather pale.",
    "She slipped her arm through mine.",
    "Len she said you were rather terrible tonight.",
    "I \u2014 I didnt\nlike it.",
    "Ive never heard you preach like that before.",
    "I dont suppose you ever will again I said sinking down\nwearily on the sofa.",
    "I was tired.",
    "What made you do it\n\nA sudden madness came over me.",
    "Oh it \u2014 it wasnt something special\n\nWhat do you mean \u2014 something special\n\nI wondered \u2014 that was all.",
    "Youre very unexpected Len.",
    "I never\nfeel I really know you.",
    "We sat down to cold supper Mary being out.",
    "Theres a note for you in the hall said Griselda.",
    "Get it will\nyou Dennis\n\nDennis who had been very silent obeyed.",
    "I took it and groaned.",
    "Across the top lefthand corner was\nwritten By hand \u2014 Urgent.",
    "This I said must be from Miss Marple.",
    "Theres no one else\nleft.",
    "I had been perfectly correct in my assumption.",
    "DEAR MR. CLEMENT \u2014 I should so much like to have a little\nchat with you about one or two things that have occurred to me.",
    "I\nfeel we should all try and help in elucidating this sad mystery I\nwill come over about halfpast nine if I may and tap on your\n\n\fstudy window.",
    "Perhaps dear Griselda would be so very kind as\nto run over here and cheer up my nephew.",
    "And Mr. Dennis too\nof course if he cares to come.",
    "If I do not hear I will expect them\nand will come over myself at the time I have stated.",
    "Yours very sincerely\n\nJANE MARPLE.",
    "I handed the note to Griselda.",
    "Oh well go she said cheerfully.",
    "A glass or two of homemade\nliqueur is just what one needs on Sunday evening.",
    "I think its\nMarys blanc mange that is so frightfully depressing.",
    "Its like\nsomething out of a mortuary.",
    "Dennis seemed less charmed at the prospect.",
    "Its all very well for you he grumbled.",
    "You can talk all this\nhighbrow stuff about art and books.",
    "I always feel a perfect fool\nsitting and listening to you.",
    "Thats good for you said Griselda serenely.",
    "It puts you in your\nplace.",
    "Anyway I dont think Mr. Raymond West is so frightfully\nclever as he pretends to be.",
    "Very few of us are I said.",
    "I wondered very much what exactly it was that Miss Marple\nwished to talk over.",
    "Of all the ladies in my congregation I\nconsider her by far the shrewdest.",
    "Not only does she see and\nhear practically everything that goes on but she draws\namazingly neat and apposite deductions from the facts that\ncome under her notice.",
    "If I were at any time to set out on a career of deceit it would be\nof Miss Marple that I should be afraid.",
    "What Griselda called the Nephew Amusing Party started off at a\nlittle after nine and whilst I was waiting for Miss Marple to arrive\nI amused myself by drawing up a kind of schedule of the facts\nconnected with the crime.",
    "I arranged them so far as possible in\nchronological order.",
    "I am not a punctual person but I am a neat\none and I like things jotted down in a methodical fashion.",
    "At halfpast nine punctually there was a little tap on the window\nand I rose and admitted Miss Marple.",
    "She had a very fine Shetland shawl thrown over her head and\nshoulders and was looking rather old and frail.",
    "She came in full\nof little fluttering remarks.",
    "So good of you to let me come \u2014 and so good of dear Griselda\n\u2014 Raymond admires her so much \u2014 the perfect Greuze he\nalways calls her .",
    ". . Shall I sit here I am not taking your chair\nOh thank you. . . . No I wont have a footstool.",
    "I deposited the Shetland shawl on a chair and returned to take a\nchair facing my guest.",
    "We looked at each other and a little\ndeprecating smile broke out on her face.",
    "I feel that you must be wondering why \u2014 why I am so interested\nin all this.",
    "You may possibly think its very unwomanly.",
    "No \u2014\nplease \u2014 I should like to explain if I may.",
    "She paused a moment a pink colour suffusing her cheeks.",
    "You see she began at last living alone as I do in a rather\noutoftheway part of the world one has to have a hobby.",

    "One\n\n\ftakes a little problem \u2014 for instance the gill of picked shrimps\nthat amused dear Griselda so much \u2014 a quite unimportant\nmystery but absolutely incomprehensible unless one solves it\nright.",
    "And then there was that matter of the changed cough\ndrops and the butchers wifes umbrella \u2014 the last absolutely\nmeaningless unless on the assumption that the greengrocer was\nnot behaving at all nicely with the chemists wife \u2014 which of\ncourse turned out to be the case.",

    "I mean \u2014 just solve it correctly.",
    "Logically it\nought to be exactly the same thing.",
    "After all a tiny working\nmodel of a torpedo is just the same as a real torpedo.",
    "You mean its all a question of relativity I said slowly.",
    "It should\nbe \u2014 logically I admit.",
    "But I dont know whether it really is.",
    "Surely it must be the same said Miss Marple.",
    "The \u2014 what one\nused to call the factors at school \u2014 are the same.",
    "Theres\nmoney and mutual attraction between people of an \u2014 er \u2014\nopposite sex \u2014 and theres queerness of course \u2014 so many\npeople are a little queer arent they \u2014 in fact most people are\nwhen you know them well.",

    "NOTE.",
    "\u2014 The only two people who have no kind of alibi for 6.306.35 are Miss Cram and Mrs. Lestrange.",
    "Miss Cram says she was\n\n\fat the barrow but no confirmation.",
    "It seems reasonable\nhowever to dismiss her from case as there seems nothing to\nconnect her with it.",
    "Mrs. Lestrange left Dr. Haydocks house\nsome time after six to keep an appointment.",
    "Where was the\nappointment and with whom It could hardly have been with\nColonel Protheroe as he expected to be engaged with me.",
    "It is\ntrue that Mrs. Lestrange was near the spot at the time the crime\nwas committed but it seems doubtful what motive she could\nhave had for murdering him.",
    "She did not gain by his death and\nthe inspectors theory of blackmail I cannot accept.",
    "Mrs.\nLestrange is not that kind of woman.",
    "Also it seems unlikely that\nshe should have got hold of Lawrence Reddings pistol.",
    "Very clear said Miss Marple nodding her head in approval.",
    "Very clear indeed.",
    "Gentlemen always make such excellent\nmemoranda.",
    "You agree with what I have written I asked.",
    "Oh yes \u2014 you have put it all beautifully.",
    "I asked her the question then that I had been meaning to put all\nalong.",
    "Miss Marple I said.",
    "Who do you suspect You once said that\nthere were seven people.",
    "Quite that I should think said Miss Marple absently.",
    "I expect\nevery one of us suspects someone different.",
    "In fact one can see\nthey do.",
    "She didnt ask me who I suspected.",
    "The point is she said that one must provide an explanation\nfor everything.",
    "Each thing has got to be explained away\nsatisfactorily.",
    "If you have a theory that fits every fact \u2014 well\nthen it must be the right one.",
    "But thats extremely difficult.",
    "If it\nwasnt for that note \u2014\n\nThe note I said surprised.",
    "Yes you remember I told you.",
    "That note has worried me all\nalong.",
    "Its wrong somehow.",
    "Surely I said that is explained now.",
    "It was written at six\nthirtyfive and another hand \u2014 the murderers \u2014 put the\nmisleading 6.20 at the top.",
    "I think that is clearly established.",
    "But even then said Miss Marple its all wrong.",
    "But why\n\nListen.",
    "Miss Marple leant forward eagerly.",
    "Mrs. Protheroe\npassed my garden as I told you and she went as far as the\nstudy window and she looked in and she didnt see Colonel\nProtheroe.",
    "Because he was writing at the desk I said.",
    "And thats whats all wrong.",
    "That was at twenty past six.",
    "We\nagreed that he wouldnt sit down to say he couldnt wait any\n\n\flonger until after halfpast six \u2014 so why was he sitting at the\nwritingtable then\n\nI never thought of that I said slowly.",
    "Let us dear Mr. Clement just go over it again.",
    "Mrs. Protheroe\ncomes to the window and she thinks the room is empty \u2014 she\nmust have thought so because otherwise she would never have\ngone down to the studio to meet Mr. Redding.",
    "It wouldnt have\nbeen safe.",
    "The room must have been absolutely silent if she\nthought it was empty.",
    "And that leaves us three alternatives\ndoesnt it\n\nYou mean \u2014\n\nWell the first alternative would be that Colonel Protheroe was\ndead already \u2014 but I dont think thats the most likely one.",
    "To\nbegin with hed only been there about five minutes and she or I\nwould have heard the shot and secondly the same difficulty\nremains about his being at the writingtable.",
    "The second\nalternative is of course that he was sitting at the writingtable\n\n\fwriting a note but in that case it must have been a different note\naltogether.",
    "It cant have been to say he couldnt wait.",
    "And the\nthird \u2014\n\nYes I said.",
    "Well the third is of course that Mrs. Protheroe was right and\nthat the room was actually empty.",
    "You mean that after he had been shown in he went out again\nand came back later\n\nYes.",
    "But why should he have done that\n\nMiss Marple spread out her hands in a little gesture of\nhewilderment.",
    "That would mean looking at the case from an entirely different\nangle I said.",
    "One so often has to do that \u2014 about everything.",
    "Dont you think\nso\n\nI did not reply.",
    "I was going over carefully in my mind the three\nalternatives that Miss Marple had suggested.",
    "With a slight sigh the old lady rose to her feet.",
    "I must be getting back.",
    "I am very glad to have had this little chat\n\u2014 though we havent got very far have we\n\nTo tell you the truth I said as I fetched her shawl the whole\nthing seems to me a bewildering maze.",
    "Oh I wouldnt say that.",
    "I think on the whole one theory fits\nnearly everything.",
    "That is if you admit one coincidence and I\nthink one coincidence is allowable.",
    "More than one of course is\nunlikely.",
    "Do you really think that About the theory I mean I asked\nlooking at her.",
    "I admit that there is one flaw in my theory \u2014 one fact that I cant\nget over.",
    "Oh if only that note had been something quite different\n\u2014\n\nShe sighed and shook her head.",
    "She moved towards the window\nand absentmindedly reached up her hand and felt the rather\ndepressedlooking plant that stood in a stand.",
    "You know dear Mr. Clement this should be watered oftener.",
    "Poor thing it needs it badly.",
    "Your maid should water it every day.",
    "I suppose it is she who attends to it\n\nAs much I said as she attends to anything.",
    "A little raw at present suggested Miss Marple.",
    "Yes I said.",
    "And Griselda steadily refuses to attempt to cook\nher.",
    "Her idea is that only a thoroughly undesirable maid will\n\n\fremain with us.",
    "However Mary herself gave us notice the other\nday.",
    "Indeed.",
    "I always imagined she was very fond of you both.",
    "I havent noticed it I said.",
    "But as a matter of fact it was\nLettice Protheroe who upset her.",
    "Mary came back from the\ninquest in rather a temperamental state and found Lettice here\nand \u2014 well they had words.",
    "Oh said Miss Marple.",
    "She was just about to step through the\nwindow when she stopped suddenly and a bewildering series of\nchanges passed over her face.",
    "Oh dear she muttered to herself.",
    "I have been stupid.",
    "So that\nwas it.",
    "Perfectly possible all the time.",
    "I beg your pardon\n\nShe turned a worried face upon me.",
    "Nothing.",
    "An idea that has just occurred to me.",
    "I must go home\nand think things out thoroughly.",
    "Do you know I believe I have\nbeen extremely stupid \u2014 almost incredibly so.",
    "I find that hard to believe I said gallantly.",
    "I escorted her through the window and across the lawn.",
    "Can you tell me what it is that has occurred to you so\nsuddenly I asked.",
    "I would rather not just at present.",
    "You see there is still a\npossibility that I may be mistaken.",
    "But I do not think so.",
    "Here we\nare at my garden gate.",
    "Thank you so much.",
    "Please do not come\nany farther.",
    "Is the note still a stumbling block I asked as she passed\nthrough the gate and latched it behind her.",
    "She looked at me abstractedly.",
    "The note Oh of course that wasnt the real note.",
    "I never\nthought it was.",
    "Good night Mr. Clement.",
    "She went rapidly up the path to the house leaving me staring\nafter her.",
    "I didnt know what to think.",
    "Chapter XXVII\n\nGriselda and Dennis had not yet returned.",
    "I realised that the\nmost natural thing would have been for me to go up to the house\nwith Miss Marple and fetch them home.",
    "Both she and I had been\nso entirely taken up with our preoccupation over the mystery\n\n\fthat we had forgotten anybody existed in the world except\nourselves.",
    "I was just standing in the hall wondering whether I would not\neven now go over and join them when the door bell rang.",
    "I crossed over to it.",
    "I saw there was a letter in the box and\npresuming that this was the cause of the ring I took it out.",
    "As I did so however the bell rang again and I shoved the letter\nhastily into my pocket and opened the front door.",
    "It was Colonel Melchett.",
    "Hallo Clement.",
    "Im on my way home from town in the car.",
    "Thought Id just look in and see if you could give me a drink.",
    "Delighted I said.",
    "Come into the study.",
    "He pulled off the leather coat that he was wearing and followed\nme into the study.",
    "I fetched the whisky and soda and two\n\n\fglasses.",
    "Melchett was standing in front of the fireplace legs\nwide apart stroking his closelycropped moustache.",
    "Ive got one bit of news for you Clement.",
    "Most astounding thing\nyouve ever heard.",
    "But let that go for the minute.",
    "How are things\ngoing down here Any more old ladies hot on the scent\n\nTheyre not doing so badly I said.",
    "One of them at all events\nthinks shes got there.",
    "Our friend Miss Marple eh\n\nOur friend Miss Marple.",
    "Women like that always think they know everything said\nColonel Melchett.",
    "He sipped his whisky and soda appreciatively.",
    "Its probably unnecessary interference on my part asking I\nsaid.",
    "But I suppose somebody has questioned the fish boy.",
    "I\n\n\fmean if the murderer left by the front door theres a chance the\nboy may have seen him.",
    "Slack questioned him right enough said Melchett.",
    "But the boy\nsays he didnt meet anybody.",
    "Hardly likely he would.",
    "The\nmurderer wouldnt be exactly courting observation.",
    "Lots of\ncover by your front gate.",
    "He would have taken a look to see if the\nroad was clear.",
    "The boy had to call at the Vicarage at\nHaydocks and at Mrs. Price Ridleys.",
    "Easy enough to dodge\nhim.",
    "Yes I said I suppose it would be.",
    "On the other hand went on Melchett if by any chance that\nrascal Archer did the job and young Fred Jackson saw him\nabout the place I doubt very much whether hed let on.",
    "Archer is\na cousin of his.",
    "Do you seriously suspect Archer\n\n\fWell you know old Protheroe had his knife into Archer pretty\nbadly.",
    "Lots of bad blood between them.",
    "Leniency wasnt\nProtheroes strong point.",
    "No I said.",
    "He was a very ruthless man.",
    "What I say is said Melchett Live and let live.",
    "Of course the\nlaws the law but it never hurts to give a man the benefit of the\ndoubt.",
    "Thats what Protheroe never did.",
    "He prided himself on it I said.",
    "There was a pause and then I asked\n\nWhat is this astounding bit of news  you promised me\n\nWell it is astounding.",
    "You know that unfinished letter that\nProtheroe was writing when he was killed\n\nYes.",
    "We got an expert on it \u2014 to say whether the 6.20 was added by\na different hand.",
    "Naturally we sent up samples of Protheroes\nhandwriting.",
    "And do you know the verdict That letter was never\nwritten by Protheroe at all.",
    "You mean a forgery\n\nIts a forgery.",
    "The 6.20 they think is written in a different hand\nagain \u2014 but theyre not sure about that.",
    "The heading is in a\ndifferent ink but the letter itself is a forgery.",
    "Protheroe never\nwrote it.",
    "Are they certain\n\nWell theyre as certain as experts ever are.",
    "You know what an\nexpert is Oh but theyre sure enough.",
    "Amazing I said.",
    "Then a memory assailed me.",
    "Why I said I remember at the time Mrs. Protheroe said it\nwasnt like her husbands handwriting at all and I took no\nnotice.",
    "Really\n\nI thought it one of those silly remarks women will make.",
    "If there\nseemed one thing sure on earth it was that Protheroe had\nwritten that note.",
    "We looked at each other.",
    "Its curious I said slowly.",
    "Miss Marple was saying this evening\nthat that note was all wrong.",
    "Confound the woman she couldnt know more about it if she\nhad committed the murder herself.",
    "At that moment the telephone bell rang.",
    "There is a queer kind of\npsychology about a telephone bell.",
    "It rang now persistently and\nwith a kind of sinister significance.",
    "I went over and took up the receiver.",
    "This is the Vicarage I said.",
    "Whos speaking\n\nA strange highpitched hysterical voice came over the wire\n\nI want to confess it said.",
    "My God I want to confess.",
    "Hallo I said hallo.",
    "Look here youve cut me off.",
    "What number\nwas that\n\nA languid voice said it didnt know.",
    "It added that it was sorry I\nhad been troubled.",
    "I put down the receiver and turned to Melchett.",
    "You once said I remarked that you would go mad if any one\nelse accused themselves of the crime.",
    "What about it\n\n\fThat was someone who wanted to confess. . . . And the\nExchange has cut us off.",
    "Melchett dashed over and took up the receiver.",
    "Ill speak to them.",
    "Do I said.",
    "You may have some effect.",
    "Ill leave you to it.",
    "Im\ngoing out.",
    "Ive a fancy I recognized that voice.",
    "Chapter XXVIII\n\nI hurried down the village street.",
    "It was eleven oclock and at\neleven oclock on a Sunday night the whole village of St. Mary\n\n\fMead might be dead.",
    "I saw however a light in a first floor\nwindow as I passed and realising that Hawes was still up I\nstopped and rang the door bell.",
    "After what seemed a long time Hawess landlady Mrs. Sadler\nlaboriously unfastened two bolts a chain and turned a key and\npeered out at me suspiciously.",
    "Why its Vicar she exclaimed.",
    "Goodevening I said.",
    "I want to see Mr. Hawes.",
    "I see theres a\nlight in the window so hes up still.",
    "That may be.",
    "Ive not seen him since I took up his supper.",
    "Hes\nhad a quiet evening \u2014 no one to see him and hes not been out.",
    "I nodded and passing her went quickly up the stairs.",
    "Hawes has\na bedroom and sittingroom on the first floor.",
    "I passed into the latter.",
    "Hawes was lying back in a long chair\nasleep.",
    "My entrance did not wake him.",
    "An empty cachet box and\na glass of water halffull stood beside him.",
    "On the floor by his left foot was a crumpled sheet of paper with\nwriting on it.",
    "I picked it up and straightened it out.",
    "It began My dear Clement \u2014\n\nI read it through uttered an exclamation and shoved it into my\npocket.",
    "Then I bent over Hawes and studied him attentively.",
    "Next reaching for the telephone which stood by his elbow I\ngave the number of the Vicarage.",
    "Melchett must have been still\ntrying to trace the call for I was told that the number was\nengaged.",
    "Asking them to call me I put the instrument down\nagain.",
    "I put my hand into my pocket to look at the paper I had picked up\nonce more.",
    "With it I drew out the note that I had found in the\nletter box and which was still unopened.",
    "Its appearance was horribly familiar.",
    "It\n\nwas the same\n\nhandwriting as the anonymous letter that had come that\nafternoon.",
    "I tore it open.",
    "I read it once \u2014 twice \u2014 unable to realise its contents.",
    "I was beginning to read it a third time when the telephone rang.",
    "Like a man in a dream I picked up the receiver and spoke.",
    "Hallo\n\nHallo.",
    "Is that you Melchett\n\nYes where are you Ive traced that call.",
    "The number is \u2014\n\nI know the number.",
    "Oh good.",
    "Is that where you are speaking from\n\nYes.",
    "What about that confession\n\nIve got the confession all right.",
    "You mean youve got the murderer\n\nI had then the strongest temptation of my life.",
    "I looked at Hawes.",
    "I looked at the crumpled letter.",
    "I looked at the anonymous\nscrawl.",
    "I looked at the empty cachet box with the name of\nCherubim on it.",
    "I remembered a certain casual conversation.",
    "I made an immense effort.",
    "I \u2014 dont know I said.",
    "Youd better come round.",
    "And I gave him the address.",
    "Then I sat down in the chair opposite Hawes to think.",
    "I had two clear minutes in which to do so.",
    "In two minutes time Melchett would have arrived.",
    "I took up the anonymous letter and read it through again for the\nthird time.",
    "Then I closed my eyes and thought .",
    ". .\n\n\fChapter XXIX\n\nI dont know how long I sat there \u2014 only a few minutes in reality I\nsuppose.",
    "Yet it seemed as though an eternity had passed when I\nheard the door open and turning my head looked up to see\nMelchett entering the room.",
    "He stared at Hawes asleep in his chair then turned to me.",
    "Whats this Clement What does it all mean\n\nOf the two letters in my hand I selected one and passed it to him.",
    "He read it aloud in a low voice.",
    "MY DEAR CLEMENT \u2014 It is a peculiarly unpleasant thing that I\nhave to say.",
    "After all I think I prefer writing it.",
    "We can discuss it\nat a later date.",
    "It concerns the recent peculations.",
    "I am sorry to\nsay that I have satisfied myself beyond any possible doubt as to\n\n\fthe identity of the culprit.",
    "Painful as it is for me to have to accuse\nan ordained priest of the church my duty is only too painfully\nclear.",
    "An example must be made and \u2014\n\nHe looked at me questioningly.",
    "At this point the writing tailed off\nin an undistinguishable scrawl where death had overtaken the\nwriters hand.",
    "Melchett drew a deep breath then looked at Hawes.",
    "So thats the solution The one man we never even considered.",
    "And remorse drove him to confess\n\nHes been very queer lately I said.",
    "Suddenly Melchett strode across to the sleeping man with a\nsharp exclamation.",
    "He seized him by the shoulder and shook\nhim at first gently then with increasing violence.",
    "Hes not asleep Hes drugged Whats the meaning of this\n\nHis eye went to the empty cachet box.",
    "He picked it up.",
    "Has he \u2014\n\nI think so I said.",
    "He showed me these the other day.",
    "Told me\nhed been warned against an overdose.",
    "Its his way out poor\nchap.",
    "Perhaps the best way.",
    "Its not for us to judge him.",
    "But Melchett was Chief Constable of the County before anything\nelse.",
    "The arguments that appealed to me had no weight with\nhim.",
    "He had caught a murderer and he wanted his murderer\nhanged.",
    "In one second he was at the telephone jerking the receiver up\nand down impatiently until he got a reply.",
    "He asked for\nHaydocks number.",
    "Then there was a further pause during which\nhe stood his ear to the telephone and his eyes on the limp figure\nin the chair.",
    "Hallo \u2014 hallo \u2014 hallo \u2014 is that Dr. Haydocks Will the doctor\ncome round at once to High Street Mr. Hawes.",
    "Its urgent .",
    ". .\nwhats that .",
    ". . Well what number is it then .",
    ". . Oh sorry.",
    "He rang off fuming.",
    "Wrong number wrong number \u2014 always wrong numbers And\na mans life hanging on it.",
    "HALLO \u2014 you gave me the wrong\nnumber. . . .",
    "Yes \u2014 dont waste time \u2014 give me three nine \u2014\nnine not five.",
    "Another period of impatience \u2014 shorter this time.",
    "Hallo \u2014 is that you Haydock Melchett speaking.",
    "Come to 19\nHigh Street at once will you Hawes has taken some kind of\noverdose.",
    "At once man its vital.",
    "He rang off strode impatiently up and down the room.",
    "Why on earth you didnt get hold of the doctor at once Clement\nI cannot think.",
    "Your wits must have all gone wool gathering.",
    "Fortunately it never occurs to Melchett that any one can possibly\nhave any different ideas on conduct to those he holds himself I\nsaid nothing and he went on\n\nWhere did you find this letter\n\nCrumpled on the door \u2014 where it had fallen from his hand.",
    "Extraordinary business \u2014 that old maid was right about its\nbeing the wrong note we found.",
    "Wonder how she tumbled to\nthat.",
    "But what an ass the fellow was not to destroy this one.",
    "Fancy keeping it \u2014 the most damaging evidence you can\nimagine\n\nHuman nature is full of inconsistencies.",
    "If it werent I doubt if we should ever catch a murderer Sooner\nor later they always do some fool thing.",
    "Youre looking very\nunder the weather Clement.",
    "I suppose this has been the most\nawful shock to you\n\n\fIt has.",
    "As I say Hawes has been queer in his manner for some\ntime but I never dreamed \u2014\n\nWho would Hallo that sounds like a car.",
    "He went across to\nthe window pushing up the sash and leaning out.",
    "Yes its\nHaydock all right.",
    "A moment later the doctor entered the room.",
    "In a few succinct words Melchett explained the situation.",
    "Haydock is not a man who ever shows his feelings.",
    "He merely\nraised his eyebrows nodded and strode across to his patient.",
    "He felt his pulse raised the eyelid and looked intently at the eye.",
    "Then he turned to Melchett.",
    "Want to save him for the gallows he asked.",
    "Hes pretty far\ngone you know.",
    "It will be touch and go anyway.",
    "I doubt if I can\nbring him round.",
    "Do everything possible.",
    "Right.",
    "He busied himself with the case he had brought with him\npreparing a hypodermic injection which he injected into Hawess\narm.",
    "Then he stood up.",
    "Best thing is to run him into Much Benham \u2014 to the hospital\nthere.",
    "Give me a hand to get him down to the car.",
    "We both lent our assistance.",
    "As Haydock climbed into the\ndriving seat he threw a parting remark over his shoulder.",
    "You wont be able to hang him you know Melchett.",
    "You mean he wont recover\n\n\fMay or may not.",
    "I didnt mean that.",
    "I mean that even if he does\nrecover \u2014 well the poor devil wasnt responsible for his actions.",
    "I shall give evidence to that effect.",
    "What did he mean by that asked Melchett as we went upstairs\nagain.",
    "I explained that Hawes had been a victim of encephalitis\nlethargica.",
    "Sleepy sickness eh Always some good reason nowadays for\nevery dirty action thats done.",
    "Dont you agree\n\nScience is teaching us a lot.",
    "Science be damned \u2014 I beg your pardon Clement but all this\nnamby pambyism annoys me.",
    "Im a plain man.",
    "Well I suppose\nwed better have a look round here.",
    "But at this moment there was an interruption \u2014 and a most\namazing one.",
    "The door opened and Miss Marple walked into the\nroom.",
    "She was pink and somewhat flustered and seemed to realise\nour condition of bewilderment.",
    "So sorry \u2014 so very sorry \u2014 to intrude \u2014 goodevening Colonel\nMelchett.",
    "As I say I am so sorry but hearing that Mr. Hawes was\ntaken in I felt I must come round and see if I couldnt do\nsomething.",
    "She paused.",
    "Colonel Melchett was regarding her in a somewhat\ndisgusted fashion.",
    "Very kind of you Miss Marple he said dryly.",
    "But no need to\ntrouble.",
    "How did you know by the way\n\nIt was the question I had been yearning to ask\n\n\fThe telephone explained Miss Marple.",
    "So careless with their\nwrong numbers arent they You spoke to me first thinking I\nwas Dr. Haydock.",
    "My number is three five.",
    "So that was it I exclaimed.",
    "There is always some perfectly good and reasonable explanation\nfor Miss Marples omniscience.",
    "And so she continued.",
    "I just came round to see if I could be of\nany use.",
    "Very kind of you said Melchett again even more dryly this\ntime.",
    "But nothing to be done.",
    "Haydocks taken him off to\nhospital.",
    "Actually to hospital Oh thats a great relief I am so very glad\nto hear it.",
    "Hell be quite safe there.",
    "When you say nothing to be\ndone you dont mean that theres nothing to be done for him do\nyou You dont mean that he wont recover\n\n\fIts very doubtful I said.",
    "Miss Marples eyes had gone to the cachet box.",
    "I suppose he took an overdose she said.",
    "Melchett I think was In favour of being reticent.",
    "Perhaps I might\nhave been under other circumstances.",
    "But my discussion of the\ncase with Miss Marple was too fresh in my mind for me to have\nthe same view though I must admit that her rapid appearance\non the scene and eager curiosity repelled me slightly.",
    "You had better look at this I said and handed her Protheroes\nunfinished letter.",
    "She took it and read it without any appearance of surprise.",
    "You had already deduced something of the kind had you not I\nasked.",
    "Yes \u2014 yes indeed.",
    "May I ask you Mr. Clement what made you\ncome here this evening That is a point which puzzles me.",
    "You\nand Colonel Melchett \u2014 not at all what I should have expected.",
    "I explained the telephone call and that I believed I had\nrecognised Hawess voice.",
    "Miss Marple nodded thoughtfully.",
    "Very interesting.",
    "Very providential \u2014 if I may use the term.",
    "Yes\nit brought you here in the nick of time.",
    "In the nick of time for what I said bitterly.",
    "Miss Marple looked surprised.",
    "To save Mr. Hawess life of course.",
    "Dont you think I said that it might be better if Hawes didnt\nrecover Better for him \u2014 better for every one.",
    "We know the\ntruth now and \u2014\n\n\fI stopped \u2014 for Miss Marple was nodding her head with such a\npeculiar vehemence that it made me lose the thread of what I\nwas saying.",
    "Of course she said.",
    "Of course Thats what he wants you to\nthink That you know the truth \u2014 and that its best for every one\nas it is.",
    "Oh yes it all fits in \u2014 the letter and the overdose and\npoor Mr. Hawess state of mind and his confession.",
    "It all fits in \u2014\nbut its wrong .",
    ". .\n\nWe stared at her.",
    "Thats why I am so glad Mr. Hawes is safe \u2014 in hospital where\nno one can get at him.",
    "If he recovers hell tell you the truth.",
    "The truth\n\nYes \u2014 that he never touched a hair of Colonel Protheroes\nhead.",
    "But the telephone call I said.",
    "The letter \u2014 the overdose.",
    "Its\nall so clear.",
    "Thats what he wants you to think.",
    "Oh hes very clever Keeping\nthe letter and using it this way was very clever indeed.",
    "Who do you mean I said by he\n\nI mean the murderer said Miss Marple.",
    "She added very quietly\n\nI mean Mr. Lawrence Redding .",
    ". .\n\n\fChapter XXX\n\nWe stared at her.",
    "I really think that for a moment or two we really\nbelieved she was out of her mind.",
    "The accusation seemed so\nutterly preposterous.",
    "Colonel Melchett was the first to speak.",
    "He spoke kindly and with\na kind of pitying tolerance.",
    "That is absurd Miss Marple he said.",
    "Young Redding has been\ncompletely cleared.",
    "Naturally said Miss Marple.",
    "He saw to that.",
    "On the contrary said Colonel Melchett dryly.",
    "He did his best\nto get himself accused of the murder.",
    "Yes said Miss Marple.",
    "He took us all in that way \u2014 myself as\nmuch as any one else.",
    "You will remember dear Mr. Clement that\nI was quite taken aback when I heard Mr. Redding had\n\n\fconfessed to the crime.",
    "It upset all my ideas and made me think\nhim innocent \u2014 when up to then I had felt convinced that he was\nguilty.",
    "Then it was Lawrence Redding you suspected\n\nI know that in books it is always the most unlikely person.",
    "But I\nnever find that rule applies in real life.",
    "There it is so often the\nobvious that is true.",
    "Much as I have always liked Mrs. Protheroe\nI could not avoid coming to the conclusion that she was\ncompletely under Mr. Reddings thumb and would do anything he\ntold her and of course he is not the kind of young man who\nwould dream of running away with a penniless woman.",
    "From his\npoint of view it was necessary that Colonel Protheroe should be\nremoved \u2014 and so he removed him.",
    "One of those charming\nyoung men who have no moral sense.",
    "Colonel Melchett had been snorting impatiently for some time.",
    "Now he broke out.",
    "Absolute nonsense \u2014 the whole thing Reddings time is fully\naccounted for up to 6.50 and Haydock says positively Protheroe\ncouldnt have been shot then.",
    "I suppose you think you know\nbetter than a doctor.",
    "Or do you suggest that Haydock is\ndeliberately lying \u2014 the Lord knows why\n\nI think Dr. Haydocks evidence was absolutely truthful.",
    "He is a\nvery upright man.",
    "And of course it was Mrs. Protheroe who\nactually shot Colonel Protheroe \u2014 not Mr. Redding.",
    "Again we stared at her.",
    "Miss Marple arranged her lace fichu\npushed back the fleecy shawl that draped her shoulders and\nbegan to deliver a gentle oldmaidish lecture comprising the\nmost astounding statements in the most natural way in the\nworld.",
    "I have not thought it right to speak until now.",
    "Ones own belief\n\u2014 even so strong as to amount to knowledge \u2014 is not the same\nas proof.",
    "And unless one has an explanation that will fit all the\nfacts as I was saying to dear Mr. Clement this evening one\ncannot advance it with any real conviction.",
    "And my own\n\n\fexplanation was not quite complete \u2014 it lacked just one thing \u2014\nbut suddenly just as I was leaving Mr. Clements study I noticed\nthe palm in the pot by the window \u2014 and \u2014 well there the whole\nthing was Clear as daylight\n\nMad \u2014 quite mad muttered Melchett to me.",
    "But Miss Marple beamed on us serenely and went on in her\ngentle ladylike voice.",
    "I was very sorry to believe what I did \u2014 very sorry.",
    "Because I\nliked them both.",
    "But you know what human nature is.",
    "And to\nbegin with when first he and then she both confessed in the\nmost foolish way \u2014 well I was more relieved than I could say.",
    "I\nhad been wrong.",
    "And I began to think of other people who had a\npossible motive for wishing Colonel Protheroe out of the way.",
    "The seven suspects I murmured.",
    "She smiled at me.",
    "Yes indeed.",
    "There was that man Archer \u2014 not likely but\nprimed with drink so inflaming you never know.",
    "And of course\nthere was your Mary.",
    "Shes been walking out with Archer a long\ntime and shes a queertempered girl.",
    "Motive and opportunity \u2014\nwhy she was alone in the house Old Mrs. Archer could easily\nhave got the pistol from Mr. Reddings house for either of those\ntwo.",
    "And then of course there was Lettice \u2014 wanting freedom\nand money to do as she liked.",
    "Ive known many cases where the\nmost beautiful and ethereal girls have shown next to no moral\nscruple \u2014 though of course gentlemen never wish to believe it\nof them.",
    "I winced.",
    "And then there was the tennis racquet continued Miss Marple.",
    "The tennis racquet\n\nYes the one Mrs. Price Ridleys Clara saw lying on the grass by\nthe Vicarage gate.",
    "That looked as though Mr. Dennis had got\nback earlier from his tennis party than he said.",
    "Boys of sixteen\n\n\fare so very susceptible and so very unbalanced.",
    "Whatever the\nmotive \u2014 for Lettices sake or for yours it was a possibility.",
    "And\nthen of course there was poor Mr. Hawes and you \u2014 not both of\nyou naturally \u2014 but alternatively as the lawyers say.",
    "Me I exclaimed in lively astonishment.",
    "Well yes.",
    "I do apologise \u2014 and indeed I never really thought \u2014\nbut there was the question of these disappearing sums of\nmoney.",
    "Either you or Mr. Hawes must be guilty and Mrs. Price\nRidley was going about everywhere hinting that you were the\nperson in fault \u2014 Principally because you objected so vigorously\nto any kind of inquiry into the matter.",
    "Of course I myself was\nalways convinced it was Mr. Hawes \u2014 he reminded me so much\nof that unfortunate organist I mentioned but all the same one\ncouldnt be absolutely sure \u2014\n\nHuman nature being what it is I ended grimly.",
    "Exactly.",
    "And then of course there was dear Griselda.",
    "But Mrs. Clement was completely out of it interrupted\nMelchett.",
    "She returned by the 6.50 train.",
    "Thats what she said retorted Miss Marple.",
    "One should never\ngo by what people say.",
    "The 6.50 was half an hour late that night.",
    "But at a quarterpast seven I saw her with my own eyes starting\nfor Old Hall.",
    "So it followed that she must have come by the\nearlier train.",
    "Indeed she was seen but perhaps you know that\n\nShe looked at me inquiringly.",
    "Some magnetism in her glance impelled me to hold out the last\nanonymous letter the one I had opened so short a time ago.",
    "It\nset out in detail that Griselda had been seen leaving Lawrence\nReddings cottage by the back window at twenty past six on the\nfatal day.",
    "I said nothing then or at any time of the dreadful suspicion that\nhad for one moment assailed my mind.",
    "I had seen it in nightmare\nterms \u2014 a past intrigue between Lawrence and Griselda the\nknowledge of it coming to Protheroes ears his decision to make\n\n\fme acquainted with the facts \u2014 and Griselda desperate\nstealing the pistol and silencing Protheroe.",
    "As I say \u2014 a\nnightmare only \u2014 but invested for a few long minutes with a\ndreadful appearance of reality.",
    "I dont know whether Miss Marple had any inkling of all this.",
    "Very\nprobably she had.",
    "Few things are hidden from her.",
    "She handed me back the note with a little nod.",
    "Thats been all over the village she said.",
    "And it did look\nrather suspicious didnt it Especially with Mrs. Archer\nswearing at the inquest that the pistol was still in the cottage\nwhen she left at midday.",
    "She paused a minute and then went on.",
    "But Im wandering terribly from the point.",
    "What I want to say \u2014\nand I believe it my duty \u2014 is to put my own explanation of the\nmystery before you.",
    "If you dont believe it \u2014 well I shall have\n\n\fdone my best.",
    "Even as it is my wish to be quite sure before I\nspoke may have cost poor Mr. Hawes his life.",
    "Again she paused and when she resumed her voice held a\ndifferent note.",
    "It was less apologetic more decided.",
    "That is my own explanation of the facts.",
    "By Thursday afternoon\nthe crime had been fully planned down to the smallest detail.",
    "Lawrence Redding first called on the vicar knowing him to be\nout.",
    "He had with him the pistol which he concealed in that pot in\nthe stand by the window.",
    "When the vicar came in Lawrence\nexplained his visit by a statement that he had made up his mind\nto go away.",
    "At fivethirty Lawrence Redding telephoned from\nthe North Lodge to the vicar adopting a womans voice you\nremember what a good amateur actor he was.",
    "Mrs. Protheroe and her husband had just started for the village.",
    "And \u2014 a very curious thing though no one happened to think of\nit that way \u2014 Mrs. Protheroe took no handbag with her.",
    "Really a\nmost unusual thing for a woman to do.",
    "Just before twenty past\nsix she passes my garden and stops and speaks so as to give\n\n\fme every opportunity of noticing that she has no weapon with\nher and also that she is quite her normal self.",
    "They realised you\nsee that I am a noticing kind of person.",
    "She disappears round\nthe corner of the house to the study window.",
    "The poor colonel is\nsitting at the desk writing his letter to you.",
    "He is deaf as we all\nknow.",
    "She takes the pistol from the bowl where it is waiting for\nher comes up behind him and shoots him through the head\nthrows down the pistol and is out again like a flash and going\ndown the garden to the studio.",
    "Nearly any one would swear that\nthere couldnt have been time\n\nBut the shot objected the colonel.",
    "You didnt hear the shot\n\nThere is I believe an invention called a Maxim silencer.",
    "So I\ngather from detective stories.",
    "I wonder if possibly the sneeze\nthat the maid Clara heard might have actually been the shot\nBut no matter.",
    "Mrs. Protheroe is met at the studio by Mr.\nRedding.",
    "They go in together \u2014 and human nature being what it\nis Im afraid they realise that I shant leave the garden till they\ncome out again\n\n\fI had never liked Miss Marple better than at this moment with\nher humorous perception of her own weakness.",
    "When they do come out their demeanour is gay and natural.",
    "And there in reality they made a mistake.",
    "Because if they had\nreally said goodbye to each other as they pretended they\nwould have looked very different.",
    "But you see that was their\nweak point.",
    "They simply dare not appear upset in any way.",
    "For\nthe next ten minutes they are careful to provide themselves with\nwhat is called an alibi I believe.",
    "Finally Mr. Redding goes to the\nVicarage leaving it as late as he dares.",
    "He probably saw you on\nthe footpath from far away and was able to time matters nicely.",
    "He picks up the pistol and the silencer leaves the forged letter\nwith the time on it written in a different ink and apparently in a\ndifferent handwriting.",
    "When the forgery is discovered it will look\nlike a clumsy attempt to incriminate Anne Protheroe.",
    "But when he leaves the letter he finds the one actually written\nby Colonel Protheroe \u2014 something quite unexpected.",
    "And being\na very intelligent young man and seeing that this letter may\ncome in very useful to him he takes it away with him.",
    "He alters\n\n\fthe hands of the clock to the same time as the letter \u2014 knowing\nthat it is always kept a quarter of an hour fast.",
    "The same idea \u2014\nattempt to throw suspicion on Mrs. Protheroe.",
    "Then he leaves\nmeeting you outside the gate and acting the part of someone\nnearly distraught.",
    "As I say he is really most intelligent.",
    "What\nwould a murderer who had committed a crime try to do Behave\nnaturally of course.",
    "So that is just what Mr. Redding does not\ndo.",
    "He gets rid of the silencer but marches into the police\nstation with the pistol and makes a perfectly ridiculous\nselfaccusation which takes everybody in.",
    "There was something fascinating in Miss Marples resum\u00e9 of the\ncase.",
    "She spoke with such certainty that we both felt that this\nway and in no other could the crime have been committed.",
    "What about the shot heard in the wood I asked.",
    "Was that the\ncoincidence to which you were referring earlier this evening\n\nOh dear no.",
    "Miss Marple shook her head briskly.",
    "That wasnt\na coincidence \u2014 very far from it.",
    "It was absolutely necessary\nthat a shot should be heard \u2014 otherwise suspicion of Mrs.\n\n\fProtheroe might have continued.",
    "How Mr. Redding arranged it I\ndont quite know.",
    "But I understand that picric acid explodes if\nyou drop a weight on it and you will remember dear vicar that\nyou met Mr. Redding carrying a large stone just in the part of the\nwood where you picked up that crystal later.",
    "Gentlemen are so\nclever at arranging things \u2014 the stone suspended above the\ncrystals and then a time fuse \u2014 or do I mean a slow match\nSomething that would take about twenty minutes to burn through\n\u2014 so that the explosion would come about 6.30 when he and\nMrs. Protheroe had come out of the studio and were in full view.",
    "A very safe device because what would there be to find\nafterwards \u2014 only a big stone But even that he tried to remove\n\u2014 when you came upon him.",
    "I believe you are right I exclaimed remembering the start of\nsurprise Lawrence had given on seeing me that day.",
    "It had\nseemed natural enough at the time but now .",
    ". .\n\nMiss Marple seemed to read my thoughts for she nodded her\nhead shrewdly.",
    "Yes she said it must have been a very nasty shock for him to\ncome across you just then.",
    "But he turned it off very well \u2014\npretending he was bringing it to me for my rock gardens.",
    "Only \u2014\n Miss Marple became suddenly very emphatic.",
    "It was the\nwrong sort of stone for my rock gardens And that put me on the\nright track\n\nAll this time Colonel Melchett had sat like a man in a trance.",
    "Now\nhe showed signs of coming to.",
    "He snorted once or twice blew\nhis nose in a bewildered fashion and said\n\nUpon my word Well upon my word\n\nBeyond that he did not commit himself.",
    "I think that he like\nmyself was impressed with the logical certainty of Miss Marples\nconclusions.",
    "But for the moment he was not willing to admit it.",
    "Instead he stretched out a hand picked up the crumpled letter\nand barked out\n\n\fAll very well.",
    "But how do you account for this fellow Hawes\nWhy he actually rang up and confessed.",
    "Yes that was what was so providential.",
    "The vicars sermon\ndoubtless.",
    "You know dear Mr. Clement you really preached a\nmost remarkable sermon.",
    "It must have affected Mr. Hawes\ndeeply.",
    "He could bear it no longer and felt he must confess\nabout the misappropriations of the church funds.",
    "What\n\nYes \u2014 and that under Providence is what has saved his life.",
    "For I hope and trust it is saved.",
    "Dr. Haydock is so clever.",
    "As I\nsee the matter Mr. Redding kept this letter a risky thing to do\nbut I expect he hid it in some safe place and waited till he found\nout for certain to whom it referred.",
    "He soon made quite sure that\nit was Mr. Hawes.",
    "I understand he came back here with Mr.\nHawes last night and spent a long time with him.",
    "I suspect that\nhe then substituted a cachet of his own for one of Mr. Hawes\nand slipped this letter in the pocket of Mr. Hawess dressinggown.",
    "The poor young man would swallow the fatal cachet in all\n\n\finnocence \u2014 after his death his things would be gone through\nand the letter found and every one would jump to the conclusion\nthat he had shot Colonel Protheroe and taken his own life out of\nremorse.",
    "I rather fancy Mr. Hawes must have found that letter\ntonight just after taking the fatal cachet.",
    "In his disordered state\nit must have seemed like something supernatural and coming\non top of the vicars sermon it must have impeded him to\nconfess the whole thing.",
    "Upon my word said Colonel Melchett.",
    "Upon my word Most\nextraordinary I \u2014 I \u2014 dont believe a word of it.",
    "He\n\nhad\n\nnever\n\nmade\n\na\n\nstatement\n\nthat\n\nsounded\n\nmore\n\nunconvincing.",
    "It must have sounded so in his own ears for he\nwent on\n\nAnd can you explain the other telephone call \u2014 the one from Mr.\nReddings cottage to Mrs. Price Ridley\n\nAh said Miss Marple.",
    "That is what I call the coincidence.",
    "Dear\nGriselda sent that call \u2014 she and Mr. Dennis between them I\n\n\ffancy.",
    "They had heard the rumours Mrs. Price Ridley was\ncirculating about the vicar and they thought of this perhaps\nrather childish way of silencing her.",
    "The coincidence lies in the\nfact that the call should have been put through at exactly the\nsame time as the fake shot from the wood.",
    "It led one to believe\nthat the two must be connected.",
    "I suddenly remembered how every one who spoke of that shot\nhad described it as different from the usual shot.",
    "They had\nbeen right.",
    "Yet how hard to explain just in what way the\ndifference of the shot consisted.",
    "Colonel Melchett cleared his throat.",
    "Your solution is a very plausible one Miss Marple he said.",
    "But you will allow me to point out that there is not a shadow of\nproof.",
    "I know said Miss Marple.",
    "But you believe it to be true dont\nyou\n\n\fThere was a pause then the colonel said almost reluctantly\n\nYes I do.",
    "Dash it all its the only way the thing could have\nhappened.",
    "But theres no proof \u2014 not an atom.",
    "Miss Marple coughed.",
    "That is why I thought perhaps \u2014 under the circumstances \u2014\n\nYes\n\nA little trap might be permissible.",
    "Chapter XXXI\n\nColonel Melchett and I both stared at her.",
    "A trap What kind of a trap\n\nMiss Marple was a little diffident but it was clear that she had a\nplan fully outlined.",
    "Supposing Mr. Redding were to be rung up on the telephone\nand warned.",
    "Colonel Melchett smiled.",
    "All is discovered.",
    "Fly Thats an old wheeze Miss Marple.",
    "Not\nthat it isnt often successful But I think in this case young\nRedding is too downy a bird to be caught that way.",
    "It would have to be something specific.",
    "I quite realise that said\nMiss Marple.",
    "I would suggest \u2014 this is just a mere suggestion \u2014\n\n\fthat the warning should come from somebody who is known to\nhave rather unusual views on these matters.",
    "Dr. Haydocks\nconversation would lead any one to suppose that he might view\nsuch a thing as murder from an unusual angle.",
    "If he were to hint\nthat somebody \u2014 Mrs. Sadler \u2014 or one of her children \u2014 had\nactually happened to see the transposing of the cache \u2014 well of\ncourse if Mr. Redding is an innocent man that statement will\nmean nothing to him but if he isnt \u2014\n\nIf he isnt\n\nWell he might just possibly do something foolish.",
    "And deliver himself into our hands.",
    "Its possible.",
    "Very\ningenious Miss Marple.",
    "But will Haydock stand for it As you\nsay his views \u2014\n\nMiss Marple interrupted him brightly.",
    "Oh but thats theory So very different from practice isnt it\nBut anyway here he is so we can ask him.",
    "Haydock was I think rather astonished to find Miss Marple with\nus.",
    "He looked tired and haggard.",
    "Its been a near thing he said.",
    "A very near thing.",
    "But hes\ngoing to pull through.",
    "Its a doctors business to save his patient\nand I saved him but Id have been just as glad if I hadnt pulled it\noff.",
    "You may think differently said Melchett when you have heard\nwhat we have to tell you.",
    "And briefly and succinctly he put Miss Marples theory of the\ncrime before the doctor ending up with her final suggestion.",
    "We were then privileged to see exactly what Miss Marple meant\nby the difference between theory and practice.",
    "Haydocks views appeared to have undergone complete\ntransformation.",
    "He would I think have liked Lawrence\nReddings head on a charger.",
    "It was not I imagine the murder of\n\n\fColonel Protheroe that so stirred his rancour.",
    "It was the assault\non the unlucky Hawes.",
    "The\n\ndamned\n\nscoundrel\n\nsaid\n\nHaydock.",
    "The\n\ndamned\n\nscoundrel That poor devil Hawes.",
    "Hes got a mother and a sister\ntoo.",
    "The stigma of being the mother and sister of a murderer\nwould have rested on them for life and think of their mental\nanguish.",
    "Of all the cowardly dastardly tricks\n\nFor sheer primitive rage commend me to a thoroughgoing\nhumanitarian when you get him well roused.",
    "If this things true he said you can count on me.",
    "The fellows\nnot fit to live.",
    "A defenceless chap like Hawes.",
    "A lame dog of any kind can always count on Haydocks\nsympathy.",
    "He was eagerly arranging details with Melchett when Miss\nMarple rose and I insisted on seeing her home.",
    "It is most kind of you Mr. Clement said Miss Marple as we\nwalked down the deserted street.",
    "Dear me past twelve oclock.",
    "I hope Raymond has gone to bed and not waited up.",
    "He should have accompanied you I said.",
    "I didnt let him know I was going said Miss Marple.",
    "I smiled suddenly as I remembered Raymond Wests subtle\npsychological analysis of the crime.",
    "If your theory turns out to be the truth \u2014 which I for one do not\ndoubt for a minute I said you will have a very good score over\nyour nephew.",
    "Miss Marple smiled also \u2014 an indulgent smile.",
    "I remember a saying of my Great Aunt Fannys.",
    "I was sixteen at\nthe time and thought it particularly foolish.",
    "Yes I inquired.",
    "She used to say The young people think the old people are\nfools but the old people know the young people are fools\n\nChapter XXXII\n\nThere is little more to be told.",
    "Miss Marples plan succeeded.",
    "Lawrence Redding was not an innocent man and the hint of a\nwitness of the change of capsule did indeed cause him to do\nsomething foolish.",
    "Such is the power of an evil conscience.",
    "He was of course peculiarly placed.",
    "His first impulse I imagine\nmust have been to cut and run.",
    "But there was his accomplice to\nconsider.",
    "He could not leave without getting word to her and he\ndared not wait till morning.",
    "So he went up to Old Hall that night\n\n\f\u2014 and two of Colonel Melchetts most efficient officers followed\nhim.",
    "He threw gravel at Anne Protheroes window aroused her\nand an urgent whisper brought her down to speak with him.",
    "Doubtless they felt safer outside than in \u2014 with the possibility of\nLettice waking.",
    "But as it happened the two police officers were\nable to overhear their conversation in full.",
    "It left the matter in no\ndoubt.",
    "Miss Marple had been right on every count.",
    "The trial of Lawrence Redding and Anne Protheroe is a matter of\npublic knowledge.",
    "I do not propose to go into it.",
    "I will only\nmention that great credit was reflected upon Inspector Slack\nwhose zeal and intelligence had resulted in the criminals being\nbrought to justice.",
    "Naturally nothing was said of Miss Marples\nshare in the business.",
    "She herself would have been horrified at\nthe thought of such a thing.",
    "Lettice came to see me just before the trial took place.",
    "She\ndrifted through my study window wraithlike as ever.",
    "She told\nme then that she had all along been convinced of her\nstepmothers complicity.",
    "The loss of the yellow beret had been a\n\n\fmere excuse for searching the study.",
    "She hoped against hope\nthat she might find something the police had overlooked.",
    "You see she said in her dreamy voice they didnt hate her\nlike I did.",
    "And hate makes things easier for you.",
    "Disappointed in the result of her search she had deliberately\ndropped Annes earring by the desk.",
    "Since I knew she had done it what did it matter One way was\nas good as another.",
    "She had killed him.",
    "I sighed a little.",
    "There are always some things that Lettice will\nnever see.",
    "In some respects she is morally colour blind.",
    "What are you going to do Lettice I asked.",
    "When \u2014 when its all over I am going abroad.",
    "She hesitated\nand then went on.",
    "I am going abroad with my mother.",
    "I looked up startled.",
    "She nodded.",
    "Didnt you ever guess Mrs. Lestrange is my mother.",
    "She is \u2014 is\ndying you know.",
    "She wanted to see me and so she came down\nhere under an assumed name.",
    "Dr. Haydock helped her.",
    "Hes a\nvery old friend of hers \u2014 he was keen about her once \u2014 you can\nsee that In a way he still is.",
    "Men always went batty about\nmother I believe.",
    "Shes awfully attractive even now.",
    "Anyway Dr.\nHaydock did everything he could to help her.",
    "She didnt come\ndown here under her own name because of the disgusting way\npeople talk and gossip.",
    "She went to see father that night and told\nhim she was dying and had a great longing to see something of\nme.",
    "Father was a beast.",
    "He said shed forfeited all claim and\nthat I thought she was dead \u2014 as though I had ever swallowed\nthat story Men like father never see an inch before their noses\n\nBut mother is not the sort to give in.",
    "She thought it only decent\nto go to father first but when he turned her down so brutally she\nsent a note to me and I arranged to leave the tennis party early\nand meet her at the end of the footpath at a quarter past six.",
    "We\n\n\fjust had a hurried meeting and arranged when to meet again.",
    "We\nleft each other before halfpast six.",
    "Afterwards I was terrified\nthat she would be suspected of having killed father.",
    "After all she\nhad got a grudge against him.",
    "Thats why I got hold of that old\npicture of her up in the attic and slashed it about.",
    "I was afraid the\npolice might go nosing about and get hold of it and recognise it.",
    "Dr. Haydock was frightened too.",
    "Sometimes I believe he really\nthought she had done it Mother is rather a \u2014 desperate kind of\nperson.",
    "She doesnt count consequences.",
    "She paused.",
    "Its queer.",
    "She and I belong to each other.",
    "Father and I didnt.",
    "But mother \u2014 well anyway Im going abroad with her.",
    "I shall be\nwith her till \u2014 till the end .",
    ". .\n\nShe got up and I took her hand.",
    "God bless you both I said.",
    "Some day I hope there is a lot of\nhappiness coming to you Lettice.",
    "There should be she said with an attempt at a laugh.",
    "There hasnt been much so far \u2014 has there Oh well I dont\nsuppose it matters.",
    "Goodbye Mr. Clement.",
    "Youve been\nfrightfully decent to me always \u2014 you and Griselda.",
    "Griselda\n\nI had to own to her how terribly the anonymous letter had upset\nme and first she laughed and then solemnly read me a lecture.",
    "However she added Im going to be very sober and\nGodfearing in future \u2014 quite like the Pilgrim fathers.",
    "I did not see Griselda in the r\u00f4le of a Pilgrim father.",
    "She went on\n\nYou see Len I have a steadying influence coming into my life.",
    "Its coming into your life too but in your case it will be a kind of\n\u2014 of rejuvenating one \u2014 at least I hope so You cant call me a\n\n\fdear child half so much when we have a real child of our own.",
    "And Len Ive decided that now Im going to be a real wife and\nmother as they say in books I must be a housekeeper too.",
    "Ive\nbought two books on Household Management and one on Mother\nLove and if that doesnt turn me out a pattern I dont know what\nwill They are all simply screamingly funny \u2014 not intentionally\nyou know.",
    "Especially the one about bringing up children.",
    "You havent bought a book on How to Treat a Husband have\nyou I asked with sudden apprehension as I drew her to me.",
    "I dont need to said Griselda.",
    "Im a very good wife.",
    "I love you\ndearly.",
    "What more do you want\n\nNothing I said.",
    "Could you say just for once that you love me madly\n\nGriselda I said \u2014 I adore you I worship you I am wildly\nhopelessly and quite unclerically crazy about you\n\n\fMy wife gave a deep and contented sigh.",
    "Then she drew away suddenly.",
    "Bother Heres Miss Marple coming.",
    "Dont let her suspect will\nyou I dont want every one offering me cushions and urging me\nto put my feet up.",
    "Tell her Ive gone down to the golf links.",
    "That\nwill put her off the scent \u2014 and its quite true because I left my\nyellow pullover there and I want it.",
    "Miss Marple came to the window halted apologetically and\nasked for Griselda.",
    "Griselda I said has gone to the golf links.",
    "An expression of concern leaped into Miss Marples eyes.",
    "Oh but surely she said that is most unwise \u2014 just now.",
    "And then in a nice oldfashioned ladylike maidenlady way\nshe blushed.",
    "And to cover the moments confusion we talked hurriedly of the\nProtheroe case and of Dr. Stone who had turned out to be a\nwellknown cracksman with several different aliases.",
    "Miss Cram\nby the way had been cleared of all complicity.",
    "She had at last\nadmitted taking the suitcase to the wood but had done so in all\ngood faith Dr. Stone having told her that he feared the rivalry of\nother arch\u00e6ologists who would not stick at burglary to gain their\nobject of discrediting his theories.",
    "The girl apparently swallowed\nthis not very plausible story.",
    "She is now according to the village\nlooking out for a more genuine article in the line of an elderly\nbachelor requiring a secretary.",
    "As we talked I wondered very much how Miss Marple had\ndiscovered our latest secret.",
    "But presently in a discreet fashion\nMiss Marple herself supplied me with a clue.",
    "I hope dear Griselda is not overdoing it she murmured and\nafter a discreet pause I was in the bookshop in Much Benham\nyesterday \u2014\n\n\fPoor Griselda \u2014 that book on Mother Love has been her\nundoing\n\nI wonder Miss Marple I said suddenly if you were to commit\na murder whether you would ever be found out.",
    "What a terrible idea said Miss Marple shocked.",
    "I hope I could\nnever do such a wicked thing.",
    "But human nature being what it is I murmured.",
    "Miss Marple acknowledged the hit with a pretty oldladyish\nlaugh.",
    "How naughty of you Mr. Clement.",
    "She rose.",
    "But naturally you\nare in good spirits.",
    "She paused by the window.",
    "My love to dear Griselda \u2014 and tell her \u2014 that any little secret is\nquite safe with me.",
    "Really Miss Marple is rather a dear . . ."
