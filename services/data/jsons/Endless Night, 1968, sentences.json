    "\fAgatha Christie\n\n\fEndless Night\n\n\fTo Nora Prichard\nfrom whom I first heard\nthe legend of Gipsy\u2019s Acre\n\n\fEvery Night and every Morn\nSome to Misery are born.",
    "Every Morn and every Night\nSome are born to Sweet Delight\nSome are born to Sweet Delight\nSome are born to Endless Night\nWilliam Blake\nAuguries of Innocence\n\n\f\n\fBOOK ONE\n\n\fOne\n\nIn my end is my beginning\u2026 That\u2019s a quotation I\u2019ve often heard people\nsay.",
    "It sounds all right\u2014but what does it really mean\nIs there ever any particular spot where one can put one\u2019s finger and\nsay \u201cIt all began that day at such a time and such a place with such an\nincident\u201d\nDid my story begin perhaps when I noticed the Sale Bill hanging on\nthe wall of the George and Dragon announcing Sale by Auction of that\nvaluable property \u201cThe Towers\u201d and giving particulars of the acreage\nthe miles and furlongs and the highly idealized portrait of \u201cThe Towers\u201d\nas it might have been perhaps in its prime anything from eighty to a\nhundred years ago\nI was doing nothing particular just strolling along the main street of\nKingston Bishop a place of no importance whatever killing time.",
    "I\nnoticed the Sale Bill.",
    "Why Fate up to its dirty work Or dealing out its\ngolden handshake of good fortune You can look at it either way.",
    "Or you could say perhaps that it all had its beginnings when I met\nSantonix during the talks I had with him I can close my eyes and see\nhis flushed cheeks the overbrilliant eyes and the movement of the\nstrong yet delicate hand that sketched and drew plans and elevations of\nhouses.",
    "One house in particular a beautiful house a house that would be\nwonderful to own\nMy longing for a house a fine and beautiful house such a house as I\ncould never hope to have flowered into life then.",
    "It was a happy fantasy\nshared between us the house that Santonix would build for me\u2014if he\nlasted long enough\u2026.",
    "A house that in my dreams I would live in with the girl that I loved a\nhouse in which just like a child\u2019s silly fairy story we should live together\n\n\f\u201chappy ever afterwards.\u201d All pure fantasy all nonsense but it started that\ntide of longing in me.",
    "Longing for something I was never likely to have.",
    "Or if this is a love story\u2014and it is a love story I swear\u2014then why\nnot begin where I first caught sight of Ellie standing in the dark fir trees\nof Gipsy\u2019s Acre\nGipsy\u2019s Acre.",
    "Yes perhaps I\u2019d better begin there at the moment\nwhen I turned away from the Sale board with a little shiver because a\nblack cloud had come over the sun and asked a question carelessly\nenough of one of the locals who was clipping a hedge in a desultory\nfashion nearby.",
    "\u201cWhat\u2019s this house The Towers like\u201d\nI can still see the queer face of the old man as he looked at me\nsideways and said\n\u201cThat\u2019s not what us calls it here.",
    "What sort of a name is that\u201d He\nsnorted disapproval.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s many a year now since folks lived in it and\ncalled it The Towers.\u201d He snorted again.",
    "I asked him then what he called it and again his eyes shifted away\nfrom me in his old wrinkled face in that queer way country folk have of\nnot speaking to you direct looking over your shoulder or round the\ncorner as it were as though they saw something you didn\u2019t and he said\n\u201cIt\u2019s called hereabouts Gipsy\u2019s Acre.\u201d\n\u201cWhy is it called that\u201d I asked.",
    "\u201cSome sort of a tale.",
    "I dunno rightly.",
    "One says one thing one says\nanother.\u201d And then he went on \u201cAnyway it\u2019s where the accidents take\nplace.\u201d\n\u201cCar accidents\u201d\n\u201cAll kinds of accidents.",
    "Car accidents mainly nowadays.",
    "It\u2019s a nasty\ncorner there you see.\u201d\n\u201cWell\u201d I said \u201cif it\u2019s a nasty curve I can well see there might be\naccidents.\u201d\n\u201cRural Council put up a Danger sign but it don\u2019t do no good that\ndon\u2019t.",
    "There are accidents just the same.\u201d\n\u201cWhy Gipsy\u201d I asked him.",
    "Again his eyes slipped past me and his answer was vague.",
    "\u201cSome tale or other.",
    "It was gipsies\u201d land once they say and they\nwere turned off and they put a curse on it.\u201d\nI laughed.",
    "\u201cAye\u201d he said \u201cyou can laugh but there\u2019s places as is cursed.",
    "You\nsmartAlecks in town don\u2019t know about them.",
    "But there\u2019s places as is\ncursed all right and there\u2019s a curse on this place.",
    "People got killed here\n\n\fin the quarry when they got the stone out to build.",
    "Old Geordie he fell\nover the edge there one night and broke his neck.\u201d\n\u201cDrunk\u201d I suggested.",
    "\u201cHe may have been.",
    "He liked his drop he did.",
    "But there\u2019s many\ndrunks as fall\u2014nasty falls\u2014but it don\u2019t do them no lasting harm.",
    "But\nGeordie he got his neck broke.",
    "In there\u201d he pointed up behind him to\nthe pinecovered hill \u201cin Gipsy\u2019s Acre.\u201d\nYes I suppose that\u2019s how it began.",
    "Not that I paid much attention to\nit at the time.",
    "I just happened to remember it.",
    "That\u2019s all.",
    "I think\u2014that is\nwhen I think properly\u2014that I built it up a bit in my mind.",
    "I don\u2019t know if\nit was before or later that I asked if there were still gipsies about there.",
    "He said there weren\u2019t many anywhere nowadays.",
    "The police were\nalways moving them on he said.",
    "I asked\n\u201cWhy doesn\u2019t anybody like gipsies\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re a thieving lot\u201d he said disapprovingly.",
    "Then he peered\nmore closely at me.",
    "\u201cHappen you\u2019ve got gipsy blood yourself\u201d he\nsuggested looking hard at me.",
    "I said not that I knew of.",
    "It\u2019s true I do look a bit like a gipsy.",
    "Perhaps\nthat\u2019s what fascinated me about the name of Gipsy\u2019s Acre.",
    "I thought to\nmyself as I was standing there smiling back at him amused by our\nconversation that perhaps I had a bit of gipsy blood.",
    "Gipsy\u2019s Acre.",
    "I went up the winding road that led out of the village\nand wound up through the dark trees and came at last to the top of the\nhill so that I could see out to sea and the ships.",
    "It was a marvellous view\nand I thought just as one does think things I wonder how it would be if\nGipsy\u2019s Acre was my acre\u2026Just like that\u2026It was only a ridiculous\nthought.",
    "When I passed my hedge clipper again he said\n\u201cIf you want gipsies there\u2019s old Mrs. Lee of course.",
    "The Major he\ngives her a cottage to live in.\u201d\n\u201cWho\u2019s the Major\u201d I asked.",
    "He said in a shocked voice \u201cMajor Phillpot of course.\u201d He seemed\nquite upset that I should ask I gathered that Major Phillpot was God\nlocally.",
    "Mrs. Lee was some kind of dependent of his I suppose whom\nhe provided for.",
    "The Phillpots seemed to have lived there all their lives\nand more or less to have run the place.",
    "As I wished my old boy good day and turned away he said\n\u201cShe\u2019s got the last cottage at the end of the street.",
    "You\u2019ll see her\noutside maybe.",
    "Doesn\u2019t like the inside of houses.",
    "Them as has got gipsy\nblood don\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\fSo there I was wandering down the road whistling and thinking\nabout Gipsy\u2019s Acre.",
    "I\u2019d almost forgotten what I\u2019d been told when I saw a\ntall blackhaired old woman staring at me over a garden hedge.",
    "I knew at\nonce it must be Mrs. Lee.",
    "I stopped and spoke to her.",
    "\u201cI hear you can tell me about Gipsy\u2019s Acre up there\u201d I said.",
    "She stared at me through a tangled fringe of black hair and she said\n\u201cDon\u2019t have nought to do with it young man.",
    "You listen to me.",
    "Forget about it.",
    "You\u2019re a goodlooking lad.",
    "Nothing good comes out of\nGipsy\u2019s Acre and never will.\u201d\n\u201cI see it\u2019s up for sale\u201d I said.",
    "\u201cAye that\u2019s so and more fool he who buys it.\u201d\n\u201cWho\u2019s likely to buy it\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s a builder after it.",
    "More than one.",
    "It\u2019ll go cheap.",
    "You\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\u201cWhy should it go cheap\u201d I asked curiously.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s a fine site.\u201d\nShe wouldn\u2019t answer that.",
    "\u201cSupposing a builder buys it cheap what will he do with it\u201d\nShe chuckled to herself.",
    "It was malicious unpleasant laughter.",
    "\u201cPull down the old ruined house and build of course.",
    "Twenty\u2014thirty\nhouses maybe\u2014and all with a curse on them.\u201d\nI ignored the last part of the sentence.",
    "I said speaking before I could\nstop myself\n\u201cThat would be a shame.",
    "A great shame.\u201d\n\u201cAh you needn\u2019t worry.",
    "They\u2019ll get no joy of it not those who buys\nand not those who lays the bricks and mortar.",
    "There\u2019ll be a foot that slips\non the ladder and there\u2019ll be the lorry that crashes with a load and the\nslate that falls from the roof of a house and finds its mark.",
    "And the trees\ntoo.",
    "Crashing maybe in a sudden gale.",
    "Ah you\u2019ll see There\u2019s none\nthat\u2019ll get any good out of Gipsy\u2019s Acre.",
    "They\u2019d do best to leave it alone.",
    "You\u2019ll see.",
    "You\u2019ll see.\u201d She nodded vigorously and then she repeated\nsoftly to herself \u201cThere\u2019s no luck for them as meddles with Gipsy\u2019s Acre.",
    "There never has been.\u201d\nI laughed.",
    "She spoke sharply.",
    "\u201cDon\u2019t laugh young man.",
    "It comes to me as maybe one of these days\nyou\u2019ll laugh on the wrong side of your mouth.",
    "There\u2019s never been no\nluck there not in the house nor yet in the land.\u201d\n\u201cWhat happened in the house\u201d I asked.",
    "\u201cWhy has it been empty so\nlong Why was it left to fall down\u201d\n\u201cThe last people that lived there died all of them.\u201d\n\u201cHow did they die\u201d I asked out of curiosity.",
    "\u201cBest not to speak of it again.",
    "But no one cared to come and live in it\nafterwards.",
    "It was left to moulder and decay.",
    "It\u2019s forgot by now and best\nthat it should be.\u201d\n\u201cBut you could tell me the story\u201d I said wheedlingly.",
    "\u201cYou know all\nabout it.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t gossip about Gipsy\u2019s Acre.\u201d Then she let her voice drop to a\nkind of phoney beggar\u2019s whine.",
    "\u201cI\u2019ll tell your fortune now my pretty lad\nif you like.",
    "Cross my palm with silver and I\u2019ll tell your fortune.",

    "Not to spare anyway.\u201d\nShe came nearer to me and went on in a wheedling voice.",
    "\u201cSixpence\nnow.",
    "Sixpence now.",
    "I\u2019ll do it for sixpence.",
    "What\u2019s that Nothing at all.",
    "I\u2019ll do it for sixpence because you\u2019re a handsome lad with a ready tongue\nand a way with you.",
    "It could be that you\u2019ll go far.\u201d\nI fished a sixpence out of my pocket not because I believed in any of\nher foolish superstitions but because for some reason I liked the old fraud\neven if I did see through her.",
    "She grabbed the coin from me and said\n\u201cGive me your hand then.",
    "Both hands.\u201d\nShe took my hands in her withered claw and stared down at the open\npalms.",
    "She was silent for a minute or two staring.",
    "Then she dropped my\nhands abruptly almost pushing them away from her.",
    "She retreated a step\nand spoke harshly.",
    "\u201cIf you know what\u2019s good for you you\u2019ll get out of Gipsy\u2019s Acre\nhere and now and you won\u2019t come back That\u2019s the best advice I can\ngive you.",
    "Don\u2019t come back.\u201d\n\u201cWhy not Why shouldn\u2019t I come back\u201d\n\u201cBecause if you do you\u2019ll come back to sorrow and loss and danger\nmaybe.",
    "There\u2019s trouble black trouble waiting for you.",
    "Forget you ever\nsaw this place.",
    "I\u2019m warning you.\u201d\n\u201cWell of all the\u2014\u201d\nBut she had turned away and was retreating to the cottage.",
    "She went\nin and slammed the door.",
    "I\u2019m not superstitious.",
    "I believe in luck of\ncourse who doesn\u2019t But not a lot of superstitious nonsense about ruined\nhouses with curses on them.",
    "And yet I had an uneasy feeling that the\nsinister old creature had seen something in my hands.",
    "I looked down at\nmy two palms spread out in front of me.",
    "What could anyone see in the\npalms of anyone\u2019s hands Fortunetelling was arrant nonsense\u2014just a\ntrick to get money out of you\u2014money out of your silly credulity.",
    "I\nlooked up at the sky.",
    "The sun had gone in the day seemed different now.",
    "A sort of shadow a kind of menace.",
    "Just an approaching storm I\nthought.",
    "The wind was beginning to blow the backs of the leaves were\nshowing on the trees.",
    "I whistled to keep my spirits up and walked along\nthe road through the village.",
    "I looked again at the pastedup bill advertising the auction of The\nTowers.",
    "I even made a note of the date.",
    "I had never attended a property\nsale in my life but I thought to myself that I\u2019d come and attend this one.",
    "It would be interesting to see who bought The Towers.",
    "That is to say\ninteresting to see who became the owner of Gipsy\u2019s Acre.",
    "Yes I think\nthat\u2019s really where it all began\u2026A fantastic notion occurred to me.",
    "I\u2019d\ncome and pretend to myself that I was the man who was going to bid for\nGipsy\u2019s Acre I\u2019d bid against the local builders They\u2019d drop out\ndisappointed in their hopes of buying it cheap.",
    "I\u2019d buy it and I\u2019d go to\nRudolf Santonix and say \u201cBuild me a house.",
    "I\u2019ve bought the site for\nyou.\u201d And I\u2019d find a girl a wonderful girl and we\u2019d live in it together\nhappy ever after.",
    "I often had dreams of that kind.",
    "Naturally they never came to\nanything but they were fun.",
    "That\u2019s what I thought then.",
    "Fun Fun my\nGod If I\u2019d only known\n\n\fTwo\n\nIt was pure chance that had brought me to the neighbourhood of Gipsy\u2019s\nAcre that day.",
    "I was driving a hired car taking some people down from\nLondon to attend a sale a sale not of a house but its contents.",
    "It was a\nbig house just at the outskirts of the town a particularly ugly one.",
    "I drove\nan elderly couple there who were interested from what I could overhear\nof their conversation in a collection of papier m\u00e2ch\u00e9 whatever papier\nm\u00e2ch\u00e9 was.",
    "The only time I ever heard it mentioned before was by my\nmother in connection with washingup bowls.",
    "She\u2019d said that a papier\nm\u00e2ch\u00e9 washingup bowl was far better than a plastic one any day It\nseemed an odd thing for rich people to want to come down and buy a\ncollection of the stuff.",
    "However I stored the fact away in my mind and I thought I would\nlook in a dictionary or read up somewhere what papier m\u00e2ch\u00e9 really\nwas.",
    "Something that people thought worthwhile to hire a car for and go\ndown to a country sale and bid for.",
    "I liked to know about things.",
    "I was\ntwentytwo years of age at that time and I had picked up a fair amount of\nknowledge one way and another.",

    "Good money to be made with tips.",
    "And not usually too strenuous.",
    "But\nthe work itself was boring.",
    "Once I\u2019d gone fruit picking in summer time.",

    "I want to find something.",
    "From the time I left school I wanted to find something but I didn\u2019t\nyet know what that something was going to be.",
    "It was just something I\nwas looking for in a vague unsatisfied sort of way.",
    "It was somewhere.",
    "Sooner or later I\u2019d know all about it.",
    "It might perhaps be a girl\u2026I like\ngirls but no girl I\u2019d met so far had been important\u2026You liked them all\nright but then you went to the next one quite gladly.",
    "They were like the\njobs I took.",
    "All right for a bit and then you got fed up with them and you\nwanted to move on to the next one.",
    "I\u2019d gone from one thing to another\never since I\u2019d left school.",
    "A lot of people disapproved of my way of life.",
    "I suppose they were\nwhat you might call my wellwishers.",
    "That was because they didn\u2019t\nunderstand the first thing about me.",
    "They wanted me to go steady with a\nnice girl save money get married to her and then settle down to a nice\nsteady job.",

    "Cissy if you know what I mean.",

    "I\ndecided then and there that Art wasn\u2019t for me.",
    "But the picture I was\n\n\flooking at now was somehow different.",
    "There were three pictures in the\nwindow.",
    "One a landscape nice bit of country for what I call everyday.",

    "A lot of space in it\nand a few great widening circles all round each other if you can put it\nthat way.",
    "All in different colours odd colours that you wouldn\u2019t expect.",
    "And here and there there were sketchy bits of colour that didn\u2019t seem to\nmean anything.",

    "They couldn\u2019t\neat me could they I went in feeling rather aggressive and on the\ndefensive.",
    "The inside of the place was all very hushed and grand.",

    "We couldn\u2019t bring things\ninto the open and say \u201cWhen shall we meet again Where can I find\nyou Where do you live\u201d Because you see if you ask the other person\nthat they\u2019d expect you to tell the same.",

    "I almost\nthought that she might have made it up But of course I knew that that\nwas impossible.",
    "I\u2019d given her my real name.",

    "It was\nawkward.",
    "It had become cold and we wanted to wander down from The\nTowers\u2014but what then Rather awkwardly I said tentatively\n\u201cAre you staying round here\u201d\nShe said she was staying in Market Chadwell.",
    "That was a market\ntown not very far away.",
    "It had I knew a large hotel threestarred.",

    "It\u2019s changed hands about four or five times since but nobody\nstays there long.\u201d\n\u201cAh\u201d said Mr. Lippincott appreciatively \u201cyes quite a piece of\nEnglish folklore.\u201d He looked at me curiously.",
    "\u201cAnd you and Ellie are not\nafraid of the curse\u201d He said it lightly with a slight smile.",
    "\u201cOf course not\u201d I said.",
    "\u201cNeither Ellie nor I would believe in any\nrubbish of that kind.",
    "Actually it\u2019s a lucky thing since because of it we got\nit cheap.\u201d When I said that a sudden thought struck me.",
    "It was lucky in\none sense but I thought that with all Ellie\u2019s money and her property and\nall the rest of it it couldn\u2019t matter to her very much whether she bought a\npiece of land cheap or at the top price.",
    "Then I thought no I was wrong.",
    "After all she\u2019d had a grandfather who came up from being a dock\nlabourer to a millionaire.",
    "Anyone of that kind would always wish to buy\ncheap and sell dear.",
    "\u201cWell I am not superstitious\u201d said Mr. Lippincott \u201cand the view\nfrom your property is quite magnificent.\u201d He hesitated.",
    "\u201cI only hope that\nwhen you come to move into your house to live there that Ellie will not\nhear too many of these stories that are going about.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll keep everything from her that I can\u201d I said.",
    "\u201cI don\u2019t suppose\nanybody will say anything to her.\u201d\n\u201cPeople in country villages are very fond of repeating stories of that\nkind\u201d said Mr. Lippincott.",
    "\u201cAnd Ellie remember is not as tough as you\nare Michael.",
    "She can be influenced easily.",
    "Only in some ways.",
    "Which\nbrings me\u2014\u201d he stopped without going on to say what he had been\ngoing to.",
    "He tapped on the table with one finger.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m going to speak to\n\n\fyou now on a matter of some difficulty.",
    "You said just now that you had\nnot met this Greta Andersen.\u201d\n\u201cNo as I said I haven\u2019t met her yet.\u201d\n\u201cOdd.",
    "Very curious.\u201d\n\u201cWell\u201d I looked at him inquiringly.",
    "\u201cI should have thought you\u2019d have been almost sure to have met\nher\u201d he said slowly.",
    "\u201cHow much do you know about her\u201d\n\u201cI know that she\u2019s been with Ellie some time.\u201d\n\u201cShe has been with Ellie since Ellie was seventeen.",
    "She has occupied\na post of some responsibility and trust.",
    "She came first to the States in the\ncapacity of secretary and companion.",
    "A kind of chaperone to Ellie when\nMrs. van Stuyvesant her stepmother was away from home which I may\nsay was a quite frequent occurrence.\u201d He spoke particularly dryly when\nhe said this.",
    "\u201cShe is I gather a wellborn girl with excellent references\nhalfSwedish halfGerman.",
    "Ellie became quite naturally very much\nattached to her.\u201d\n\u201cSo I gather\u201d I said.",
    "\u201cIn some way Ellie was I suppose almost too much attached to her.",
    "You don\u2019t mind my saying that\u201d\n\u201cNo.",
    "Why should I mind As a matter of fact I\u2019ve\u2014well I\u2019ve\nthought so myself once or twice.",
    "Greta this and Greta that.",
    "I got\u2014well I\nknow I\u2019ve no business to but I used to get fed up sometimes.\u201d\n\u201cAnd yet she expressed no wish for you to meet Greta\u201d\n\u201cWell\u201d I said \u201cit\u2019s rather difficult to explain.",
    "But I think yes I think\nshe probably did suggest it in a mild way once or twice but well we\nwere too taken up with having met each other.",
    "Besides oh well I\nsuppose I didn\u2019t really want to meet Greta.",
    "I didn\u2019t want to share Ellie\nwith anyone.\u201d\n\u201cI see.",
    "Yes I see.",
    "And Ellie did not suggest Greta being present at\nyour wedding\u201d\n\u201cShe did suggest it\u201d I said.",
    "\u201cBut\u2014but you didn\u2019t want her to come.",
    "Why\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.",
    "I really don\u2019t know.",
    "I just felt that this Greta this girl\nor woman I\u2019d never met she was always horning in on everything.",
    "You\nknow arranging Ellie\u2019s life for her.",
    "Sending postcards and letters and\nfilling in for Ellie arranging a whole itinerary and passing it on to the\nfamily.",
    "I felt that Ellie was dependent on Greta in a way that she let\nGreta run her that she wanted to do everything that Greta wanted.",
    "I\u2014oh\nI\u2019m sorry Mr. Lippincott I oughtn\u2019t to be saying all these things\nperhaps.",
    "Say I was just plain jealous.",
    "Anyway I blew up and I said I\n\n\fdidn\u2019t want Greta at the wedding that the wedding was ours that it was\njust our business and nobody else\u2019s.",
    "And so we went along to the\nRegistrar\u2019s office and his clerk and the typist from his office were the\ntwo witnesses.",
    "I dare say it was mean of me to refuse to have Greta\nthere but I wanted to have Ellie to myself.\u201d\n\u201cI see.",
    "Yes I see and I think if I may say so that you were wise\nMichael.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t like Greta either\u201d I said shrewdly.",
    "\u201cYou can hardly use the word \u2018either\u2019 Michael if you have not even\nmet her.\u201d\n\u201cNo I know but well I mean if you hear a lot about a person you\ncan form some sort of idea of them some judgment of them.",
    "Oh well\ncall it plain jealousy.",
    "Why don\u2019t you like Greta\u201d\n\u201cThis is without prejudice\u201d said Mr. Lippincott \u201cbut you are Ellie\u2019s\nhusband Michael and I have Ellie\u2019s happiness very much at heart.",
    "I\ndon\u2019t think that the influence that Greta has over Ellie is a very desirable\none.",
    "She takes too much upon herself.\u201d\n\u201cDo you think she\u2019ll try and make trouble between us\u201d I asked.",
    "\u201cI think\u201d said Mr. Lippincott \u201cthat I have no right to say anything of\nthat kind.\u201d\nHe sat looking cautiously at me and blinking like a wrinkled old\ntortoise.",
    "I didn\u2019t know quite what to say next.",
    "He spoke first choosing his\nwords with some care.",
    "\u201cThere has been then no suggestion that Greta Andersen might take\nup her residence with you\u201d\n\u201cNot if I can help it\u201d I said.",
    "\u201cAh.",
    "So that is what you feel The idea has been mooted.\u201d\n\u201cEllie did say something of the kind.",
    "But we\u2019re newly married Mr.\nLippincott.",
    "We want our house\u2014our new home\u2014to ourselves.",
    "Of course\nshe\u2019ll come and stay sometimes I suppose.",
    "That\u2019ll only be natural.\u201d\n\u201cAs you say that would be only natural.",
    "But you realize perhaps\nthat Greta is going to be in a somewhat difficult position as regards\nfurther employment.",
    "I mean it is not a question of what Ellie thinks of\nher but of what the people who engaged her and reposed trust in her\nfeel.\u201d\n\u201cYou mean that you or Mrs. van What\u2019shername won\u2019t recommend\nher for another post of the same kind\u201d\n\u201cThey are hardly likely to do so except so far as to satisfy purely\nlegal requirements.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cAnd you think that she\u2019ll want to come to England and live on\nEllie.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to prejudice you too much against her.",
    "After all this is\nmostly in my mind.",
    "I dislike some of the things she has done and the way\nshe has done them.",
    "I think that Ellie who has a very generous heart will\nbe upset at having shall we say blighted Greta\u2019s prospects in many\nways.",
    "She might impulsively insist on her coming to live with you.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think Ellie will insist\u201d I said slowly.",
    "I sounded a little\nworried all the same and I thought Lippincott noticed it.",
    "\u201cBut couldn\u2019t\nwe\u2014Ellie I mean\u2014couldn\u2019t Ellie pension her off\u201d\n\u201cWe should not put it precisely like that\u201d said Mr. Lippincott.",
    "\u201cThere\nis a suggestion of age about pensioning anyone off and Greta is a young\nwoman and I may say a very handsome young woman.",
    "Beautiful in\nfact\u201d he added in a deprecating disapproving voice.",
    "\u201cShe\u2019s very\nattractive to men too.\u201d\n\u201cWell perhaps she\u2019ll marry\u201d I said.",
    "\u201cIf she\u2019s all that why hasn\u2019t she\ngot married before this\u201d\n\u201cThere have been people attracted I believe but she has not\nconsidered them.",
    "I think however that your suggestion is a very sound\none.",
    "I think it might be carried out in a way that would not hurt anyone\u2019s\nsusceptibilities.",
    "It might seem quite a natural thing to do on Ellie\u2019s\nhaving attained her majority and having had her marriage helped on by\nGreta\u2019s good offices\u2014settle a sum of money upon her in a fit of\ngratitude.\u201d Mr. Lippincott made the last two words sound as sour as\nlemon juice.",
    "\u201cWell then that\u2019s all right\u201d I said cheerfully.",
    "\u201cAgain I see that you are an optimist.",
    "Let us hope that Greta will\naccept what is offered to her.\u201d\n\u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t she She\u2019d be mad if she didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d said Mr. Lippincott.",
    "\u201cI should say it would be\nextraordinary if she did not accept and they will remain on terms of\nfriendship of course.\u201d\n\u201cYou think\u2014what do you think\u201d\n\u201cI would like to see her influence over Ellie broken\u201d said Mr.\nLippincott.",
    "He got up.",
    "\u201cYou will I hope assist me and do everything you\ncan to further that end\u201d\n\u201cYou bet I will\u201d I said.",
    "\u201cThe last thing I want is to have Greta in our\npockets all the time.\u201d\n\u201cYou might change your mind when you see her\u201d said Mr.\nLippincott.",
    "\u201cI don\u2019t think so\u201d I said.",
    "\u201cI don\u2019t like managing females however\nefficient and even handsome they are.\u201d\n\u201cThank you Michael for listening to me so patiently.",
    "I hope you will\ngive me the pleasure of dining with me both of you.",
    "Possibly next\nTuesday evening Cora van Stuyvesant and Frank Barton will probably\nbe in London by that time.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I\u2019ve got to meet them I suppose\u201d\n\u201cOh yes that will be quite inevitable.\u201d He smiled at me and this time\nhis smile seemed more genuine than it had before.",
    "\u201cYou mustn\u2019t mind\ntoo much\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cCora I expect will be very rude to you.",
    "Frank will\nbe merely tactless.",
    "Reuben won\u2019t be over just at present.\u201d\nI didn\u2019t know who Reuben was\u2014another relation I supposed.",
    "I went across to the connecting doors and opened them.",
    "\u201cCome on\nEllie\u201d I said \u201cthe grilling is over.\u201d\nShe came back in the room and looked quickly from Lippincott to\nmyself then she went across and kissed him.",
    "\u201cDear Uncle Andrew\u201d she said.",
    "\u201cI can see you\u2019ve been nice to\nMichael.\u201d\n\u201cWell my dear if I weren\u2019t nice to your husband you wouldn\u2019t have\nmuch use for me in the future would you I do reserve the right to give a\nfew words of advice now and then.",
    "You\u2019re very young you know both of\nyou.\u201d\n\u201cAll right\u201d said Ellie \u201cwe\u2019ll listen patiently.\u201d\n\u201cNow my dear I\u2019d like to have a word with you if I may.\u201d\n\u201cMy turn to be odd man out\u201d I said and I too went into the bedroom.",
    "I shut the two double doors ostentatiously but I opened the inner one\nagain after I got inside.",
    "I hadn\u2019t been as well brought up as Ellie so I felt\na bit anxious to find out how doublefaced Mr. Lippincott might turn out\nto be.",
    "But actually there was nothing I need have listened to.",
    "He gave\nEllie one or two wise words of advice.",
    "He said she must realize that I\nmight find it difficult to be a poor man married to a rich wife and then he\nwent on to sound her about making a settlement on Greta.",
    "She agreed to\nit eagerly and said she\u2019d been going to ask him that herself.",
    "He also\nsuggested that she should make an additional settlement on Cora van\nStuyvesant.",
    "\u201cThere is no earthly need that you should do so\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cShe has\nbeen very well provided for in the matter of alimony from several\nhusbands.",
    "And she is as you know paid an income though not a very big\none from the trust fund left by your grandfather.\u201d\n\u201cBut you think I ought to give her more still\u201d\n\n\f\u201cI think there is no legal or moral obligation to do so.",
    "What I think is\nthat you will find her far less tiresome and shall I say catty if you do so.",
    "I\nshould make it in the form of an increased income which you could\nrevoke at any time.",
    "If you find that she has been spreading malicious\nrumours about Michael or yourself or your life together the knowledge\nthat you can do that will keep her tongue free of those more poisonous\nbarbs that she so well knows how to plant.\u201d\n\u201cCora has always hated me\u201d said Ellie.",
    "\u201cI\u2019ve known that.\u201d She\nadded rather shyly \u201cYou do like Mike don\u2019t you Uncle Andrew\u201d\n\u201cI think he\u2019s an extremely attractive young man\u201d said Mr.\nLippincott.",
    "\u201cAnd I can quite see how you came to marry him.\u201d\nThat I suppose was as good as I could expect.",
    "I wasn\u2019t really his\ntype and I knew it.",
    "I eased the door gently to and in a minute or two Ellie\ncame to fetch me.",
    "We were both standing saying goodbye to Lippincott when there\nwas a knock on the door and a page boy came in with a telegram.",
    "Ellie\ntook it and opened it.",
    "She gave a little surprised cry of pleasure.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s Greta\u201d she said \u201cshe\u2019s arriving in London tonight and she\u2019ll be\ncoming to see us tomorrow.",
    "How lovely.\u201d She looked at us both.",
    "\u201cIsn\u2019t\nit\u201d she said.",
    "She saw two sour faces and heard two polite voices saying one \u201cYes\nindeed my dear\u201d the other one \u201cOf course.\u201d\n\n\fEleven\n\nI had been out shopping the next morning and I arrived back at the hotel\nrather later than I had meant.",
    "I found Ellie sitting in the central lounge\nand opposite her was a tall blonde young woman.",
    "In fact Greta.",
    "Both of\nthem were talking nineteen to the dozen.",
    "I\u2019m never any hand at describing people but I\u2019ll have a shot at\ndescribing Greta.",
    "To begin with one couldn\u2019t deny that she was as Ellie\nhad said very beautiful and also as Mr. Lippincott had reluctantly\nadmitted very handsome.",
    "The two things are not exactly the same.",
    "If\nyou say a woman is handsome it does not mean that actually you\nyourself admire her.",
    "Mr. Lippincott I gathered had not admired Greta.",
    "All the same when Greta walked across the lounge into a hotel or in a\nrestaurant men\u2019s heads turned to look at her.",
    "She was a Nordic type of\nblonde with pure goldcorncoloured hair.",
    "She wore it piled high on her\nhead in the fashion of the time not falling straight down on each side of\nher face in the Chelsea tradition.",
    "She looked what she was Swedish or\nnorth German.",
    "In fact pin on a pair of wings and she could have gone to\na fancy dress ball as a Valkyrie.",
    "Her eyes were a bright clear blue and her\ncontours were admirable.",
    "Let\u2019s admit it.",
    "She was something\nI came along to where they were sitting and joined them greeting\nthem both in what I hope was a natural friendly manner though I\ncouldn\u2019t help feeling a bit awkward.",
    "I\u2019m not always very good at acting a\npart.",
    "Ellie said immediately\n\u201cAt last Mike this is Greta.\u201d\nI said I guessed it might be in a rather facetious not very happy\nmanner.",
    "I said\n\u201cI\u2019m very glad to meet you at last Greta.\u201d\nEllie said\n\n\f\u201cAs you know very well if it hadn\u2019t been for Greta we would never\nhave been able to get married.\u201d\n\u201cAll the same we\u2019d have managed it somehow\u201d I said.",
    "\u201cNot if the family had come down on us like a ton of coals.",
    "They\u2019d\nhave broken it up somehow.",
    "Tell me Greta have they been very awful\u201d\nEllie asked.",
    "\u201cYou haven\u2019t written or said anything to me about that.\u201d\n\u201cI know better\u201d said Greta \u201cthan to write to a happy couple when\nthey\u2019re on their honeymoon.\u201d\n\u201cBut were they very angry with you\u201d\n\u201cOf course What do you imagine But I was prepared for that I can\nassure you.\u201d\n\u201cWhat have they said or done\u201d\n\u201cEverything they could\u201d said Greta cheerfully.",
    "\u201cStarting with the\nsack naturally.\u201d\n\u201cYes I suppose that was inevitable.",
    "But\u2014but what have you done\nAfter all they can\u2019t refuse to give you references.\u201d\n\u201cOf course they can.",
    "And after all from their point of view I was\nplaced in a position of trust and abused it shamefully.\u201d She added\n\u201cEnjoyed abusing it too.\u201d\n\u201cBut what are you going to do now\u201d\n\u201cOh I\u2019ve got a job ready to walk into.\u201d\n\u201cIn New York\u201d\n\u201cNo.",
    "Here in London.",
    "Secretarial.\u201d\n\u201cBut are you all right\u201d\n\u201cDarling Ellie\u201d said Greta \u201chow can I not be all right with that\nlovely cheque you sent me in anticipation of what was going to happen\nwhen the balloon went up\u201d\nHer English was very good with hardly any trace of accent though\nshe used a lot of colloquial terms which sometimes didn\u2019t run quite right.",
    "\u201cI\u2019ve seen a bit of the world fixed myself up in London and bought a\ngood many things as well.\u201d\n\u201cMike and I have bought a lot of things too\u201d said Ellie smiling at\nthe recollection.",
    "It was true.",
    "We\u2019d done ourselves pretty well with our continental\nshopping.",
    "It was really wonderful that we had dollars to spend no\nniggling Treasury restrictions.",
    "Brocades and fabrics in Italy for the\nhouse.",
    "And we\u2019d bought pictures too both in Italy and in Paris paying\nwhat seemed fabulous sums for them.",
    "A whole world had opened up to\nme that I\u2019d never dreamt would have come my way.",
    "\u201cYou both look remarkably happy\u201d said Greta.",

    "A whack of money coming in and spending it\nas fast as I could on the biggest blowout I could find.",
    "Crude of course.",
    "The crudeness of my class.",
    "But Ellie\u2019s world was a different world.",
    "It\nwasn\u2019t what I should have thought it to be.",
    "Just more and more super\nluxury.",
    "It wasn\u2019t bigger bathrooms and larger houses and more electric\nlight fittings and bigger meals and faster cars.",
    "It wasn\u2019t just spending for\nspending\u2019s sake and showing off to everyone in sight.",
    "Instead it was\ncuriously simple.",
    "The sort of simplicity that comes when you get beyond\nthe point of splashing for splashing\u2019s sake.",
    "You don\u2019t want three yachts\nor four cars and you can\u2019t eat more than three meals a day and if you buy\na really topprice picture you don\u2019t want more than perhaps one of them\nin a room.",
    "It\u2019s as simple as that.",
    "Whatever you have is just the best of its\nkind not so much because it is the best but because there is no reason if\nyou like or want any particular thing why you shouldn\u2019t have it.",
    "There is\nno moment when you say \u201cI\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t afford that one.\u201d So in a\nstrange way it makes sometimes for such a curious simplicity that I\ncouldn\u2019t understand it.",
    "We were considering a French Impressionist\npicture a C\u00e9zanne I think it was.",
    "I had to learn that name carefully.",
    "I\nalways mixed it up with a tzigane which I gather is a gipsy orchestra.",
    "And then as we walked along the streets of Venice Ellie stopped to look\nat some pavement artists.",
    "On the whole they were doing some terrible\npictures for tourists which all looked the same.",
    "Portraits with great rows\nof shining teeth and usually blonde hair falling down their necks.",
    "And then she bought quite a tiny picture just a picture of a little\nglimpse through to a canal.",
    "The man who had painted it appraised the\nlook of us and she bought it for \u00a36 by English exchange.",
    "The funny thing\nwas that I knew quite well that Ellie had just the same longing for that \u00a36\npicture that she had for the C\u00e9zanne.",
    "It was the same way one day in Paris.",
    "She\u2019d said to me suddenly\n\u201cWhat fun it would be\u2014let\u2019s get a really nice crisp French loaf of\nbread and have that with butter and one of those cheeses wrapped up in\nleaves.\u201d\nSo we did and Ellie I think enjoyed it more than the meal we\u2019d had\nthe night before which had come to about \u00a320 English.",
    "At first I couldn\u2019t\nunderstand it then I began to see.",
    "The awkward thing was that I could\nsee now that being married to Ellie wasn\u2019t just fun and games.",
    "You have\nto do your homework you have to learn how to go into a restaurant and\nthe sort of things to order and the right tips and when for some reason\n\n\fyou gave more than usual.",
    "You have to memorize what you drink with\ncertain foods.",
    "I had to do most of it by observation.",
    "I couldn\u2019t ask Ellie\nbecause that was one of the things she wouldn\u2019t have understood.",
    "She\u2019d\nhave said \u201cBut darling Mike you can have anything you like.",
    "What does\nit matter if waiters think you ought to have one particular wine with one\nparticular thing\u201d It wouldn\u2019t have mattered to her because she was born\nto it but it mattered to me because I couldn\u2019t do just as I liked.",
    "I wasn\u2019t\nsimple enough.",
    "Clothes too.",
    "Ellie was more helpful there for she could\nunderstand better.",
    "She just guided me to the right places and told me to\nlet them have their head.",
    "Of course I didn\u2019t look right and sound right yet.",
    "But that didn\u2019t\nmatter much.",
    "I\u2019d got the hang of it enough so that I could pass muster\nwith people like old Lippincott and shortly presumably when Ellie\u2019s\nstepmother and uncles were around but actually it wasn\u2019t going to\nmatter in the future at all.",
    "When the house was finished and when we\u2019d\nmoved in we were going to be far away from everybody.",
    "It could be our\nkingdom.",
    "I looked at Greta sitting opposite me.",

    "Anyway it was what I wanted.",
    "It satisfied\nme utterly.",
    "I wanted to drive down and go through a private path through\nthe trees which led down to a small cove which would be our own beach\nwhich nobody could come to on the land side.",
    "It would be a thousand\ntimes better I thought plunging into the sea there.",
    "A thousand times\nbetter than a lido spread along a beach with hundreds of bodies lying\nthere.",

    "I wanted\u2014there were\nthe words again my own particular words\u2014I want I want\u2026I could feel\nall the feeling surging up in me.",
    "I wanted a wonderful woman and a\nwonderful house like nobody else\u2019s house and I wanted my wonderful\nhouse to be full of wonderful things.",
    "Things that belonged to me.",
    "Everything would belong to me.",
    "\u201cHe\u2019s thinking of our house\u201d said Ellie.",
    "It seemed that she had twice suggested to me that we should go now\ninto the dining room.",
    "I looked at her affectionately.",
    "Later in the day\u2014it was that evening\u2014when we were dressing to go\nout to dinner Ellie said a little tentatively\n\u201cMike you do\u2014you do like Greta don\u2019t you\u201d\n\u201cOf course I do\u201d I said.",

    "I think it\u2019s the way you hardly look at her even\nwhen you\u2019re talking to her.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cWell I suppose that\u2019s because\u2014well because I feel nervous.\u201d\n\u201cNervous of Greta\u201d\n\u201cYes she\u2019s a bit aweinspiring you know.\u201d\nAnd I told Ellie how I thought Greta looked rather like a Valkyrie.",
    "\u201cNot as stout as an operatic one\u201d said Ellie and laughed.",
    "We both\nlaughed.",
    "I said\n\u201cIt\u2019s all very well for you because you\u2019ve known her for years.",
    "But\nshe is just a bit\u2014well I mean she\u2019s very efficient and practical and\nsophisticated.\u201d I struggled with a lot of words which didn\u2019t seem to be\nquite the right ones.",
    "I said suddenly \u201cI feel\u2014I feel at a disadvantage\nwith her.\u201d\n\u201cOh Mike\u201d Ellie was consciencestricken.",
    "\u201cI know we\u2019ve got a lot\nof things to talk about.",
    "Old jokes and old things that happened and all\nthat.",
    "I suppose\u2014yes I suppose it might make you feel rather shy.",

    "She likes you.",
    "She likes you very much.",
    "She told me so.\u201d\n\u201cListen Ellie she\u2019d probably tell you that anyway.\u201d\n\u201cOh no she wouldn\u2019t.",
    "Greta\u2019s very outspoken.",
    "You heard her.",
    "Some\nof the things she said today.\u201d\nIt was true that Greta had not minced her words during luncheon.",
    "She\nhad said addressing me rather than Ellie\n\u201cYou must have thought it queer sometimes the way I was backing\nEllie up when I\u2019d not even seen you.",
    "But I got so mad\u2014so mad with the\nlife that they were making her lead.",
    "All tied up in a cocoon with their\nmoney their traditional ideas.",
    "She never had a chance to enjoy herself\ngo anywhere really by herself and do what she wanted.",
    "She wanted to\nrebel but she didn\u2019t know how.",
    "And so\u2014yes all right I urged her on.",
    "I\nsuggested she should look at properties in England.",
    "Then I said when she\nwas twentyone she could buy one of her own and say goodbye to all\nthat New York lot.\u201d\n\u201cGreta always has wonderful ideas\u201d said Ellie.",
    "\u201cShe thinks of things\nI\u2019d probably never have thought of myself.\u201d\nWhat were those words Mr. Lippincott had said to me \u201cShe has too\nmuch influence over Ellie.\u201d I wondered if it was true.",
    "Queerly enough I\ndidn\u2019t really think so.",

    "Ellie I was sure would always accept any ideas that matched with the\nideas she wanted to have herself.",
    "Greta had preached rebellion to Ellie\nbut Ellie herself wanted to rebel only she was not sure how to do so.",
    "But\nI felt that Ellie now that I was coming to know her better was one of\n\n\fthose very simple people who have unexpected reserves.",
    "I thought Ellie\nwould be quite capable of taking a stand of her own if she wished to.",
    "The\npoint was that she wouldn\u2019t very often wish to and I thought then how\ndifficult everyone was to understand.",
    "Even Ellie.",
    "Even Greta.",
    "Even\nperhaps my own mother\u2026The way she looked at me with fear in her\neyes.",
    "I wondered about Mr. Lippincott.",
    "I said as we were peeling some\noutsize peaches\n\u201cMr.",
    "Lippincott seems to have taken our marriage very well really.",
    "I\nwas surprised.\u201d\n\u201cMr.",
    "Lippincott\u201d said Greta \u201cis an old fox.\u201d\n\u201cYou always say so Greta\u201d said Ellie \u201cbut I think he\u2019s rather a dear.",
    "Very strict and proper and all that.\u201d\n\u201cWell go on thinking so if you like\u201d said Greta.",
    "\u201cMyself I wouldn\u2019t\ntrust him an inch.\u201d\n\u201cNot trust him\u201d said Ellie.",
    "Greta shook her head.",
    "\u201cI know.",
    "He\u2019s a pillar of respectability and\ntrustworthiness.",
    "He\u2019s everything a trustee and a lawyer should be.\u201d\nEllie laughed and said \u201cDo you mean he\u2019s embezzled my fortune\nDon\u2019t be silly Greta.",
    "There are thousands of auditors and banks and\ncheckups and all that sort of thing.\u201d\n\u201cOh I expect he\u2019s all right really\u201d said Greta.",
    "\u201cAll the same those\nare the people that do embezzle.",
    "The trustworthy ones.",
    "And then\neveryone says afterwards \u2018I\u2019d never have believed it of Mr. A. or Mr. B.",
    "The last man in the world.\u2019 Yes that\u2019s what they say.",
    "\u2018The last man in the\nworld.\u2019\u201d\nEllie said thoughtfully that her Uncle Frank she thought was much\nmore likely to go in for dishonest practices.",
    "She did not seem unduly\nworried or surprised by the idea.",
    "\u201cOh well he looks like a crook\u201d said Greta.",
    "\u201cThat handicaps him to\nstart with.",
    "All that geniality and bonhomie.",
    "But he\u2019ll never be in a\nposition to be a crook in a big way.\u201d\n\u201cIs he your mother\u2019s brother\u201d I asked.",
    "I always got confused over\nEllie\u2019s relations.",
    "\u201cHe\u2019s my father\u2019s sister\u2019s husband\u201d said Ellie.",
    "\u201cShe left him and\nmarried someone else and died about six or seven years ago.",
    "Uncle\nFrank has more or less stuck on with the family.\u201d\n\u201cThere are three of them\u201d said Greta kindly and helpfully.",
    "\u201cThree\nleeches hanging round as you might say.",
    "Ellie\u2019s actual uncles were\nkilled one in Korea and one in a car accident so what she\u2019s got is a\n\n\fmuchdamaged stepmother an Uncle Frank an amiable hangeron in the\nfamily home and her cousin Reuben whom she calls Uncle but he\u2019s only\na cousin and Andrew Lippincott and Stanford Lloyd.\u201d\n\u201cWho is Stanford Lloyd\u201d I asked bewildered.",
    "\u201cOh another sort of trustee isn\u2019t he Ellie At any rate he manages\nyour investments and things like that.",
    "Which can\u2019t really be very difficult\nbecause when you\u2019ve got as much money as Ellie has it sort of makes\nmore money all the time without anyone having to do much about it.",
    "Those are the main surrounding group\u201d Greta added \u201cand I have no\ndoubt that you will be meeting them fairly soon.",
    "They\u2019ll be over here to\nhave a look at you.\u201d\nI groaned and looked at Ellie.",
    "Ellie said very gently and sweetly\n\u201cNever mind Mike they\u2019ll go away again.\u201d\n\n\fTwelve\n\nThey did come over.",
    "None of them stayed very long.",
    "Not that time not\non a first visit.",
    "They came over to have a look at me.",
    "I found them\ndifficult to understand because of course they were all Americans.",
    "They\nwere types with which I was not well acquainted.",
    "Some of them were\npleasant enough.",
    "Uncle Frank for instance.",
    "I agreed with Greta about\nhim.",
    "I wouldn\u2019t have trusted him a yard.",
    "I had come across the same type\nin England.",
    "He was a big man with a bit of a paunch and pouches under\nhis eyes that gave him a dissipated look which was not far from the truth\nI imagine.",
    "He had an eye for women I thought and even more of an eye\nfor the main chance.",
    "He borrowed money from me once or twice quite\nsmall amounts just as it were something to tide him over for a day or\ntwo.",
    "I thought it was not so much that he needed the money but he\nwanted to test me out to see if I lent money easily.",
    "It was rather\nworrying because I wasn\u2019t sure which was the best way to take it.",
    "Would\nit have been better to refuse point blank and let him know I was a\nskinflint or was it better to assume an appearance of careless generosity\nwhich I was very far from feeling To hell with Uncle Frank I thought.",
    "Cora Ellie\u2019s stepmother was the one that interested me most.",
    "She\nwas a woman of about forty well turned out with tinted hair and a rather\ngushing manner.",
    "She was all sweetness to Ellie.",
    "\u201cYou mustn\u2019t mind those letters I wrote you Ellie\u201d she said.",
    "\u201cYou\nmust admit that it came as a terrible shock your marrying like that.",
    "So\nsecretly.",
    "But of course I know it was Greta who put you up to it doing it\nthat way.\u201d\n\u201cYou mustn\u2019t blame Greta\u201d said Ellie.",
    "\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to upset you all\nso much.",
    "I just thought that\u2014well the less fuss\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWell of course Ellie dear you have something there.",
    "All the men\nof business were simply livid.",
    "Stanford Lloyd and Andrew Lippincott.",
    "I\n\n\fsuppose they thought everyone would blame them for not looking after\nyou better.",
    "And of course they\u2019d no idea what Mike would be like.",
    "They\ndidn\u2019t realize how charming he was going to be.",
    "I didn\u2019t myself.\u201d\nShe smiled across at me a very sweet smile and one of the falsest\nones I\u2019d ever seen I thought to myself that if ever a woman hated a man\nit was Cora who hated me.",
    "I thought her sweetness to Ellie was\nunderstandable enough.",
    "Andrew Lippincott had gone back to America\nand had no doubt given her a few words of caution.",
    "Ellie was selling\nsome of her property in America since she herself had definitely decided\nto live in England but she was going to make a large allowance to Cora\nso that the latter could live where she chose.",
    "Nobody mentioned Cora\u2019s\nhusband much.",
    "I gathered he\u2019d already taken himself off to some other\npart of the world and had not gone there alone.",
    "In all probability I\ngathered another divorce was pending.",
    "There wouldn\u2019t be much alimony\nout of this one.",
    "Cora\u2019s last marriage had been to a man a good many\nyears younger than herself with more attractions of a physical kind than\ncash.",
    "Cora wanted that allowance.",
    "She was a woman of extravagant tastes.",
    "No doubt old Andrew Lippincott had hinted clearly enough that it could\nbe discontinued any time if Ellie chose or if Cora so far forgot herself as\nto criticize Ellie\u2019s new husband too virulently.",
    "Cousin Reuben or Uncle Reuben did not make the journey.",
    "He\nwrote instead to Ellie a pleasant noncommittal letter hoping she\u2019d be\nvery happy but doubted if she would like living in England.",
    "\u201cIf you\ndon\u2019t Ellie you come right back to the States.",
    "Don\u2019t think you won\u2019t get\na welcome here because you will.",
    "Certainly you will from your Uncle\nReuben.\u201d\n\u201cHe sounds rather nice\u201d I said to Ellie.",
    "\u201cYes\u201d said Ellie meditatively.",
    "She wasn\u2019t it seemed quite so sure\nabout it.",
    "\u201cAre you fond of any of them Ellie\u201d I asked \u201cor oughtn\u2019t I to ask\nthat\u201d\n\u201cOf course you can ask me anything.\u201d But she didn\u2019t answer for a\nmoment or two all the same.",
    "Then she said with a sort of finality and\ndecision \u201cNo I don\u2019t think I am.",
    "It seems odd but I suppose it\u2019s because\nthey don\u2019t really belong to me.",
    "Only by environment not by relationship.",
    "They none of them are my flesh and blood relations.",
    "I loved my father\nwhat I remembered of him.",
    "I think he was rather a weak man and I think\nmy grandfather was disappointed in him because he hadn\u2019t got much\nhead for business.",
    "He didn\u2019t want to go into the business life.",
    "He liked\n\n\fgoing to Florida and fishing that sort of thing.",
    "And then later he married\nCora and I never cared for Cora much\u2014or Cora for me for that matter.",
    "My own mother of course I don\u2019t remember.",
    "I liked Uncle Henry and\nUncle Joe.",
    "They were fun.",
    "In some ways more fun than my father was.",
    "He I think was in some ways a quiet and rather sad man.",
    "But the uncles\nenjoyed themselves.",
    "Uncle Joe was I think a bit wild the kind that is\nwild just because they\u2019ve got lots of money.",
    "Anyway he was the one\nwho got smashed up in the car and the other one was killed fighting in\nthe war.",
    "My grandfather was a sick man by that time and it was a terrible\nblow to him that all his three sons were dead.",
    "He didn\u2019t like Cora and he\ndidn\u2019t care much for any of his more distant relatives.",
    "Uncle Reuben for\ninstance.",
    "He said you could never tell what Reuben was up to.",
    "That\u2019s\nwhy he made arrangements to put his money in trust.",
    "A lot of it went to\nmuseums and hospitals.",
    "He left Cora well provided for and his\ndaughter\u2019s husband Uncle Frank.\u201d\n\u201cBut most of it to you\u201d\n\u201cYes.",
    "And I think that worried him a little bit.",
    "He did his best to get it\nlooked after for me.\u201d\n\u201cBy Uncle Andrew and by Mr. Stanford Lloyd.",
    "A lawyer and a\nbanker.\u201d\n\u201cYes.",
    "I suppose he didn\u2019t think I could look after it very well by\nmyself.",
    "The odd thing is that he let me come into it at the age of twentyone.",
    "He didn\u2019t keep it in trust till I was twentyfive as lots of people do.",
    "I expect that was because I was a girl.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s odd\u201d I said \u201cit would seem to me that it ought to be the\nother way round\u201d\nEllie shook her head.",
    "\u201cNo\u201d she said \u201cI think my grandfather thought\nthat young males were always wild and hit things up and that blondes\nwith evil designs got hold of them.",
    "I think he thought it would be a good\nthing if they had plenty of time to sow their wild oats.",
    "That\u2019s your\nEnglish saying isn\u2019t it But he said once to me \u2018If a girl is going to have\nany sense at all she\u2019ll have it at twentyone.",
    "It won\u2019t make any\ndifference making her wait four years longer.",
    "If she\u2019s going to be a fool\nshe\u2019ll be a fool by then just as much.\u2019 He said too\u201d Ellie looked at me\nand smiled \u201cthat he didn\u2019t think I was a fool.",
    "He said \u2018You mayn\u2019t\nknow very much about life but you\u2019ve got good sense Ellie.",
    "Especially\nabout people.",
    "I think you always will have.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t suppose he would have liked me\u201d I said thoughtfully.",
    "Ellie has a lot of honesty.",
    "She didn\u2019t try and reassure me by saying\nanything but what was undoubtedly the truth.",
    "\u201cNo\u201d she said \u201cI think he\u2019d have been rather horrified.",
    "To begin\nwith that is.",
    "He\u2019d have had to get used to you.\u201d\n\u201cPoor Ellie\u201d I said suddenly.",
    "\u201cWhy do you say that\u201d\n\u201cI said it to you once before do you remember\u201d\n\u201cYes.",
    "You said poor little rich girl.",
    "You were quite right too.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t mean it the same way this time\u201d I said.",
    "\u201cI didn\u2019t mean that\nyou were poor because you were rich.",
    "I think I meant\u2014\u201d I hesitated.",
    "\u201cYou\u2019ve too many people\u201d I said \u201cat you.",
    "All round you.",
    "Too many\npeople who want things from you but who don\u2019t really care about you.",
    "That\u2019s true isn\u2019t it\u201d\n\u201cI think Uncle Andrew really cares about me\u201d said Ellie a little\ndoubtfully.",
    "\u201cHe\u2019s always been nice to me sympathetic.",
    "The others\u2014no\nyou\u2019re quite right.",
    "They only want things.\u201d\n\u201cThey come and cadge off you don\u2019t they Borrow money off you\nwant favours.",
    "Want you to get them out of jams that sort of thing.",
    "They\u2019re at you at you at you\u201d\n\u201cI suppose it\u2019s quite natural\u201d said Ellie calmly \u201cbut I\u2019ve done with\nthem all now.",
    "I\u2019m coming to live here in England.",
    "I shan\u2019t see much of\nthem.\u201d\nShe was wrong there of course but she hadn\u2019t grasped that fact yet.",
    "Stanford Lloyd came over later by himself.",
    "He brought a great many\ndocuments and papers and things for Ellie to sign and wanted her\nagreement on investments.",
    "He talked to her about investments and shares\nand property that she owned and the disposal of trust funds.",
    "It was all\nDouble Dutch to me.",

    "I hadn\u2019t got the hang of\nthese financial things.",
    "I think everybody was being fairly careful in what\nthey said.",

    "In the lull between these worries Ellie and I discovered our Folly.",
    "We\nhadn\u2019t really explored all our property yet only the part just round the\nhouse.",

    "A sort of little\nwhite ridiculous templelooking place.",
    "It was in fairly good condition so\nwe cleared it up and had it painted and we put a table and a few chairs in\nit and a divan and a corner cupboard in which we put china and glasses\nand some bottles.",
    "It was fun really.",
    "Ellie said we\u2019d have the path cleared\nand made easier to climb and I said no it would be more fun if no one\nknew where it was except us.",
    "Ellie thought that was a romantic idea.",

    "Ellie said to me\n\n\f\u201cYou don\u2019t mind do you if Greta stays on for a bit\u201d\nI said \u201cOh no.",
    "No of course not.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s such a comfort having her\u201d said Ellie.",
    "\u201cYou see there are so\nmany sort of female things we can do together.",
    "One\u2019s awfully lonely\nwithout another woman about.\u201d\nEvery day I noticed Greta was taking a bit more upon herself giving\norders queening it over things.",
    "I pretended I liked having Greta there\nbut one day when Ellie was lying with her foot up inside the drawing\nroom and Greta and I were out on the terrace we suddenly got into a row\ntogether.",
    "I can\u2019t remember the exact words that started it.",
    "Something that\nGreta said it annoyed me and I answered sharply back.",
    "And then we\nwent on hammer and tongs.",
    "Our voices rose.",
    "She let me have it saying\nall the vicious unkind things she could think of and I pretty well gave\nher as good as I was getting.",
    "Told her she was a bossy interfering\nfemale that she\u2019d far too much influence over Ellie that I wasn\u2019t going\nto stand having Ellie bossed about the whole time.",
    "We shouted at each\nother and then suddenly Ellie came hobbling out on the terrace looking\nfrom one to the other of us and I said\n\u201cDarling I\u2019m sorry.",
    "I\u2019m terribly sorry.\u201d\nI went back into the house and settled Ellie on the sofa again.",
    "She\nsaid\n\u201cI didn\u2019t realize.",
    "I didn\u2019t realize a bit that you\u2014that you really hated\nhaving Greta here.\u201d\nI soothed her and calmed her and said she mustn\u2019t take any notice\nthat I just lost my temper that I was rather quarrelsome sometimes.",
    "I said\nall that was the matter was that I thought Greta was just a bit bossy.",
    "Perhaps that was natural enough because she\u2019d been used to being so.",
    "And in the end I said I really liked Greta very much it was just that I\u2019d\nlost my temper because I\u2019d been upset and worried.",
    "So it ended that I\npractically begged Greta to stay on.",
    "It was quite a scene we\u2019d had.",
    "I think quite a good many other people\nin the house had heard it as well.",
    "Our new manservant and his wife\ncertainly did.",
    "When I get angry I do shout.",
    "I dare say I really overdid it a\nbit.",

    "Have to notice what the dealers are doing.",
    "No.",
    "I made a bid or two but\neverything went far above my price.\u201d\nI gathered that although Phillpot owned enormous quantities of land\nround about his actual income did not amount to much.",
    "He was what\nyou might describe as a poor man though a large landowner.",
    "Only by\nselling a good portion of his land would he have had money to spend and\nhe didn\u2019t want to sell his land.",
    "He loved it.",
    "We got to the George and found a good many cars standing there\nalready.",
    "Possibly some of the people from the auction.",

    "The place was pretty crowded.",
    "I looked into the dining room but\nthey were still holding our table.",
    "There were a good many local faces\nthat I knew and sitting at a table by the window was a man whose face\nseemed familiar to me.",
    "I was sure I knew him but I couldn\u2019t remember\nwhen and where we\u2019d met.",
    "I didn\u2019t think he was a local because his\nclothes didn\u2019t fit in with these parts.",
    "Of course I\u2019ve knocked up against a\ngreat many people in my time and it is unlikely that I can remember\nthem all easily.",
    "He hadn\u2019t been at the sale as far as I could remember\nthough oddly enough there had been one face that I thought I\u2019d\nrecognized but couldn\u2019t place.",
    "Faces are tricky unless you can connect\nup when and where you\u2019d seen them.",
    "The presiding goddess of the George rustling in her usual black silk\nof affected Edwardian style which she always wore came to me and\nsaid\n\u201cWill you be coming to your table soon Mr. Rogers There\u2019s one or\ntwo waiting.\u201d\n\u201cMy wife will be here in a minute or two\u201d I said.",

    "We went on eating and passed from the steak and kidney pie to apple\ntart with a selfconscious piece of phoney pastry on top of it.",
    "\u201cI wonder if she\u2019s forgotten all about it\u201d I said suddenly.",
    "\u201cPerhaps you\u2019d better ring up.\u201d\n\u201cYes I think I\u2019d better.\u201d\nI went out to the phone and rang.",

    "I didn\u2019t know\nwhere you\u2019d gone.\u201d\nI told her I was at the George at Bartington and gave her the number.",
