    "A POCKETFUL OF RYE\n\nAgatha Christie\n\n\fChapter 1\n\nIt was Miss Somerss turn to make the tea.",
    "Miss Somers was the\nnewest and the most inefficient of the typists.",
    "She was no longer young\nand had a mild worried face like a sheep.",
    "The kettle was not quite\nboiling when Miss Somers poured the water on to the tea but poor\nMiss Somers was never quite sure when a kettle was boiling.",
    "It was\none of the many worries that afflicted her in life.",
    "She poured out the tea and took the cups round with a couple of limp\nsweet biscuits in each saucer.",
    "Miss Griffith the efficient head typist a greyhaired martinet who had\nbeen with Consolidated Investments Trust for sixteen years said\nsharply Water not boiling again Somers and Miss Somerss worried\nmeek face went pink and she said Oh dear I did think it was boiling\nthis time.",
    "Miss Griffith thought to herself.",
    "Shell last for another month perhaps\njust while were so busy...",
    "But really The mess the silly idiot made of\nthat letter to Eastern Developments  a perfectly straightforward job\nand always so stupid over the tea.",
    "If it werent so difficult to get hold of\nany intelligent typists  and the biscuit tin lid wasnt shut tightly last\ntime either.",
    "Really \n\nLike so many of Miss Griffiths indignant inner communings the\nsentence went unfinished.",
    "At that moment Miss Grosvenor sailed in to make Mr Fortescues\nsacred tea.",
    "Mr Fortescue had different tea and different china and\nspecial biscuits.",
    "Only the kettle and the water from the cloakroom tap\nwere the same.",
    "But on this occasion being Mr Fortescues tea the\nwater boiled.",
    "Miss Grosvenor saw to that.",
    "Miss Grosvenor was an incredibly glamorous blonde.",
    "She wore an\nexpensively cut little black suit and her shapely legs were encased in\nthe very best and most expensive blackmarket nylons.",
    "She sailed back through the typists room without deigning to give\nanyone a word or a glance.",
    "The typists might have been so many\nblackbeetles.",
    "Miss Grosvenor was Mr Fortescues own special\npersonal secretary unkind rumour always hinted that she was\nsomething more but actually this was not true.",
    "Mr Fortescue had\nrecently married a second wife both glamorous and expensive and\nfully capable of absorbing all his attention.",
    "Miss Grosvenor was to Mr\nFortescue just a necessary part of the office decor  which was all very\nluxurious and very expensive.",
    "Miss Grosvenor sailed back with the tray held out in front other like a\nritual offering.",
    "Through the inner office and through the waitingroom\nwhere the more important clients were allowed to sit and through her\nown anteroom and finally with a light tap on the door she entered the\nholy of holies Mr Fortescues office.",
    "It was a large room with a gleaming expanse of parquet floor on which\nwere dotted expensive oriental rugs.",
    "It was delicately panelled in pale\nwood and there were some enormous stuffed chairs upholstered in\n\n\fpale buff leather.",
    "Behind a colossal sycamore desk the centre and\nfocus of the room sat Mr Fortescue himself.",
    "Mr Fortescue was less impressive than he should have been to match\nthe room but he did his best.",
    "He was a large flabby man with a\ngleaming bald head.",
    "It was his affectation to wear loosely cut country\ntweeds in his city office.",
    "He was frowning down at some papers on his\ndesk when Miss Grosvenor glided up to him in her swanlike manner.",
    "Placing the tray on the desk at his elbow she murmured in a low\nimpersonal voice Your tea Mr Fortescue and withdrew.",
    "Mr Fortescues contribution to the ritual was a grunt.",
    "Seated at her own desk again Miss Grosvenor proceeded with the\nbusiness in hand.",
    "She made two telephone calls corrected some\nletters that were lying there typed ready for Mr Fortescue to sign and\ntook one incoming call.",
    "Aym afraid its impossible just now she said in haughty accents.",
    "Mr\nFortescue is in conference.",
    "As she laid down the receiver she glanced at the clock.",
    "It was ten\nminutes past eleven.",
    "It was just then that an unusual sound penetrated through the almost\nsoundproof door of Mr Fortescues office.",
    "Muffled it was yet fully\nrecognisable a strangled agonised cry.",
    "At the same moment the\nbuzzer on Miss Grosvenors desk sounded in a longdrawn frenzied\nsummons.",
    "Miss Grosvenor startled for a moment into complete\nimmobility rose uncertainly to her feet.",
    "Confronted by the unexpected\n\n\fher poise was shaken.",
    "However she moved towards Mr Fortescues\ndoor in her usual statuesque fashion tapped and entered.",
    "What she saw upset her poise still further.",
    "Her employer behind his\ndesk seemed contorted with agony.",
    "His convulsive movements were\nalarming to watch.",
    "Miss Grosvenor said Oh dear Mr Fortescue are you ill and was\nimmediately conscious of the idiocy of the question.",
    "There was no\ndoubt but that Mr Fortescue was very seriously ill.",
    "Even as she came\nup to him his body was convulsed in a painful spasmodic movement.",
    "Words came out in jerky gasps.",
    "Tea  what the hell  you put in the tea  get help  quick get a doctor \n\nMiss Grosvenor fled from the room.",
    "She was no longer the supercilious\nblonde secretary  she was a thoroughly frightened woman who had\nlost her head.",
    "She came running into the typists office crying out\n\nMr Fortescues having a fit  hes dying  we must get a doctor  he\nlooks awful  Im sure hes dying.",
    "Reactions were immediate and varied a good deal.",
    "Miss Bell the youngest typist said If its epilepsy we ought to put a\ncork in his mouth.",
    "Whos got a cork\n\n\fNobody had a cork.",
    "Miss Somers said At his age its probably apoplexy.",
    "Miss Griffith said We must get a doctor at once.",
    "But she was hampered in her usual efficiency because in all her\nsixteen years of service it had never been necessary to call a doctor to\nthe city office.",
    "There was her own doctor but that was at Streatham\nHill.",
    "Where was there a doctor near here\n\nNobody knew.",
    "Miss Bell seized a telephone directory and began\nlooking up Doctors under D. But it was not a classified directory and\ndoctors were not automatically listed like taxi ranks.",
    "Someone\nsuggested a hospital but which hospital It has to be the right\nhospital Miss Somers insisted or else they wont come.",
    "Because of\nthe National Health I mean.",
    "Its got to be in the area.",
    "Someone suggested 999 but Miss Griffith was shocked at that and said\nit would mean the police and that would never do.",
    "For citizens of a\ncountry which enjoyed the benefits of Medical Service for all a group\nof quite reasonably intelligent women showed incredible ignorance of\ncorrect procedure.",
    "Miss Bell started looking up Ambulances under A.",
    "Miss Griffith said Theres his own doctor  he must have a doctor.",
    "Someone rushed for the private address book.",
    "Miss Griffith instructed\nthe office boy to go out and find a doctor  somehow anywhere.",
    "In the\nprivate address book.",
    "Miss Griffith found Sir Edwin Sandeman with an\naddress in Harley Street.",
    "Miss Grosvenor collapsed in a chair wailed\nin a voice whose accent was noticeably less Mayfair than usual I\n\n\fmade the tea just as usual  reely I did  there couldnt have been\nanything wrong in it.",
    "Wrong in it Miss Griffith paused her hand on the dial of the\ntelephone.",
    "Why do you say that\n\nHe said it  Mr Fortescue  he said it was the tea \n\nMiss Griffiths hand hovered irresolutely between Welbeck and 999.",
    "Miss Bell young and hopeful said We ought to give him some\nmustard and water  Mow.",
    "Isnt there any mustard in the office\n\nThere was no mustard in the office.",
    "Some short while later Dr Isaacs of Bethnal Green and Sir Edwin\nSandeman met in the elevator just as two different ambulances drew\nup in front of the building.",
    "The telephone and the office boy had done\ntheir work.",
    "Chapter 2\n\nInspector Neele sat in Mr Fortescues sanctum behind Mr Fortescues\nvast sycamore desk.",
    "One of his underlings with a notebook sat\nunobtrusively against the wall near the door.",
    "Inspector Neele had a smart soldierly appearance with crisp brown\nhair growing back from a rather low forehead.",
    "When he uttered the\nphrase just a matter of routine those addressed were wont to think\nspitefully And routine is about all youre capable of They would\nhave been quite wrong.",
    "Behind his unimaginative appearance.",
    "Inspector Neele was a highly imaginative thinker and one of his\nmethods of investigation was to propound to himself fantastic theories\nof guilt which he applied to such persons as he was interrogating at\nthe time.",
    "Miss Griffith whom he had at once picked out with an unerring eye as\nbeing the most suitable person to give him a succinct account of the\nevents which had led to his being seated where he was had just left\nthe room having given him an admirable resume of the mornings\nhappenings.",
    "Inspector Neele propounded to himself three separate\nhighly coloured reasons why the faithful doyenne of the typists room\nshould have poisoned her employers midmorning cup of tea and\nrejected them as unlikely.",
    "He classified Miss Griffith as a Not the type of a poisoner b Not in\nlove with her employer c No pronounced mental instability d Not a\nwoman who cherished grudges.",
    "That really seemed to dispose of Miss\nGriffith except as a source of accurate information.",
    "Inspector Neele glanced at the telephone.",
    "He was expecting a call\nfrom St Judes Hospital at any moment now.",
    "It was possible of course that Mr Fortescues sudden illness was due\nto natural causes but Dr Isaacs of Bethnal Green had not thought so\nand Sir Edwin Sandeman of Harley Street had not thought so.",
    "Inspector Neele pressed a buzzer conveniently situated at his left\nhand and demanded that Mr Fortescues personal secretary should be\nsent in to him.",
    "Miss Grosvenor had recovered a little of her poise but not much.",
    "She\ncame in apprehensively with nothing of the swanlike glide about her\nmotions and said at once defensively\n\nI didnt do it\n\nInspector Neele murmured conversationally No\n\nHe indicated the chair where Miss Grosvenor was wont to place\nherself pad in hand when summoned to take down Mr Fortescues\nletters.",
    "She sat down now with reluctance and eyed Inspector Neele in\nalarm.",
    "Inspector Neele his mind playing imaginatively on the themes\nSeduction Blackmail Platinum Blonde in Court etc.",
    "looked\nreassuring and just a little stupid.",
    "There wasnt anything wrong with the tea said Miss Grosvenor.",
    "There couldnt have been.",
    "I see said Inspector Neele.",
    "Your name and address please\n\nGrosvenor.",
    "Irene Grosvenor.",
    "How do you spell it\n\nOh.",
    "Like the Square.",
    "And your address\n\n14 Rushmoor Road Muswell Hill.",
    "Inspector Neele nodded in a satisfied fashion.",
    "No seduction he said to himself.",
    "No Love Nest.",
    "Respectable home\nwith parents.",
    "No blackmail.",
    "Another good set of speculative theories washed out.",
    "And so it was you who made the tea he said pleasantly.",
    "Well I had to.",
    "I always do I mean.",
    "Unhurried Inspector Neele took her closely through the morning ritual\nof Mr Fortescues tea.",
    "The cup and saucer and teapot had already\nbeen packed up and dispatched to the appropriate quarter for\nanalysis.",
    "Now Inspector Neele learned that Irene Grosvenor and only\nIrene Grosvenor had handled that cup and saucer and teapot.",
    "The\nkettle had been used for making the office tea and had been refilled\nfrom the cloakroom tap by Miss Grosvenor.",
    "And the tea itself\n\nIt was Mr Fortescues own tea special China tea.",
    "Its kept on the shelf\nin my room next door.",
    "Inspector Neele nodded.",
    "He inquired about sugar and heard that Mr\nFortescue didnt take sugar.",
    "The telephone rang.",
    "Inspector Neele picked up the receiver.",
    "His face\nchanged a little.",
    "St Judes\n\nHe nodded to Miss Grosvenor in dismissal.",
    "Thats all for now thank you Miss Grosvenor.",
    "Miss Grosvenor sped out of the room hurriedly.",
    "Inspector Neele listened carefully to the thin unemotional tones\nspeaking from St Judes Hospital.",
    "As the voice spoke he made a few\ncryptic signs with a pencil on the corner of the blotter in front of him.",
    "Died five minutes ago you say he asked.",
    "His eye went to the watch\non his wrist.",
    "Twelve fortythree he wrote on the blotter.",
    "The unemotional voice said that Doctor Bernsdorff himself would like\nto speak to Inspector Neele.",
    "Inspector Neele said Right.",
    "Put him through which rather\nscandalised the owner of the voice who had allowed a certain amount\nof reverence to seep into the official accents.",
    "There were then various clicks buzzes and faroff ghostly murmurs.",
    "Inspector Neele sat patiently waiting.",
    "Then without warning a deep bass roar caused him to shift the\nreceiver an inch or two away from his ear.",
    "Hallo Neele you old vulture.",
    "At it again with your corpses\n\n\fInspector Neele and Professor Bernsdorff of St Judes had been\nbrought together over a case of poisoning just over a year ago and had\nremained on friendly terms.",
    "Our mans dead I hear doc.",
    "Yes.",
    "We couldnt do anything by the time he got here.",
    "And the cause of death\n\nThere will have to be an autopsy naturally.",
    "Very interesting case.",
    "Very interesting indeed.",
    "Glad I was able to be in on it.",
    "The professional gusto in Bernsdorffs rich tones told Inspector Neele\none thing at least.",
    "I gather you dont think it was natural death he said dryly.",
    "Not a dogs chance of it said Dr Bernsdorff robustly.",
    "Im speaking\nunofficially of course he added with belated caution.",
    "Of course.",
    "Of course.",
    "Thats understood.",
    "He was poisoned\n\nDefinitely.",
    "And whats more  this is quite unofficial you understand just between you and me  Id be prepared to make a bet on what the\npoison was.",
    "Indeed\n\nTaxine my boy.",
    "Taxine.",
    "Taxine Never heard of it.",
    "I know.",
    "Most unusual.",
    "Really delightfully unusual I dont say Id have\nspotted it myself if I hadnt had a case only three or four weeks ago.",
    "Couple of kids playing dolls teaparties  pulled berries off a yew tree\nand used them for tea.",
    "Is that what it is Yew berries\n\nBerries or leaves.",
    "Highly poisonous.",
    "Taxine of course is the alkaloid.",
    "Dont think Ive heard of a case where it was used deliberately.",
    "Really\nmost interesting and unusual... Youve no idea Neele how tired one\ngets of the inevitable weedkiller.",
    "Taxine is a real treat.",
    "Of course I\nmay be wrong  dont quote me for Heavens sake  but I dont think so.",
    "Interesting for you too I should think.",
    "Varies the routine\n\nA good time is to be had by all is that the idea With the exception of\nthe victim.",
    "Yes yes poor fellow.",
    "Dr Bernsdorffs tone was perfunctory.",
    "Very\nbad luck on him.",
    "Did he say anything before he died\n\nWell one of your fellows was sitting by him with a notebook.",
    "Hell\nhave the exact details.",
    "He muttered something once about tea  that\nhed been given something in his tea at the office  but thats nonsense\nof course.",
    "Why is it nonsense Inspector Neele who had been reviewing\nspeculatively the picture of the glamorous Miss Grosvenor adding yew\nberries to a brew of tea and finding it incongruous spoke sharply.",
    "Because the stuff couldnt possibly have worked so soon.",
    "I\nunderstand the symptoms came on immediately he had drunk the\ntea\n\nThats what they say.",
    "Well there are very few poisons that act as quickly as that apart from\nthe cyanides of course  and possibly pure nicotine \n\nAnd it definitely wasnt cyanide or nicotine\n\nMy dear fellow.",
    "Hed have been dead before the ambulance arrived.",
    "Oh no theres no question of anything of that kind.",
    "I did suspect\nstrychnine but the convulsions were not at all typical.",
    "Still unofficial\nof course but Ill stake my reputation its taxine.",
    "How long would that take to work\n\nDepends.",
    "An hour.",
    "Two hours three hours.",
    "Deceased looked like a\nhearty eater.",
    "If he had a big breakfast that would slow things up.",
    "Breakfast said Inspector Neele thoughtfully.",
    "Yes it looks like\nbreakfast.",
    "Breakfast with the Borgias.",
    "Dr Bernsdorff laughed cheerfully.",
    "Well\ngood hunting my lad.",
    "Thanks doctor.",
    "Id like to speak to my sergeant before you ring off.",
    "Again there were clicks and buzzes and faroff ghostly voices.",
    "And\nthen the sound of heavy breathing came through an inevitable prelude\nto Sergeant Hays conversation.",
    "Sir he said urgently.",
    "Sir.",
    "Neele here.",
    "Did the deceased say anything I ought to know\n\nSaid it was in the tea.",
    "The tea he had at the office.",
    "But the M.O.",
    "says\nnot...",
    "Yes I know about that.",
    "Nothing else\n\nNo sir.",
    "But theres one thing thats odd.",
    "The suit he was wearing  I\nchecked the contents of the pockets.",
    "The usual stuff  handkerchief\nkeys change wallet  but there was one thing thats downright\npeculiar.",
    "The righthand pocket of his jacket.",
    "It had cereal in it.",
    "Cereal\n\nYes sir.",
    "What do you mean by cereal Do you mean a breakfast food\nFarmers Glory or Wheatifax Or do you mean corn or barley \n\nThats right sir.",
    "Grain it was.",
    "Looked like rye to me.",
    "Quite a lot of it.",
    "I see...",
    "Odd...",
    "But it might have been a sample  something to do with\na business deal.",
    "Quite so sir  but I thought Id better mention it.",
    "Quite right Hay.",
    "Inspector Neele sat staring ahead of him for a few moments after he\nhad replaced the telephone receiver.",
    "His orderly mind was moving\nfrom Phase I to Phase II of the inquiry  from suspicion of poisoning to\ncertainty of poisoning.",
    "Professor Bernsdorffs words may have been\nunofficial but Professor Bernsdorff was not a man to be mistaken in\nhis beliefs.",
    "Rex Fortescue had been poisoned and the poison had\nprobably been administered one to three hours before the onset of the\nfirst symptoms.",
    "It seemed probable therefore that the office staff\ncould be given a clean bill of health.",
    "Neele got up and went into the outer office.",
    "A little desultory work was\nbeing done but the typewriters were not going at full speed.",
    "Miss Griffith Can I have another word with you\n\nCertainly Mr Neele.",
    "Could some of the girls go out to lunch Its long\npast their regular time.",
    "Or would you prefer that we get something\nsent in\n\nNo.",
    "They can go to lunch.",
    "But they must return afterwards.",
    "Of course.",
    "Miss Griffith followed Neele back into the private office.",
    "She sat down\nin her composed efficient way.",
    "Without preamble Inspector Neele said\n\nI have heard from St Judes Hospital.",
    "Mr Fortescue died at 1243.",
    "Miss Griffith received the news without surprise merely shook her\nhead.",
    "I was afraid he was very ill she said.",
    "She was not Neele noted at all distressed.",
    "Will you please give me particulars of his home and family\n\nCertainly.",
    "I have already tried to get into communication with Mrs\nFortescue but it seems she is out playing golf.",
    "She was not expected\nhome to lunch.",
    "There is some uncertainty as to which course she is\nplaying on.",
    "She added in an explanatory manner They live at Baydon\nHeath you know which is a centre for three wellknown golf courses.",
    "Inspector Neele nodded.",
    "Baydon Heath was almost entirely inhabited\nby rich city men.",
    "It had an excellent train service was only twenty\nmiles from London and was comparatively easy to reach by car even in\nthe rush of morning and evening traffic.",
    "The exact address please and the telephone number\n\nBaydon Heath 3400.",
    "The name of the house is Yewtree Lodge.",
    "What The sharp query slipped out before Inspector Neele could\ncontrol it.",
    "Did you say Yewtree Lodge\n\nYes.",
    "Miss Griffith looked faintly curious but Inspector Neele had himself in\nhand again.",
    "Can you give me particulars of his family\n\nMrs Fortescue is his second wife.",
    "She is much younger than he is.",
    "They were married about two years ago.",
    "The first Mrs Fortescue has\nbeen dead a long time.",
    "There are two sons and a daughter of the first\nmarriage.",
    "The daughter lives at home and so does the elder son who is\na partner in the firm.",
    "Unfortunately he is away in the North of England\ntoday on business.",
    "He is expected to return tomorrow.",
    "When did he go away\n\nThe day before yesterday.",
    "Have you tried to get in touch with him\n\nYes.",
    "After Mr Fortescue was removed to hospital I rang up the\nMidland Hotel in Manchester where I thought he might be staying but\nhe had left early this morning.",
    "I believe he was also going to Sheffield\nand Leicester but I am not sure about that.",
    "I can give you the names of\ncertain firms in those cities whom he might be visiting.",
    "Certainly an efficient woman thought the Inspector and if she\nmurdered a man she would probably murder him very efficiently too.",
    "But he forced himself to abandon these speculations and concentrate\nonce more on Mr Fortescues home front.",
    "There is a second son you said\n\nYes.",
    "But owing to a disagreement with his father he lives abroad.",
    "Are both sons married\n\nYes.",
    "Mr Percival has been married for three years.",
    "He and his wife\noccupy a selfcontained flat in Yewtree Lodge though they are moving\ninto their own house at Baydon Heath very shortly.",
    "You were not able to get in touch with Mrs Percival Fortescue when\nyou rang this morning\n\nShe had gone to London for the day.",
    "Miss Griffith went on Mr\nLancelot got married less than a year ago.",
    "To the widow of Lord\nFrederick Anstice.",
    "I expect youve seen pictures of her.",
    "In the Tatler with horses you know.",
    "And at pointtopoints.",
    "Miss Griffith sounded a little breathless and her cheeks were faintly\nflushed.",
    "Neele who was quick to catch the moods of human beings\nrealised that this marriage had thrilled the snob and the romantic in\nMiss Griffith.",
    "The aristocracy was the aristocracy to Miss Griffith and\nthe fact that the late Lord Frederick Anstice had had a somewhat\nunsavoury reputation in sporting circles was almost certainly not\nknown to her.",
    "Freddie Anstice had blown his brains out just before an\n\n\finquiry by the Stewards into the running of one of his horses.",
    "Neele\nremembered something vaguely about his wife.",
    "She had been the\ndaughter of an Irish Peer and had been married before to an airman\nwho had been killed in the Battle of Britain.",
    "And now it seemed she was married to the black sheep of the\nFortescue family for Neele assumed that the disagreement with his\nfather referred to primly by Miss Griffith stood for some disgraceful\nincident in young Lancelot Fortescues career.",
    "Lancelot Fortescue What a name And what was the other son Percival He wondered what the first Mrs Fortescue had been like\nShed had a curious taste in Christian names...",
    "He drew the phone towards him and dialled TOL.",
    "He asked for Baydon\nHeath 3400.",
    "Presently a mans voice said Baydon Heath 3400.",
    "I want to speak to Mrs Fortescue or Miss Fortescue.",
    "Sorry.",
    "They arent in either of em.",
    "The voice struck Inspector Neele as slightly alcoholic.",
    "Are you the butler\n\nThats right.",
    "Mr Fortescue has been taken seriously ill.",
    "I know.",
    "They rung up and said so.",
    "But theres nothing I can do about\nit.",
    "Mr Vals away up North and Mrs Fortescues out playing golf.",
    "Mrs\nVals gone up to London but shell be back for dinner and Miss Elaines\nout with her Brownies.",
    "Is there no one in the house I can speak to about Mr Fortescues\nillness Its important.",
    "Well  I dont know.",
    "The man sounded doubtful.",
    "Theres Miss\nRamsbottom  but she dont ever speak over the phone.",
    "Or theres Miss\nDove  shes what you might call the ousekeeper.",
    "Ill speak to Miss Dove please.",
    "Ill try and get hold of her.",
    "His retreating footsteps were audible through the phone.",
    "Inspector\nNeele heard no approaching footsteps but a minute or two later a\nwomans voice spoke.",
    "This is Miss Dove speaking.",
    "The voice was low and well poised with clearcut enunciation.",
    "Inspector Neele formed a favourable picture of Miss Dove.",
    "I am sorry to have to tell you.",
    "Miss Dove that Mr Fortescue died in St\nJudes Hospital a short time ago.",
    "He was taken suddenly ill in his\noffice.",
    "I am anxious to get in touch with his relatives \n\n\fOf course.",
    "I had no idea  She broke off.",
    "Her voice held no agitation\nbut it was shocked.",
    "She went on It is all most unfortunate.",
    "The\nperson you really want to get in touch with is Mr Percival Fortescue.",
    "He would be the one to see to all the necessary arrangements.",
    "You\nmight be able to get in touch with him at the Midland in Manchester or\npossibly at the Grand in Leicester.",
    "Or you might try Shearer and Bonds\nof Leicester.",
    "I dont know their telephone number Im afraid but I\nknow they are a firm on whom he was going to call and they might be\nable to inform you where he would be likely to be today.",
    "Mrs Fortescue\nwill certainly be in to dinner and she may be in to tea.",
    "It will be a great\nshock to her.",
    "It must have been very sudden Mr Fortescue was quite\nwell when he left here this morning.",
    "You saw him before he left\n\nOh yes.",
    "What was it Heart\n\nDid he suffer from heart trouble\n\nNo  no  I dont think so  But I thought as it was so sudden  She\nbroke off.",
    "Are you speaking from St Judes Hospital Are you a\ndoctor\n\nNo Miss Dove Im not a doctor.",
    "Im speaking from Mr Fortescues\noffice in the city.",
    "I am DetectiveInspector Neele of the C.I.D.",
    "and I\nshall be coming down to see you as soon as I can get there.",
    "Detective Inspector Do you mean  what do you mean\n\n\fIt was a case of sudden death.",
    "Miss Dove and when there is a sudden\ndeath we get called to the scene especially when the deceased man\nhasnt seen a doctor lately  which I gather was the case\n\nIt was only the faintest suspicion of a question mark but the young\nwoman responded.",
    "I know.",
    "Percival made an appointment twice for him but he wouldnt\nkeep it.",
    "He was quite unreasonable  theyve all been worried \n\nShe broke off and then resumed in her former assured manner\n\nIf Mrs Fortescue returns to the house before you arrive what do you\nwant me to tell her\n\nPractical as they make em thought Inspector Neele.",
    "Aloud he said\n\nJust tell her that in a case of sudden death we have to make a few\ninquiries.",
    "Routine inquiries.",
    "He hung up.",
    "Chapter 3\n\nNeele pushed the telephone away and looked sharply at Miss Griffith.",
    "So theyve been worried about him lately he said.",
    "Wanted him to\nsee a doctor.",
    "You didnt tell me that.",
    "I didnt think of it said Miss Griffith and added He never seemed to\nme really ill \n\nNot ill  but what\n\nWell just odd.",
    "Unlike himself.",
    "Peculiar in his manner.",
    "Worried about something\n\nOh no not worried.",
    "Its we who were worried \n\nInspector Neele waited patiently.",
    "Its difficult to say really said Miss Griffith.",
    "He had moods you\nknow.",
    "Sometimes he was quite boisterous.",
    "Once or twice frankly I\nthought he had been drinking...",
    "He boasted and told the most\nextraordinary stories which Im sure couldnt possibly have been true.",
    "For most of the time Ive been here he was always very close about his\naffairs  not giving anything away you know.",
    "But lately hes been quite\ndifferent expansive and positively  well  flinging money about.",
    "Most\nunlike his usual manner.",
    "Why when the office boy had to go to his\ngrandmothers funeral Mr Fortescue called him in and gave him a five\npound note and told him to put it on the second favourite and then\nroared with laughter.",
    "He wasnt  well he just wasnt like himself.",
    "Thats all I can say.",
    "As though perhaps he had something on his mind\n\n\fNot in the usual meaning of the term.",
    "It was as though he were\nlooking forward to something pleasurable  exciting \n\nPossibly a big deal that he was going to pull off\n\nMiss Griffith agreed with more conviction.",
    "Yes  yes thats much more what I mean.",
    "As though everyday things\ndidnt matter any more.",
    "He was excited.",
    "And some very oddlooking\npeople came to see him on business.",
    "People whod never been here\nbefore.",
    "It worried Mr Percival dreadfully.",
    "Oh it worried him did it\n\nYes.",
    "Mr Percivals always been very much in his fathers confidence\nyou see.",
    "His father relied on him.",
    "But lately \n\nLately they werent getting along so well.",
    "Well Mr Fortescue was doing a lot of things that Mr Percival thought\nunwise.",
    "Mr Percival is always very careful and prudent.",
    "But suddenly\nhis father didnt listen to him any more and Mr Percival was very\nupset.",
    "And they had a real row about it all\n\nInspector Neele was still probing.",
    "I dont know about a row... Of course I realise now Mr Fortescue cant\nhave been himself  shouting like that.",
    "Shouted did he What did he say\n\nHe came right out in the typists room \n\nSo that you all heard\n\nWell  yes.",
    "And he called Percival names  abused him  swore at him... What did\nhe say Percival had done\n\nIt was more that he hadnt done anything... e called him a miserable\npettifogging little clerk.",
    "He said he had no large outlook no conception\nof doing business in a big way.",
    "He said I shall get Lance home again.",
    "Hes worth ten of you  and hes married well.",
    "Lance has got guts even\nif he did risk a criminal prosecution once   Oh dear I oughtnt to have\nsaid that Miss Griffith carried away as others before her had been\nunder Inspector Neeles expert handling was suddenly overcome with\nconfusion.",
    "Dont worry said Inspector Neele comfortingly.",
    "Whats past is\npast.",
    "Oh yes it was a long time ago.",
    "Mr Lance was just young and high\nspirited and didnt really realise what he was doing.",
    "Inspector Neele had heard that view before and didnt agree with it.",
    "But he passed on to fresh questions.",
    "Tell me a little more about the staff here.",
    "Miss Griffith hurrying to get away from her indiscretion poured out\ninformation about the various personalities in the firm.",
    "Inspector Neele\nthanked her and then said he would like to see Miss Grosvenor again.",
    "DetectiveConstable Waite sharpened his pencil.",
    "He remarked\nwistfully that this was a Ritzy joint.",
    "His glance wandered appreciatively\nover the huge chairs the big desk and the indirect lighting.",
    "All these people have got Ritzy names too he said.",
    "Grosvenor thats something to do with a Duke.",
    "And Fortescue  thats a classy\nname too.",
    "Inspector Neele smiled.",
    "His fathers name wasnt Fortescue.",
    "Fontescu  and he came from\nsomewhere in Central Europe.",
    "I suppose this man thought Fortescue\nsounded better.",
    "DetectiveConstable Waite looked at his superior officer with awe.",
    "So you know all about him\n\nI just looked up a few things before coming along on the call.",
    "Not got a record had he\n\nOh no.",
    "Mr Fortescue was much too clever for that.",
    "Hes had certain\nconnections with the Black Market and put through one or two deals\n\n\fthat are questionable to say the least of it but theyve always been just\nwithin the law.",
    "I see said Waite.",
    "Not a nice man.",
    "A twister said Neele.",
    "But weve got nothing on him.",
    "The Inland\nRevenue have been after him for a long time but hes been too clever\nfor them.",
    "Quite a financial genius the late Mr Fortescue.",
    "The sort of man said Constable Waite who might have enemies\n\nHe spoke hopefully.",
    "Oh yes  certainly enemies.",
    "But he was poisoned at home remember.",
    "Or so it would seem.",
    "You know Waite I see a kind of pattern\nemerging.",
    "An oldfashioned familiar kind of pattern.",
    "The good boy\nPercival.",
    "The bad boy.",
    "Lance  attractive to women.",
    "The wife whos\nyounger than her husband and whos vague about which course shes\ngoing to play golf on.",
    "Its all very very familiar.",
    "But theres one thing\nthat sticks out in a most incongruous way.",
    "Constable Waite asked Whats that just as the door opened and\nMiss Grosvenor her poise restored and once more her glamorous\nself inquired haughtily\n\nYou wished to see me\n\nI wanted to ask you a few questions about your employer  your late\nemployer perhaps I should say.",
    "Poor soul said Miss Grosvenor unconvincingly.",
    "I want to know if you have noticed any difference in him lately.",
    "Well yes.",
    "I did as a matter of fact.",
    "In what way\n\nI couldnt really say...",
    "He seemed to talk a lot of nonsense.",
    "I couldnt\nreally believe half of what he said.",
    "And then he lost his temper very\neasily  especially with Mr Percival.",
    "Not with me because of course I\nnever argue.",
    "I just say Yes Mr Fortescue whatever peculiar thing he\nsays  said I mean.",
    "Did he  ever  well  make any passes at you\n\nMiss Grosvenor replied rather regretfully\n\nWell no I couldnt exactly say that.",
    "Theres just one other thing.",
    "Miss Grosvenor.",
    "Was Mr Fortescue in the\nhabit of carrying grain about in his pocket\n\nMiss Grosvenor displayed a lively surprise.",
    "Grain In his pocket Do you mean to feed pigeons or something\n\nIt could have been for that purpose.",
    "Oh Im sure he didnt.",
    "Mr Fortescue Feed pigeons Oh no.",
    "Could he have had barley  or rye  in his pocket today for any special\nreason A sample perhaps Some deal in grain\n\nOh no.",
    "He was expecting the Asiatic Oil people this afternoon.",
    "And\nthe President of the Atticus Building Society... No one else.",
    "Oh well  Neele dismissed the subject and Miss Grosvenor with a\nwave of the hand.",
    "Lovely legs shes got said Constable Waite with a sigh.",
    "And super\nnylons \n\nLegs are no help to me said Inspector Neele.",
    "Im left with what I\nhad before.",
    "A pocketful of rye  and no explanation of it.",
    "Chapter 4\n\nMary Dove paused on her way downstairs and looked out through the\nbig window on the stairs.",
    "A car had just driven up from which two men\nwere alighting.",
    "The taller of the two stood for a moment with his back\nto the house surveying his surroundings.",
    "Mary Dove appraised the two\nmen thoughtfully.",
    "Inspector Neele and presumably a subordinate.",
    "She turned from the window and looked at herself in the fulllength\nmirror that hung on the wall where the staircase turned... She saw a\nsmall demure figure with immaculate white collar and cuffs on a beige\ngrey dress.",
    "Her dark hair was parted in the middle and drawn back in\ntwo shining waves to a knot in the back of the neck...",
    "The lipstick she\nused was a pale rose colour.",
    "On the whole Mary Dove was satisfied with her appearance.",
    "A very\nfaint smile on her lips she went on down the stairs.",
    "Inspector Neele surveying the house was saying to himself Call it a\nlodge indeed Yewtree Lodge The affectation of these rich people\nThe house was what he.",
    "Inspector Neele would call a mansion.",
    "He\nknew what a lodge was.",
    "Hed been brought up in one The lodge at the\ngates of Hartington Park that vast unwieldy Palladian house with its\ntwentynine bedrooms which had now been taken over by the National\nTrust.",
    "The lodge had been small and attractive from the outside and\nhad been damp uncomfortable and devoid of anything but the most\nprimitive form of sanitation within.",
    "Fortunately these facts had been\naccepted as quite proper and fitting by Inspector Neeles parents.",
    "They had no rent to pay and nothing whatever to do except open and\nshut the gates when required and there were always plenty of rabbits\nand an occasional pheasant or so for the pot.",
    "Mrs Neele had never\ndiscovered the pleasures of electric irons slow combustion stoves\nairing cupboards hot and cold water from taps and the switching on\nof light by a mere flick of a finger.",
    "In winter the Neeles had an oil lamp\nand in summer they went to bed when it got dark.",
    "They were a healthy\nfamily and a happy one all thoroughly behind the times.",
    "So when Inspector Neele heard the word Lodge it was his childhood\nmemories that stirred.",
    "But this place this pretentiously named\nYewtree Lodge was just the kind of mansion that rich people built\nthemselves and then called it their little place in the country.",
    "It\nwasnt in the country either according to Inspector Neeles idea of the\ncountry.",
    "The house was a large solid red brick structure sprawling\nlengthwise rather than upwards with rather too many gables and a\nvast number of leaded paned windows.",
    "The gardens were highly\nartificial  all laid out in rose beds and pergolas and pools and living up\nto the name of the house with large numbers of clipped yew hedges.",
    "Plenty of yew here for anybody with a desire to obtain the raw material\nof taxine.",
    "Over on the right behind the rose pergola there was a bit of\nactual Nature left  a vast yew tree of the kind one associates with\nchurchyards its branches held up by stakes  like a kind of Moses of\nthe forest world.",
    "That tree the Inspector thought had been there long\nbefore the rash of newly built red brick houses had begun to spread\nover the countryside.",
    "It had been there before the golf courses had\nbeen laid out and the fashionable architects had walked round with\ntheir rich clients pointing out the advantages of the various sites.",
    "And\nsince it was a valuable antique the tree had been kept and\n\n\fincorporated in the new set up and had perhaps given its name to the\nnew desirable residence.",
    "Yewtreee Lodge.",
    "And possibly the berries\nfrom that very tree \n\nInspector Neele cut off these unprofitable speculations.",
    "Must get on\nwith the job.",
    "He rang the bell.",
    "It was opened promptly by a middleaged man who fitted in quite\naccurately with the mental image Inspector Neele had formed of him\nover the phone.",
    "A man with a rather spurious air of smartness a shifty\neye and a rather unsteady hand.",
    "Inspector Neele announced himself and his subordinate and had the\npleasure of seeing an instant look of alarm come into the butlers eye...\nNeele did not attach too much importance to that.",
    "It might easily have\nnothing to do with the death of Rex Fortescue.",
    "It was quite possibly a\npurely automatic reaction.",
    "Has Mrs Fortescue returned yet\n\nNo sir.",
    "Nor Mr Percival Fortescue Nor Miss Fortescue\n\nNo sir.",
    "Then I would like to see Miss Dove please.",
    "The man turned his head slightly.",
    "Heres Miss Dove now  coming downstairs.",
    "Inspector Neele took in Miss Dove as she came composedly down the\nwide staircase.",
    "This time the mental picture did not correspond with\nthe reality.",
    "Unconsciously the word housekeeper had conjured up a\nvague impression of someone large and authoritative dressed in black\nwith somewhere concealed about her a jingle of keys.",
    "The Inspector was quite unprepared for the small trim figure\ndescending towards him.",
    "The soft dovecoloured tones other dress\nthe white collar and cuffs the neat waves of hair the faint Mona Lisa\nsmile.",
    "It all seemed somehow just a little unreal as though this young\nwoman of under thirty was playing a part not he thought the part of a\nhousekeeper but the part of Mary Dove.",
    "Her appearance was directed\ntowards living up to her name.",
    "She greeted him composedly.",
    "Inspector Neele\n\nYes.",
    "This is Sergeant Hay.",
    "Mr Fortescue as I told you through the\nphone died in St Judes Hospital at 1243.",
    "It seems likely that his death\nwas the result of something he ate at breakfast this morning.",
    "I should\nbe glad therefore if Sergeant Hay could be taken to the kitchen where\nhe can make inquiries as to the food served.",
    "Her eyes met his for a moment thoughtfully then she nodded.",
    "Of course she said.",
    "She turned to the uneasily hovering butler.",
    "Crump will you take Sergeant Hay out and show him whatever he\nwants to see.",
    "The two men departed together.",
    "Mary Dove said to Neele\n\nWill you come in here\n\nShe opened the door of a room and preceded him into it.",
    "It was a\ncharacterless apartment clearly labelled Smoking Room with\npanelling rich upholstery large stuffed chairs and a suitable set of\nsporting prints on the walls.",
    "Please sit down.",
    "He sat and Mary Dove sat opposite him.",
    "She chose he noticed to face\nthe light.",
    "An unusual preference for a woman.",
    "Still more unusual if a\nwoman had anything to hide.",
    "But perhaps Mary Dove had nothing to\nhide.",
    "It is very unfortunate she said that none of the family is available.",
    "Mrs Fortescue may return at any minute.",
    "And so may Mrs Val.",
    "I have\nsent wires to Mr Percival Fortescue at various places.",
    "Thank you Miss Dove.",
    "You say that Mr Fortescues death was caused by something he may\nhave eaten for breakfast Food poisoning you mean\n\nPossibly.",
    "He watched her.",
    "She said composedly It seems unlikely.",
    "For breakfast this morning\nthere were bacon and scrambled eggs coffee toast and marmalade.",
    "There was also a cold ham on the sideboard but that had been cut\nyesterday and no one felt any ill effects.",
    "No fish of any kind was\nserved no sausages  nothing like that.",
    "I see you know exactly what was served.",
    "Naturally.",
    "I order the meals.",
    "For dinner last night \n\nNo.",
    "Inspector Neele interrupted her.",
    "It would not be a question of\ndinner last night.",
    "I thought the onset of food poisoning could sometimes be delayed as\nmuch as twentyfour hours.",
    "Not in this case... Will you tell me exactly what Mr Fortescue ate and\ndrank before leaving the house this morning\n\nHe had early tea brought to his room at eight oclock.",
    "Breakfast was\nat a quarter past nine.",
    "Mr Fortescue as I have told you had scrambled\neggs bacon coffee toast and marmalade.",
    "Any cereal\n\nNo he didnt like cereals.",
    "The sugar for the coffee  is it lump sugar or granulated\n\n\fLump.",
    "But Mr Fortescue did not take sugar in his coffee.",
    "Was he in the habit of taking any medicines in the morning Salts A\ntonic Some digestive remedy\n\nNo nothing of that kind.",
    "Did you have breakfast with him also\n\nNo.",
    "I do not take meals with the family.",
    "Who was at breakfast\n\nMrs Fortescue.",
    "Miss Fortescue.",
    "Mrs Val Fortescue.",
    "Mr Percival\nFortescue of course was away.",
    "And Mrs and Miss Fortescue ate the same things for breakfast\n\nMrs Fortescue has only coffee orange juice and toast Mrs Val and\nMiss Fortescue always eat a hearty breakfast.",
    "Besides eating\nscrambled eggs and cold ham they would probably have a cereal as\nwell.",
    "Mrs Val drinks tea not coffee.",
    "Inspector Neele reflected for a moment.",
    "The opportunities seemed at\nleast to be narrowing down.",
    "Three people and three people only had\nhad breakfast with the deceased his wife his daughter and his\ndaughterinlaw.",
    "Either of them might have seized an opportunity to\nadd taxine to his cup of coffee.",
    "The bitterness of the coffee would have\nmasked the bitter taste of the taxine.",
    "There was the early morning tea\nof course but Bernsdorff had intimated that the taste would be\n\n\fnoticeable in tea.",
    "But perhaps first thing in the morning before the\nsenses were alert...",
    "He looked up to find Mary Dove watching him.",
    "Your questions about tonic and medicines seem to me rather odd.",
    "Inspector she said.",
    "It seems to imply that either there was\nsomething wrong with a medicine or that something had been added\nto it.",
    "Surely neither of those processes could be described as food\npoisoning.",
    "Neele eyed her steadily.",
    "I did not say  definitely  that Mr Fortescue died of food poisoning.",
    "But some kind of poisoning.",
    "In fact  just poisoning.",
    "She repeated softly Poisoning...\n\nShe appeared neither startled nor dismayed merely interested.",
    "Her\nattitude was of one sampling a new experience.",
    "In fact she said as much remarking after a moments reflection I\nhave never had anything to do with a poisoning case before.",
    "Its not very pleasant Neele informed her dryly.",
    "No  I suppose not...\n\nShe thought about it for a moment and then looked up at him with a\nsudden smile.",
    "I didnt do it she said.",
    "But I suppose everybody will tell you that\n\nHave you any idea who did do it Miss Dove\n\nShe shrugged her shoulders.",
    "Frankly he was an odious man.",
    "Anybody might have done it.",
    "But people arent poisoned just for being odious Miss Dove.",
    "There\nusually has to be a pretty solid motive.",
    "Yes of course.",
    "She was thoughtful.",
    "Do you care to tell me something about the household here\n\nShe looked up at him.",
    "He was a little startled to find her eyes cool and\namused.",
    "This isnt exactly a statement youre asking me to make is it No it\ncouldnt be because your Sergeant is busy upsetting the domestic\nstaff.",
    "I shouldnt like to have what I say read out in court  but all the\nsame I should rather like to say it  unofficially.",
    "Off the record so to\nspeak\n\nGo ahead then.",
    "Miss Dove.",
    "Ive no witness as youve already\nobserved.",
    "She leaned back swinging one slim foot and narrowing her eyes.",
    "Let me start by saying that Ive no feeling of loyalty to my employers.",
    "I\nwork for them because its a job that pays well and I insist that it\nshould pay well.",
    "I was a little surprised to find you doing this type of job.",
    "It struck me\nthat with your brains and education \n\nI ought to be confined in an office Or compiling files in a Ministry My\ndear Inspector Neele this is the perfect racket.",
    "People will pay\nanything  anything  to be spared domestic worries.",
    "To find and\nengage a staff is a thoroughly tedious job.",
    "Writing to agencies putting\nin advertisements interviewing people making arrangements for\ninterviews and finally keeping the whole thing running smoothly  it\ntakes a certain capacity which most of these people havent got.",
    "And suppose your staff when youve assembled it runs out on you\nIve heard of such things.",
    "Mary smiled.",
    "If necessary I can make the beds dust the rooms cook a meal and\nserve it without anyone noticing the difference.",
    "Of course I dont\nadvertise that fact.",
    "It might give rise to ideas.",
    "But I can always be sure\nof tiding over any little gap.",
    "But there arent often gaps.",
    "I work only for\nthe extremely rich who will pay anything to be comfortable.",
    "I pay top\nprices and so I get the best of whats going.",
    "Such as the butler\n\n\fShe threw him an amused appreciative glance.",
    "Theres always that trouble with a couple.",
    "Crump stays because of\nMrs Crump who is one of the best cooks Ive ever come across.",
    "Shes\na jewel and one would put up with a good deal to keep her.",
    "Our Mr\nFortescue likes his food  liked I should say.",
    "In this household nobody\nhas any scruples and they have plenty of money.",
    "Butter eggs cream\nMrs Crump can command what she likes.",
    "As for Crump he just makes\nthe grade.",
    "His silvers all right and his waiting at table is not too bad.",
    "I\nkeep the key of the wine cellar and a sharp eye on the whisky and gin\nand supervise his valeting.",
    "Inspector Neele raised his eyebrows.",
    "The admirable Miss Crichton.",
    "I find one must know how to do everything oneself.",
    "Then  one need\nnever do it.",
    "But you wanted to know my impressions of the family.",
    "If you dont mind.",
    "They are really all quite odious.",
    "The late Mr Fortescue was the kind of\ncrook who is always careful to play safe.",
    "He boasted a great deal of his\nvarious smart dealings.",
    "He was rude and overbearing in manner and\nwas a definite bully.",
    "Mrs Fortescue Adele  was his second wife and\nabout thirty years younger than he was.",
    "He came across her at\nBrighton.",
    "She was a manicurist on the lookout for big money.",
    "She is\nvery good looking  a real sexy piece if you know what I mean.",
    "Inspector Neele was shocked but managed not to show it.",
    "A girl like\nMary Dove ought not to say such things he felt.",
    "The young lady was continuing composedly\n\nAdele married him for his money of course and his son Percival and\nhis daughter Elaine were simply livid about it.",
    "Theyre as nasty as\nthey can be to her but very wisely she doesnt care or even notice.",
    "She knows shes got the old man where she wants him.",
    "Oh dear the\nwrong tense again.",
    "I havent really grasped yet that hes dead...",
    "Lets hear about the son.",
    "Dear Percival Val as his wife calls him.",
    "Percival is a mealymouthed\nhypocrite.",
    "Hes prim and sly and cunning.",
    "Hes terrified of his father\nand has always let himself be bullied but hes quite clever at getting\nhis own way.",
    "Unlike his father hes mean about money.",
    "Economy is one\nof his passions.",
    "Thats why hes been so long about finding a house of\nhis own.",
    "Having a suite of rooms here saved his pocket.",
    "And his wife\n\nJennifers meek and seems very stupid.",
    "But Im not so sure.",
    "She was\na hospital nurse before her marriage  nursed Percival through\npneumonia to a romantic conclusion.",
    "The old man was disappointed by\nthe marriage.",
    "He was a snob and wanted Percival to make what he\ncalled a good marriage.",
    "He despised poor Mrs Val and snubbed her.",
    "She dislikes  disliked him a good deal I think.",
    "Her principal interests\nare shopping and the cinema her principal grievance is that her\nhusband keeps her short of money.",
    "What about the daughter\n\nElaine Im rather sorry for Elaine.",
    "Shes not a bad sort.",
    "One of those\ngreat schoolgirls who never grow up.",
    "She plays games quite well and\nruns Guides and Brownies and all that sort of thing.",
    "There was some\nsort of affair not long ago with a disgruntled young schoolmaster but\nFather discovered the young man had communistic ideas and came\ndown on the romance like a ton of bricks.",
    "She hasnt got the spirit to stand up to him\n\nShe had.",
    "It was the young man who ratted.",
    "A question of money yet\nagain I fancy.",
    "Elaine is not particularly attractive poor dear.",
    "And the other son\n\nIve never seen him.",
    "Hes attractive by all accounts and a thoroughly\nbad lot.",
    "Some little matter of a forged cheque in the past.",
    "He lives in\nEast Africa.",
    "And was estranged from his father.",
    "Yes Mr Fortescue couldnt cut him off with a shilling because hed\nalready made him a junior partner in the firm but he held no\ncommunication with him for years and in fact if Lance was ever\nmentioned he used to say Dont talk to me of that rascal.",
    "Hes no son\nof mine.",
    "All the same \n\nYes Miss Dove\n\n\fMary said slowly All the same I shouldnt be surprised if old\nFortescue hadnt been planning to get him back here.",
    "What makes you think that\n\nBecause about a month ago old Fortescue had a terrific row with\nPercival  he found out something that Percival had been doing behind\nhis back  I dont know what it was  and he was absolutely furious.",
    "Percival suddenly stopped being the whiteheaded boy.",

    "Hes gone about looking worried to death.",

    "She does the downstairs rooms lays the table\nclears away and helps Crump wait at table.",
    "Quite a decent sort of girl\nbut very nearly halfwitted.",
    "The adenoidal type.",
    "Neele nodded.",
    "The housemaid is Ellen Curtis.",
    "Elderly very crabbed and very cross\nbut has been in good service and is a firstclass housemaid.",
    "The rest is\noutside help  odd women who come in.",
    "And those are the only people living here\n\nTheres old Miss Ramsbottom.",
    "Who is she\n\nMr Fortescues sisterinlaw  his first wifes sister.",
    "His wife was a\ngood deal older than he was and her sister again was a good deal\nolder than her  which makes her well over seventy.",
    "She has a room of\nher own on the second floor  does her own cooking and all that with\njust a woman coming in to clean.",
    "Shes rather eccentric and she never\nliked her brotherinlaw but she came here while her sister was alive\nand stayed on when she died.",
    "Mr Fortescue never bothered about her\nmuch.",

    "I will type out\nthe names and addresses of my various employers and give them with\na copy of my references to Sergeant  Hay is it Will that be\nsatisfactory\n\n\fPerfectly Miss Dove.",
    "Neele was silent for a moment enjoying a\nmental image of Miss Dove tampering with Mr Fortescues breakfast.",
    "His mind went back farther and he saw her methodically gathering\nyew berries in a little basket.",
    "With a sigh he returned to the present\nand reality.",
    "Now I would like to see the girl  er Gladys  and then the\nhousemaid Ellen.",
    "He added as he rose By the way.",
    "Miss Dove can\nyou give me any idea why Mr Fortescue would be carrying loose grain\nin his pocket\n\nGrain She stared at him with what appeared to be genuine surprise.",
    "Yes  grain.",
    "Does that suggest something to you.",
    "Miss Dove\n\nNothing at all.",
    "Who looked after his clothes\n\nCrump.",
    "I see.",
    "Did Mr Fortescue and Mrs Fortescue occupy the same\nbedroom\n\nYes.",
    "He had a dressingroom and bath of course and so did she...\nMary glanced down at her wristwatch.",
    "I really think that she ought to\nbe back very soon now.",
    "The Inspector had risen.",
    "He said in a pleasant voice\n\n\fDo you know one thing.",
    "Miss Dove It strikes me as very odd that even\nthough there are three golf courses in the immediate neighbourhood it\nhas yet not been possible to find Mrs Fortescue on one of them before\nnow\n\nIt would not be so odd.",
    "Inspector if she did not actually happen to be\nplaying golf at all.",
    "Marys voice was dry.",
    "The Inspector said sharply\n\nI was distinctly informed that she was playing golf.",
    "She took her golf clubs and announced her intention of doing so.",
    "She\nwas driving her own car of course.",
    "He looked at her steadily perceiving the inference.",
    "Who was she playing with Do you know\n\nI think it possible that it might be Mr Vivian Dubois.",
    "Neele contented himself by saying I see.",
    "Ill send Gladys in to you.",
    "Shell probably be scared to death.",
    "Mary\npaused for a moment by the door then she said\n\nI should hardly advise you to go too much by all Ive told you.",
    "Im a\nmalicious creature.",
    "She went out.",
    "Inspector Neele looked at the closed door and\nwondered.",
    "Whether actuated by malice or not what she had told him\ncould not fail to be suggestive.",
    "If Rex Fortescue had been deliberately\npoisoned and it seemed almost certain that that was the case then\nthe set up at Yewtree Lodge seemed highly promising.",
    "Motives\nappeared to be lying thick on the ground.",
    "Chapter 5\n\nThe girl who entered the room with obvious unwillingness was an\nunattractive frightened looking girl who managed to look faintly\nsluttish in spite of being tall and smartly dressed in a claretcoloured\nuniform.",
    "She said at once fixing imploring eyes upon him.",
    "I didnt do anything.",
    "I didnt really.",
    "I dont know anything about it.",
    "Thats all right said Neele heartily.",
    "His voice had changed slightly.",

    "He\nwanted to put the frightened rabbit Gladys at her ease.",
    "Sit down here he went on.",
    "I just want to know about breakfast this\nmorning.",
    "I didnt do anything at all.",
    "Well you laid the breakfast didnt you\n\n\fYes I did that.",
    "Even that admission came unwillingly.",
    "She looked\nboth guilty and terrified but Inspector Neele was used to witnesses\nwho looked like that.",
    "He went on cheerfully trying to put her at her\nease asking questions who had come down first And who next\n\nElaine Fortescue had been the first down to breakfast.",
    "Shed come in\njust as Crump was bringing in the coffee pot.",
    "Mrs Fortescue was down\nnext and then Mrs Val and the master last.",
    "They waited on\nthemselves.",
    "The tea and coffee and the hot dishes were all on hot\nplates on the sideboard.",

    "Shed been in private service first and after that in various\ncafes.",
    "Then she thought shed like to go back to private service and\nhad come to Yewtree Lodge last September.",
    "Shed been there two\nmonths.",
    "And you like it\n\nWell its all right I suppose.",
    "She added Its not so hard on your feet\n but you dont get so much freedom...\n\nTell me about Mr Fortescues clothes  his suits.",
    "Who looked after\nthem Brushed them and all that\n\n\fGladys looked faintly resentful.",
    "Mr Crumps supposed to.",
    "But half the\ntime he makes me do it.",
    "Who brushed and pressed the suit Mr Fortescue had on today\n\nI dont remember which one he wore.",
    "Hes got ever so many.",
    "Have you ever found grain in the pocket of one of his suits\n\nGrain She looked puzzled.",
    "Rye to be exact.",
    "Rye Thats bread isnt it A sort of black bread  got a nasty taste I\nalways think.",
    "Thats bread made from rye.",
    "Rye is the grain itself.",
    "There was some\nfound in the pocket of your masters coat.",
    "In his coat pocket\n\nYes.",
    "Do you know how it got there\n\nI couldnt say Im sure.",
    "I never saw any.",
    "He could get no more from her.",
    "For a moment or two he wondered if\nshe knew more about the matter than she was willing to admit.",
    "She\ncertainly seemed embarrassed and on the defensive  but on the whole\nhe put it down to a natural fear of the police.",
    "When he finally dismissed her she asked\n\nIts really true is it.",
    "Hes dead\n\nYes hes dead.",
    "Very sudden wasnt it They said when they rang up from the office\nthat hed had a kind of fit.",
    "Yes  it was a kind of fit.",
    "Gladys said A girl I used to know had fits.",
    "Come on any time they did.",
    "Used to scare me.",
    "For the moment this reminiscence seemed to overcome her\nsuspicions.",
    "Inspector Neele made his way to the kitchen.",
    "His reception was immediate and alarming.",
    "A woman of vast\nproportions with a red face armed with a rollingpin stepped towards\nhim in a menacing fashion.",
    "Police indeed she said.",
    "Coming here and saying things like that\nNothing of the kind Id have you know.",
    "Anything Ive sent in to the\ndiningroom has been just what it should be.",
    "Coming here and saying I\npoisoned the master.",
    "Ill have the law on you police or no police.",
    "No\nbad foods ever been served in this house.",
    "It was some time before Inspector Neele could appease the irate\nartist.",
    "Sergeant Hay looked in grinning from the pantry and Inspector\nNeele gathered that he had already run the gauntlet of Mrs Crumps\nwrath.",
    "The scene was terminated by the ringing of the telephone.",
    "Neele went out into the hall to find Mary Dove taking the call.",
    "She was\nwriting down a message on a pad.",
    "Turning her head over her shoulder\nshe said Its a telegram.",
    "The call concluded she replaced the receiver and handed the pad on\nwhich she had been writing to the Inspector.",
    "The place of origin was\nParis and the message ran as follows\n\nFORTESCUE YEWTREE LODGE BAYDON HEATH SURREY.",
    "SORRY\nYOUR LETTER DELAYED.",
    "WILL BE WITH YOU TOMORROW ABOUT\nTEATIME.",
    "SHALL EXPECT ROAST VEAL FOR DINNER.",

    "Its all very well to say describe him Pat.",
    "Im a rotten hand at\ndescriptions.",
    "What do you want to know The Guvnors a bit of an old\ncrook you know.",
    "But you wont mind that You must be used to that\nmore or less.",
    "Oh yes said Pat.",
    "Yes  as you say  Im acclimatised.",
    "She tried to keep a certain forlornness out other voice.",
    "Perhaps she\nreflected the whole world was really crooked  or was it just that she\nherself had been unfortunate\n\nShe was a tall longlegged girl not beautiful but with a charm that was\nmade up of vitality and a warmhearted personality.",
    "She moved well\nand had lovely gleaming chestnut brown hair.",
    "Perhaps from a long\nassociation with horses she had acquired the look of a thoroughbred\nfilly.",
    "Crookedness in the racing world she knew about  now it seemed she\nwas to encounter crookedness in the financial world.",
    "Though for all\nthat it seemed that her fatherinlaw whom she had not yet met was\nas far as the law was concerned a pillar of rectitude.",
    "All these people\nwho went about boasting of smart work were the same  technically\nthey always managed to be within the law.",
    "Yet it seemed to her that her\nLance whom she loved and who had admittedly strayed outside the\nringed fence in earlier days had an honesty that these successful\npractitioners of the crooked lacked.",
    "I dont mean said Lance that hes a swindler  not anything like\nthat.",
    "But he knows how to put over a fast one.",
    "Sometimes said Pat I feel I hate people who put over fast ones.",
    "She added Youre fond of him.",
    "It was a statement not a question.",
    "Lance considered it for a moment and then said in a surprised kind of\nvoice\n\nDo you know darling I believe I am.",
    "Pat laughed.",
    "He turned his head to look at her.",
    "His eyes narrowed.",
    "What a darling she was He loved her.",
    "The whole thing was worth it for\nher sake.",
    "In a way you know he said its Hell going back.",
    "City life.",
    "Home on\nthe 518.",
    "Its not my kind of life.",
    "Im far more at home among the down\nand outs.",
    "But ones got to settle down sometime I suppose.",
    "And with\nyou to hold my hand the process may even be quite a pleasant one.",
    "And since the old boy has come round one ought to take advantage of\nit.",
    "I must say I was surprised when I got his letter... Percival of all\npeople blotting his copybook.",
    "Percival the good little boy.",
    "Mind you\nPercy was always sly.",
    "Yes he was always sly.",
    "I dont think said Patricia Fortescue that Im going to like your\nbrother Percival.",
    "Dont let me put you against him.",

    "I dont\nknow why exactly...",
    "I think I can see why.",
    "Can you darling Youre so brainy.",
    "You know Ive always wondered its a fantastic thing to say  but \n\nWell Say it.",
    "Ive wondered if it wasnt Percival who was behind that cheque\nbusiness  you know when the old man kicked me out  and was he\nmad that hed given me a share in the firm and so he couldnt disinherit\nme Because the queer thing was that I never forged that cheque though of course nobody would believe that after that time I swiped\nfunds out of the till and put it on a horse.",
    "I was dead sure I could put it\nback and anyway it was my own cash in a manner of speaking.",
    "But\nthat cheque business  no.",
    "I dont know why Ive got the ridiculous idea\nthat Percival did that  but I have somehow.",
    "But it wouldnt have done him any good It was paid into your\naccount.",
    "I know.",
    "So it doesnt make sense does it\n\nPat turned sharply towards him.",
    "You mean  he did it to get you chucked out of the firm\n\n\fI wondered.",
    "Oh well  its a rotten thing to say.",
    "Forget it.",
    "I wonder\nwhat old Percy will say when he sees the Prodigal returned.",
    "Those\npale boiled gooseberry eyes of his will pop right out of his head\n\nDoes he know you are coming\n\nI shouldnt be surprised if he didnt know a damned thing The old\nmans got rather a funny sense of humour you know.",
    "But what has your brother done to upset your father so much\n\nThats what Id like to know.",
    "Something must have made the old man\nlivid.",
    "Writing off to me the way he did.",
    "When was it you got his first letter\n\nMust be four  no five months ago.",
    "A cagey letter but a distinct\nholding out of the olive branch.",
    "Your elder brother has proved himself\nunsatisfactory in many ways.",
    "You seem to have sown your wild oats\nand settled down.",
    "I can promise you that it will be well worth your\nwhile financially.",
    "Shall welcome you and your wife.",
    "You know\ndarling I think my marrying you had a lot to do with it.",
    "The old boy was\nimpressed that Id married into a class above me.",
    "Pat laughed.",
    "What Into the aristocratic riffraff\n\n\fHe grinned.",
    "Thats right.",
    "But riffraff didnt register and aristocracy\ndid.",
    "You should see Percivals wife.",
    "Shes the kind who says Pass the\npreserves please and talks about a postage stamp.",
    "Pat did not laugh.",
    "She was considering the women of the family into\nwhich she had married.",
    "It was a point of view which Lance had not\ntaken into account.",
    "And your sister she asked.",
    "Elaine Oh shes all right.",
    "She was pretty young when I left home.",
    "Sort\nof an earnest girl  but probably shes grown out of that.",
    "Very intense\nover things.",

    "Were not a\ndevoted family.",
    "No.",

    "To and fro to the city all logged up.",
    "But dont worry\nsweet  there are rural pockets even round London.",
    "And lately Ive felt\nthe sap of financial affairs rising in me.",
    "After all its in my blood  from\nboth sides of the family.",
    "You hardly remember your mother do you\n\nShe always seemed to me incredibly old.",
    "She was old of course.",
    "Nearly fifty when Elaine was born.",
    "She wore lots of clinking things and\nlay on a sofa and used to read me stories about knights and ladies\nwhich bored me stiff.",
    "Tennysons Idylls of the King.",
    "I suppose I was\nfond other... She was very colourless you know.",

    "Mary Dove said That will be Mrs Fortescue now.",
    "Inspector Neele moved forwards to the front door.",
    "Out of the tail of his\neye he saw Mary Dove melt unobtrusively into the background and\ndisappear.",
    "Clearly she intended to take no part in the forthcoming\nscene.",
    "A remarkable display of tact and discretion  and also a rather\nremarkable lack of curiosity.",
    "Most women.",
    "Inspector Neele decided\nwould have remained...\n\nAs he reached the front door he was aware of the butler.",
    "Crump\ncoming forward from the back of the hall.",

    "Adele Fortescue was a sexy piece.",
    "In figure and type\nshe resembled the blonde Miss Grosvenor but whereas Miss\nGrosvenor was all glamour without and all respectability within Adele\nFortescue was glamour all through.",
    "Her appeal was obvious not\nsubtle.",
    "It said simply to every man Here am I. Im a woman.",
    "She\nspoke and moved and breathed sex  and yet within it all her eyes had\na shrewd appraising quality.",
    "Adele Fortescue he thought liked men but she would always like money even better.",
    "His eyes went on to the figure behind her who carried her golf clubs.",
    "He knew the type very well.",
    "It was the type that specialised in the\nyoung wives of rich and elderly men.",
    "Mr Vivian Dubois if this was he\nhad that rather forced masculinity which is in reality nothing of the\nkind.",
    "He was the type of man who understands women.",
    "Mrs Fortescue\n\nYes.",
    "It was a wide blueeyed gaze.",
    "But I dont know \n\nI am Inspector Neele.",
    "Im afraid I have bad news for you.",
    "Do you mean  a burglary  something of that kind\n\nNo nothing of that kind.",

    "An inquest Do you mean  what do you mean\n\nIm afraid this is all very distressing for you Mrs Fortescue.",
    "The\nwords came smoothly.",

    "Do you mean he might have been poisoned\n\nWell yes it would seem so.",
    "I cant believe it.",

    "Adele Fortescue said in an attempt to carry off the situation\n\nIts such a shock to come back and find the police in the house.",

    "Mrs Percival Fortescue\nwas a plump woman with a discontented mouth.",
    "Her age he judged to\nbe about thirty.",
    "Her questions came with a kind of eagerness.",
    "The\nthought flashed across his mind that she must be very bored.",
    "Im sorry to have to tell you that Mr Fortescue was taken to St Judes\nHospital this morning seriously ill and has since died.",
    "Died You mean hes dead The news was clearly even more\nsensational than she had hoped for.",
    "Dear me  this is a surprise.",
    "My\nhusbands away.",
    "Youll have to get in touch with him.",
    "Hes in the North\nsomewhere.",
    "I dare say theyll know at the office.",
    "Hell have to see to\neverything.",
    "Things always happen at the most awkward moment dont\nthey.",
    "She paused for a moment turning things over in her mind.",
    "It all depends I suppose she said where theyll have the funeral.",
    "Down here I suppose.",
    "Or will it be in London\n\nThat will be for the family to say.",
    "Of course.",
    "I only just wondered.",
    "For the first time she took direct\ncognisance of the man who was speaking to her.",
    "Are you from the office she asked.",
    "Youre not a doctor are you\n\nIm a police officer.",
    "Mr Fortescues death was very sudden and \n\nShe interrupted him.",
    "Do you mean he was murdered\n\nIt was the first time that word had been spoken.",
    "Neele surveyed her\neager questioning face carefully.",
    "Now why should you think that madam\n\nWell people are sometimes.",
    "You said sudden.",
    "And youre police.",
    "Have you seen her about it What did she say\n\nI dont quite understand to whom you are referring\n\nAdele of course.",
    "I always told Val his father was crazy to go marrying\na woman years younger than himself.",
    "Theres no fool like an old fool.",
    "Besotted about that awful creature he was.",
    "And now look what comes\nof it... A nice mess were all in.",
    "Pictures in the paper and reporters\ncoming round.",
    "She paused obviously visualising the future in a series of crude highlycoloured pictures.",
    "He thought that the prospect was still not wholly\nunpleasing.",
    "She turned back to him.",
    "What was it Arsenic\n\nIn a repressive voice Inspector Neele said\n\nThe cause of death has yet to be ascertained.",
    "There will be an\nautopsy and an inquest.",
    "But you know already dont you Or you wouldnt come down here.",
    "There was a sudden shrewdness in her plump rather foolish face.",
    "Youve been asking about what he ate and drank I suppose Dinner\nlast night.",
    "Breakfast this morning.",
    "And all the drinks of course.",
    "He could see her mind ranging vividly over all the possibilities.",
    "He said\nwith caution\n\nIt seems possible that Mr Fortescues illness resulted from something\nhe ate at breakfast.",
    "Breakfast She seemed surprised.",
    "Thats difficult.",
    "I dont see\nhow...\n\nShe paused and shook her head.",
    "I dont see how she could have done it then... unless she slipped\nsomething into the coffee  when Elaine and I werent looking...\n\nA quiet voice spoke softly beside them\n\nYour tea is all ready in the library Mrs Val.",
    "Mrs Val jumped.",
    "Oh thank you.",
    "Miss Dove.",
    "Yes I could do with a cup of tea.",
    "Really I\nfeel quite bowled over.",
    "What about you Mr  Inspector \n\nThank you not just now.",
    "The plump figure hesitated and then went slowly away.",
    "As she disappeared through a doorway Mary Dove murmured softly\n\nI dont think shes ever heard of the term slander.",
    "Inspector Neele did not reply.",
    "Mary Dove went on\n\nIs there anything I can do for you\n\nWhere can I find the housemaid Ellen\n\nI will take you to her.",
    "Shes just gone upstairs.",
    "II\n\nEllen proved to be grim but unafraid.",
    "Her sour old face looked\ntriumphantly at the Inspector.",
    "Its a shocking business sir.",
    "And I never thought Id live to find myself\nin a house where that sort of thing has been going on.",
    "But in a way I\ncant say that it surprises me.",
    "I ought to have given my notice in long\nago and thats a fact.",
    "I dont like the language thats used in this house\nand I dont like the amount of drink thats taken and I dont approve of\nthe goings on thereve been.",
    "Ive nothing against Mrs Crump but\nCrump and that girl Gladys just dont know what proper service is.",
    "But\nits the goings on that I mind about most.",
    "What goings on do you mean exactly\n\n\fYoull soon hear about them if you dont know already.",
    "Its common\ntalk all over the place.",
    "Theyve been seen here there and everywhere.",
    "All this pretending to play golf  or tennis  And Ive seen things  with\nmy own eyes  in this house.",
    "The library door was open and there they\nwere kissing and canoodling.",
    "The venom of the spinster was deadly.",
    "Neele really felt it unnecessary\nto say Whom do you mean but he said it nevertheless.",
    "Who should I mean The mistress  and that man.",
    "No shame about it\nthey hadnt.",
    "But if you ask me the master had got wise to it.",
    "Put\nsomeone on to watch them he had.",
    "Divorce thats what it would have\ncome to.",
    "Instead its come to this.",
    "When you say this you mean \n\nYouve been asking questions sir about what the master ate and\ndrank and who gave it to him.",
    "Theyre in it together sir thats what Id\nsay.",
    "He got the stuff from somewhere and she gave it to the master\nthat was the way of it Ive no doubt.",
    "Have you ever seen any yew berries in the house  or thrown away\nanywhere.",
    "The small eyes glinted curiously.",
    "Yew Nasty poisonous stuff.",
    "Never you touch those berries my\nmother said to me when I was a child.",
    "Was that what was used sir\n\nWe dont know yet what was used.",
    "Ive never seen her fiddling about with yew.",
    "Ellen sounded\ndisappointed.",
    "No I cant say Ive seen anything of that kind.",
    "Neele questioned her about the grain found in Fortescues pocket but\nhere again he drew a blank.",
    "No sir.",
    "I know nothing about that.",
    "He went on to further questions but with no gainful result.",
    "Finally he\nasked if he could see Miss Ramsbottom.",
    "Ellen looked doubtful.",
    "I could ask her but its not everyone shell see.",
    "Shes a very old lady\nyou know and shes a bit odd.",
    "The Inspector pressed his demand and rather unwillingly Ellen led him\nalong a passage and up a short flight of stairs to what he thought had\nprobably been designed as a nursery suite.",
    "He glanced out of a passage window as he followed her and saw\nSergeant Hay standing by the yew tree talking to a man who was\nevidently a gardener.",
    "Ellen tapped on a door and when she received an answer opened it\nand said\n\nTheres a police gentleman here who would like to speak to you\nmiss.",
    "The answer was apparently in the affirmative for she drew back and\nmotioned Neele to go in.",
    "The room he entered was almost fantastically overfurnished.",
    "The\nInspector felt rather as though he had taken a step backward into not\nmerely Edwardian but Victorian times.",
    "At a table drawn up to a gas fire\nan old lady was sitting laying out a patience.",
    "She wore a marooncoloured dress and her sparse grey hair was slicked down each side\nother face.",
    "Without looking up or discontinuing her game she said impatiently\n\nWell come in come in.",
    "Sit down if you like.",
    "The invitation was not easy to accept as every chair appeared to be\ncovered with tracts or publications of a religious nature.",
    "As he moved them slightly aside on the sofa Miss Ramsbottom asked\nsharply\n\nInterested in mission work\n\nWell Im afraid Im not very maam.",
    "Wrong.",
    "You should be.",
    "Thats where the Christian spirit is nowadays.",
    "Darkest Africa.",
    "Had a young clergyman here last week.",
    "Black as your\nhat.",
    "But a true Christian.",
    "Inspector Neele found it a little difficult to know what to say.",
    "The old lady further disconcerted him by snapping\n\nI havent got a wireless.",
    "I beg your pardon\n\nOh I thought perhaps you came about a wireless licence.",
    "Or one of\nthese silly forms.",
    "Well man what is it\n\nIm sorry to have to tell you.",
    "Miss Ramsbottom that your brotherinlaw Mr Fortescue was taken suddenly ill and died this morning.",
    "Miss Ramsbottom continued with her patience without any sign of\nperturbation merely remarking in a conversational way\n\nStruck down at last in his arrogance and sinful pride.",
    "Well it had to\ncome.",
    "I hope its not a shock to you\n\nIt obviously wasnt but the Inspector wanted to hear what she would\nsay.",
    "Miss Ramsbottom gave him a sharp glance over the top of her\nspectacles and said\n\nIf you mean I am not distressed that is quite right.",
    "Rex Fortescue was\nalways a sinful man and I never liked him.",
    "His death was very sudden \n\nAs befits the ungodly said the old lady with satisfaction.",
    "It seems possible that he may have been poisoned \n\nThe Inspector paused to observe the effect he had made.",
    "He did not seem to have made any.",
    "Miss Ramsbottom merely\nmurmured Red seven on black eight.",
    "Now I can move up the King.",
    "Struck apparently by the Inspectors silence she stopped with a card\npoised in her hand and said sharply\n\nWell what did you expect me to say I didnt poison him if thats what\nyou want to know.",
    "Have you any idea who might have done so\n\nThats a very improper question said the old lady sharply.",
    "Living in\nthis house are two of my dead sisters children.",
    "I decline to believe that\nanybody with Ramsbottom blood in them could be guilty of murder.",
    "Because its murder youre meaning isnt it\n\nI didnt say so madam.",
    "Of course its murder.",
    "Plenty of people have wanted to murder Rex in\ntheir time.",
    "A very unscrupulous man.",
    "And old sins have long shadows\nas the saying goes.",
    "Have you anyone in particular in mind\n\nMiss Ramsbottom swept up the cards and rose to her feet.",
    "She was a\ntall woman.",
    "I think youd better go now she said.",
    "She spoke without anger but with a kind of cold finality.",
    "If you want my opinion she went on it was probably one of the\nservants.",
    "That butler looks to me a bit of a rascal and that parlourmaid\nis definitely subnormal.",
    "Good evening.",
    "Inspector Neele found himself meekly walking out.",
    "Certainly a\nremarkable old lady.",
    "Nothing to be got out of her.",
    "He came down the stairs into the square hall to find himself suddenly\nface to face with a tall dark girl.",
    "She was wearing a damp mackintosh\nand she stared into his face with a curious blankness.",
    "Ive just come back she said.",
    "And they told me  about Father  that\nhes dead.",
    "Im afraid thats true.",
    "She pushed out a hand behind her as though blindly seeking for\nsupport.",
    "She touched an oak chest and slowly stiffly she sat down on\nit.",
    "Oh no she said.",
    "No...",
    "Slowly two tears rolled down her cheeks.",
    "Its awful she said.",
    "I didnt think that I even liked him...",
    "I thought I\nhated him...",
    "But that cant be so or I wouldnt mind.",
    "I do mind.",
    "She sat there staring in front of her and again tears forced themselves\nfrom her eyes and down her cheeks.",
    "Presently she spoke again rather breathlessly.",
    "The awful thing is that it makes everything come right.",
    "I mean Gerald\nand I can get married now.",
    "I can do everything that I want to do.",
    "But I\nhate it happening this way.",
    "I dont want Father to be dead... Oh I dont.",
    "Oh Daddy  Daddy...\n\nFor the first time since he had come to Yewtree Lodge Inspector\nNeele was startled by what seemed to be genuine grief for the dead\nman.",
    "Chapter 9\n\nSounds like the wife to me said the Assistant Commissioner.",
    "He had\nbeen listening attentively to Inspector Neeles report.",
    "It had been an admirable pr\u00e9cis of the case.",
    "Short but with no relevant\ndetail left out.",
    "Yes said the A.C.",
    "It looks like the wife.",
    "What do you think yourself\nNeele eh\n\n\fInspector Neele said that it looked like the wife to him too.",
    "He reflected\ncynically that it usually was the wife  or the husband as the case might\nbe.",
    "She had the opportunity all right.",
    "And motive The A.C. paused.",
    "There is motive\n\nOh I think so sir.",
    "This Mr Dubois you know.",
    "Think he was in it too\n\nNo I shouldnt say that sir.",
    "Inspector Neele weighed the idea.",
    "A bit\ntoo fond of his own skin for that.",
    "He may have guessed what was in her\nmind but I shouldnt imagine that he instigated it.",
    "No too careful.",
    "Much too careful.",
    "Well we mustnt jump to conclusions but it seems a good working\nhypothesis.",
    "What about the other two who had opportunity\n\nThats the daughter and the daughterinlaw.",
    "The daughter was mixed\nup with a young man whom her father didnt want her to marry.",
    "And he\ndefinitely wasnt marrying her unless she had the money.",
    "That gives\nher a motive.",
    "As to the daughterinlaw I wouldnt like to say.",
    "Dont\nknow enough about her yet.",
    "But any of the three of them could have\npoisoned him and I dont see how anyone else could have done so.",
    "The parlourmaid the butler the cook they all handled the breakfast or\n\n\fbrought it in but I dont see how any of them could have been sure of\nFortescue himself getting the taxine and nobody else.",
    "That is if it was\ntaxine.",
    "The A.C. said It was taxine all right.",
    "Ive just got the preliminary\nreport.",
    "That settles that then said Inspector Neele.",
    "We can go ahead.",
    "Servants seem all right\n\nThe butler and the parlourmaid both seem nervous.",
    "Theres nothing\nuncommon about that.",
    "Often happens.",
    "The cooks fighting mad and the\nhousemaid was grimly pleased.",
    "In fact all quite natural and normal.",
    "Theres nobody else whom you consider suspicious in any way\n\nNo I dont think so sir.",
    "Involuntarily Inspector Neeles mind went\nback to Mary Dove and her enigmatic smile.",
    "There had surely been a\nfaint yet definite look of antagonism.",
    "Aloud he said Now that we know\nits taxine there ought to be some evidence to be got as to how it was\nobtained or prepared.",
    "Just so.",
    "Well go ahead Neele.",
    "By the way Mr Percival Fortescue is\nhere now.",
    "Ive had a word or two with him and hes waiting to see you.",
    "Weve located the other son too.",
    "Hes in Paris at the Bristol leaving\ntoday.",
    "Youll have him met at the airport I suppose\n\nYes sir.",
    "That was my idea...\n\n\fWell youd better see Percival Fortescue now.",
    "The A.C. chuckled.",
    "Percy Prim thats what he is.",
    "Mr Percival Fortescue was a neat fair man of thirty odd with pale hair\nand eyelashes and a slightly pedantic way of speech.",
    "This has been a terrible shock to me Inspector Neele as you can well\nimagine.",
    "It must have been Mr Fortescue said Inspector Neele.",
    "I can only say that my father was perfectly well when I left home the\nday before yesterday.",
    "This food poisoning or whatever it was must\nhave been very sudden\n\nIt was very sudden yes.",
    "But it wasnt food poisoning Mr Fortescue.",
    "Percival stared and frowned.",
    "No So thats why  he broke off.",
    "Your\n\nfather\n\nsaid\n\nInspector\n\nNeele\n\nwas\n\npoisoned\n\nby\n\nthe\n\nadministration of taxine.",
    "Taxine I never heard of it.",
    "Very few people have I should imagine.",
    "It is a poison that takes effect\nvery suddenly and drastically.",
    "The frown deepened.",
    "Are you telling me Inspector that my father was deliberately\npoisoned by someone\n\nIt would seem so yes sir.",
    "Thats terrible\n\nYes indeed Mr Fortescue.",
    "Percival murmured I understand now their attitude in the hospital their referring me here.",
    "He broke off.",
    "After a pause he went on The\nfuneral He spoke interrogatively.",
    "The inquest is fixed for tomorrow after the postmortem.",
    "The\nproceedings at the inquest will be purely formal and the inquest will be\nadjourned.",
    "I understand.",
    "That is usually the case\n\nYes sir.",
    "Nowadays.",
    "May I ask have you formed any ideas any suspicions of who could Really I  again he broke off.",
    "Its rather early days for that Mr Fortescue murmured Neele.",
    "Yes I suppose so.",
    "All the same it would be helpful to us Mr Fortescue if you could give\nus some idea of your fathers testamentary dispositions.",
    "Or perhaps\nyou could put me in touch with his solicitor.",
    "His solicitors are Billingsby Horsethorpe  Walters of Bedford\nSquare.",
    "As far as his Will goes I think I can more or less tell you its\nmain dispositions.",
    "If you will be kind enough to do so Mr Fortescue.",
    "Its a routine that\nhas to be gone through Im afraid.",
    "My father made a new Will on the occasion of his marriage two years\nago said Percival precisely.",
    "My father left the sum of 100000\npounds to his wife absolutely and 50000 pounds to my sister Elaine.",
    "I\nam his residuary legatee.",
    "I am already of course a partner in the\nfirm.",
    "There was no bequest to your brother Lancelot Fortescue\n\nNo there is an estrangement of long standing between my father and\nmy brother.",
    "Neele threw a sharp glance at him  but Percival seemed quite sure of\nhis statement.",
    "So as the Will stands said Inspector Neele the three people who\nstand to gain are Mrs Fortescue Miss Elaine Fortescue and yourself\n\nI dont think I shall be much of a gainer.",
    "Percival sighed.",
    "There are\ndeath duties you know.",
    "Inspector.",
    "And of late my father has been \n\n\fwell all I can say is highly injudicious in some of his financial\ndealings.",
    "You and your father have not seen eye to eye lately about the conduct\nof the business Inspector Neele threw out the question in a genial\nmanner.",
    "I put my point of view to him but alas  Percival shrugged his\nshoulders.",
    "Put it rather forcibly didnt you Neele inquired.",
    "In fact not to put\ntoo fine a point on it there was quite a row about it wasnt there\n\nI should hardly say that Inspector.",
    "A red flush of annoyance\nmounted to Percivals forehead.",
    "Perhaps the dispute you had was about some other matter then Mr\nFortescue.",
    "There was no dispute.",
    "Inspector.",
    "Quite sure of that Mr Fortescue Well no matter.",
    "Did I understand\nthat your father and brother are still estranged\n\nThat is so.",
    "Then perhaps you can tell me what this means\n\nNeele handed him the telephone message Mary Dove had jotted down.",
    "Percival read it and uttered an exclamation of surprise and annoyance.",
    "He seemed both incredulous and angry.",
    "I cant understand it I really cant.",
    "I can hardly believe it.",
    "It seems to be true though Mr Fortescue.",
    "Your brother is arriving\nfrom Paris today.",
    "But its extraordinary quite extraordinary.",
    "No I really cant\nunderstand it.",
    "Your father said nothing to you about it\n\nHe certainly did not.",
    "How outrageous of him.",
    "To go behind my back\nand send for Lance.",
    "Youve no idea I suppose why he did such a thing\n\nOf course I havent.",
    "Its all on a par with his behaviour lately  Crazy\nUnaccountable.",
    "Its got to be stopped  I \n\nPercival came to an abrupt stop.",
    "The colour ebbed away again from\nhis pale face.",
    "Id forgotten  he said.",
    "For the moment Id forgotten that my father\nwas dead \n\nInspector Neele shook his head sympathetically.",
    "Percival Fortescue prepared to take his departure  as he picked up\nhis hat he said\n\nCall upon me if there is anything I can do.",
    "But I suppose  he paused you will be coming down to Yewtree Lodge\n\nYes Mr Fortescue  Ive got a man in charge there now.",
    "Percival shuddered in a fastidious way.",
    "It will all be most unpleasant.",
    "To think such a thing should happen to\nus \n\nHe sighed and moved towards the door.",
    "I shall be at the office most of the day.",
    "There is a lot to be seen to\nhere.",
    "But I shall get down to Yewtree Lodge this evening.",
    "Quite so sir.",
    "Percival Fortescue went out.",
    "Percy Prim murmured Neele.",
    "Sergeant Hay who was sitting unobtrusively by the wall looked up and\nsaid Sir interrogatively.",
    "Then as Neele did not reply he asked What do you make of it all\nsir\n\n\fI dont know said Neele.",
    "He quoted softly Theyre all very\nunpleasant people.",
    "Sergeant Hay looked somewhat puzzled.",
    "Alice in Wonderland said Neele.",
    "Dont you know your Alice Hay\n\nIts a classic isnt it sir said Hay.",
    "Third Programme stuff.",
    "I dont\nlisten to the Third Programme.",
    "Chapter 10\n\nIt was about five minutes after leaving Le Bourget that Lance\nFortescue opened his copy of the Continental Daily Mail.",
    "A minute or\ntwo later he uttered a startled exclamation.",
    "Pat in the seat beside him\nturned her head inquiringly.",
    "Its the old man said Lance.",
    "Hes dead.",
    "Dead Your father\n\nYes he seems to have been taken suddenly ill at the office was taken\nto St Judes Hospital and died there soon after arrival.",
    "Darling Im so sorry.",
    "What was it a stroke\n\nI suppose so.",
    "Sounds like it.",
    "Did he ever have a stroke before\n\n\fNo.",
    "Not that I know of.",
    "I thought people never died from a first one.",
    "Poor old boy said Lance.",
    "I never thought I was particularly fond of\nhim but somehow now that hes dead...\n\nOf course you were fond of him.",
    "We havent all got your nice nature Pat.",
    "Oh well it looks as though my\nlucks out again doesnt it.",
    "Yes.",
    "Its odd that it should happen just now.",
    "Just when you were on\nthe point of coming home.",
    "He turned his head sharply towards her.",
    "Odd What do you mean by odd.",
    "Pat\n\nShe looked at him with slight surprise.",
    "Well a sort of coincidence.",
    "You mean that whatever I set out to do goes wrong\n\nNo darling I didnt mean that.",
    "But there is such a thing as a run of\nbad luck.",
    "Yes I suppose there is.",
    "Pat said again Im so sorry.",
    "When they arrived at Heath Row and were waiting to disembark from\nthe plane an official of the air company called out in a clear voice\n\nIs Mr Lancelot Fortescue aboard\n\nHere said Lance.",
    "Would you just step this way Mr Fortescue.",
    "Lance and Pat followed him out of the plane preceding the other\npassengers.",
    "As they passed a couple in the last seat they heard the\nman whisper to his wife\n\nWellknown smugglers I expect.",
    "Caught in the act.",
    "II\n\nIts fantastic said Lance.",
    "Quite fantastic.",
    "He stared across the\ntable at DetectiveInspector Neele.",
    "Inspector Neele nodded his head sympathetically.",
    "Taxine  yewberries  the whole thing seems like some kind of\nmelodrama.",
    "I dare say this sort of thing seems ordinary enough to you\nInspector.",
    "All in the days work.",
    "But poisoning in our family seems\nwildly farfetched.",
    "Youve no idea then at all asked Inspector Neele who might have\npoisoned your father\n\nGood lord no.",
    "I expect the old mans made a lot of enemies in\nbusiness lots of people whod like to skin him alive do him down\nfinancially  all that sort of thing.",
    "But poisoning Anyway I wouldnt be\nin the know.",
    "Ive been abroad for a good many years and have known\nvery little of whats going on at home.",
    "Thats really what I wanted to ask you about Mr Fortescue.",
    "I\nunderstand from your brother that there was an estrangement\nbetween you and your father which had lasted for many years.",
    "Would\nyou like to tell me the circumstances that led to your coming home at\nthis time\n\nCertainly Inspector.",
    "I heard from my father let me see it must be\nabout  yes six months ago now.",
    "It was soon after my marriage.",
    "My\nfather wrote and hinted that he would like to let bygones be bygones.",
    "He suggested that I should come home and enter the firm.",
    "He was\nrather vague in his terms and I wasnt really sure that I wanted to do\nwhat he asked.",
    "Anyway the upshot was that I came over to England\nlast  yes last August just about three months ago.",
    "I went down to see\nhim at Yewtree Lodge and he made me I must say a very\nadvantageous offer.",
    "I told him that Id have to think about it and Id\nhave to consult my wife.",
    "He quite understood that.",
    "I flew back to East\nAfrica talked it over with Pat.",
    "The upshot was that I decided to accept\nthe old boys offer.",
    "I had to wind up my affairs there but I agreed to do\nso before the end of last month.",
    "I told him I would wire to him the date\nof my actual arrival in England.",
    "Inspector Neele coughed.",
    "Your arrival back seems to have caused your brother some surprise.",
    "Lance gave a sudden grin.",
    "His rather attractive face lit up with the\nspirit of pure mischief.",
    "Dont believe old Percy knew a thing about it he said.",
    "He was away\non his holiday in Norway at the time.",
    "If you ask me the old man picked\nthat particular time on purpose.",
    "He was going behind Percys back.",
    "In\nfact Ive a very shrewd suspicion that my fathers offer to me was\nactuated by the fact that he had a blazing row with poor old Percy  or\nVal as he prefers to be called.",
    "Val I think had been more or less trying\nto run the old man.",
    "Well the old man would never stand for anything of\nthat kind.",
    "What the exact row was about I dont know but he was\nfurious.",
    "And I think he thought it a jolly good idea to get me there and\nthereby spike poor old Vals guns.",
    "For one thing he never liked Percys\nwife much and he was rather pleased in a snobbish kind of way with\nmy marriage.",
    "It would be just his idea of a good joke to get me home\nand suddenly confront Percy with the accomplished fact.",
    "How long were you at Yewtree Lodge on this occasion\n\nOh not more than an hour or two.",
    "He didnt ask me to stay the night.",
    "The whole idea Im sure was a kind of secret offensive behind Percys\nback.",
    "I dont think he even wanted the servants to report upon it.",
    "As I\nsay things were left that Id think it over talk about it to Pat and then\nwrite him my decision which I did.",
    "I wrote giving him the approximate\ndate of my arrival and I finally sent him a telegram yesterday from\nParis.",
    "Inspector Neele nodded.",
    "A telegram which surprised your brother very much.",
    "I bet it did.",
    "However as usual Percy wins.",
    "Ive arrived too late.",
    "Yes said Inspector Neele thoughtfully youve arrived too late.",
    "He\nwent on briskly On the occasion of your visit last August did you\nmeet any other members of the family\n\nMy stepmother was there at tea.",
    "You had not met her previously\n\nNo.",
    "He grinned suddenly.",
    "The old boy certainly knew how to pick\nthem.",
    "She must be thirty years younger than him at least.",
    "You will excuse my asking but did you resent your fathers\nremarriage or did your brother do so\n\nLance looked surprised.",
    "I certainly didnt and I shouldnt think Percy did either.",
    "After all our\nown mother died when we were about  oh ten twelve years old.",
    "What\nIm really surprised at is that the old man didnt marry again before.",
    "Inspector Neele murmured\n\n\fIt may be considered taking rather a risk to marry a woman very\nmuch younger than yourself.",
    "Did my dear brother say that to you It sounds rather like him.",
    "Percy\nis a great master of the art of insinuation.",
    "Is that the set up Inspector\nIs my stepmother suspected of poisoning my father\n\nInspector Neeles face became blank.",
    "Its early days to have any definite ideas about anything Mr\nFortescue he said pleasantly.",
    "Now may I ask you what your plans\nare\n\nPlans Lance considered.",
    "I shall have to make new plans I\nsuppose.",
    "Where is the family All down at Yewtree Lodge\n\nYes.",
    "Id better go down there straight away.",
    "He turned to his wife.",
    "Youd\nbetter go to an hotel Pat.",
    "She protested quickly.",
    "No no.",
    "Lance Ill come with you.",
    "No darling.",
    "But I want to.",
    "Really Id rather you didnt.",
    "Go and stay at the  oh its so long since I\nstayed in London  Barness.",
    "Barness Hotel used to be a nice quiet\nsort of place.",
    "Thats still going I suppose\n\n\fOh yes Mr Fortescue.",
    "Right Pat Ill settle you in there if theyve got a room then Ill go on\ndown to Yewtree Lodge.",
    "But why cant I come with you Lance\n\nLances face took suddenly a rather grim line.",
    "Frankly Pat Im not sure of my welcome.",
    "It was Father who invited\nme there but Fathers dead.",
    "I dont know who the place belongs to\nnow.",
    "Percy I suppose or perhaps Adele.",
    "Anyway Id like to see what\nreception I get before I bring you there.",
    "Besides \n\nBesides what\n\nI dont want to take you to a house where theres a poisoner at large.",
    "Oh what nonsense.",
    "Lance said firmly\n\nWhere youre concerned Pat Im taking no risks.",
    "Chapter 11\n\nMr Dubois was annoyed.",
    "He tore Adele Fortescues letter angrily\nacross and threw it into the wastepaper basket.",
    "Then with a sudden\n\n\fcaution he fished out the various pieces struck a match and watched\nthem burn to ashes.",
    "He muttered under his breath\n\nWhy have women got to be such damned fools Surely common\nprudence...",
    "But then Mr Dubois reflected gloomily women never had\nany prudence.",
    "Though he had profited by this lack many a time it\nannoyed him now.",
    "He himself had taken every precaution.",
    "If Mrs\nFortescue rang up they had instructions to say that he was out.",
    "Already Adele Fortescue had rung him up three times and now she\nhad written.",
    "On the whole writing was far worse.",
    "He reflected for a\nmoment or two then he went to the telephone.",
    "Can I speak to Mrs Fortescue please Yes Mr Dubois.",
    "A minute or\ntwo later he heard her voice.",
    "Vivian at last\n\nYes yes Adele but be careful.",
    "Where are you speaking from\n\nFrom the library.",
    "Sure nobodys listening in in the hall\n\nWhy should they\n\nWell you never know.",
    "Are the police still about the house\n\nNo theyve gone for the moment anyhow.",
    "Oh Vivian dear its been\nawful.",
    "Yes yes it must have Im sure.",
    "But look here Adele weve got to be\ncareful.",
    "Oh of course darling.",
    "Dont call me darling through the phone.",
    "It isnt safe.",
    "Arent you being a little bit panicky Vivian After all everybody says\ndarling nowadays.",
    "Yes yes thats true enough.",
    "But listen.",
    "Dont telephone to me and\ndont write.",
    "But Vivian \n\nIts just for the present you understand.",
    "We must be careful.",
    "Oh.",
    "All right.",
    "Her voice sounded offended.",
    "Adele listen.",
    "My letters to you.",
    "You did burn them didnt you\n\nThere was a momentary hesitation before Adele Fortescue said\n\nOf course.",
    "I told you I was going to do so.",
    "Thats all right then.",
    "Well Ill ring off now.",
    "Dont phone and dont write.",
    "Youll hear from me in good time.",
    "He put the receiver back in its hook.",
    "He stroked his cheek thoughtfully.",
    "He didnt like that moments hesitation.",
    "Had Adele burnt his letters\n\n\fWomen were all the same.",
    "They promised to burn things and then\ndidnt.",
    "Letters Mr Dubois thought to himself.",
    "Women always wanted you to\nwrite them letters.",
    "He himself tried to be careful but sometimes one\ncould not get out of it.",
    "What had he said exactly in the few letters he\nhad written to Adele Fortescue It was the usual sort of gup he\nthought gloomily.",
    "But were there any special words  special phrases\nthat the police could twist to make them say what they wanted them to\nsay He remembered the Edith Thompson case.",
    "His letters were\ninnocent enough he thought but he could not be sure.",
    "His uneasiness\ngrew.",
    "Even if Adele had not already burnt his letters would she have\nthe sense to burn them now Or had the police already got hold of\nthem Where did she keep them he wondered.",
    "Probably in that sittingroom of hers upstairs.",
    "That gimcrack little desk probably.",
    "Sham\nantique Louis XIV.",
    "She had said something to him once about there\nbeing a secret drawer in it.",
    "Secret drawer That would not fool the\npolice long.",
    "But there were no police about the house now.",
    "She had\nsaid so.",
    "They had been there that morning and now they had all gone\naway.",
    "Up to now they had probably been busy looking for possible sources of\npoison in the food.",
    "They would not he hoped have got round to a room\nby room search of the house.",
    "Perhaps they would have to ask\npermission or get a search warrant to do that.",
    "It was possible that if he\nacted now at once \n\nHe visualised the house clearly in his minds eye.",
    "It would be getting\ntowards dusk.",
    "Tea would be brought in either into the library or into\nthe drawingroom.",
    "Everyone would be assembled downstairs and the\n\n\fservants would be having tea in the servants hall.",
    "There would be no\none upstairs on the first floor.",
    "Easy to walk up through the garden\nskirting the yew hedges that provided such admirable cover.",
    "Then\nthere was the little door at the side on to the terrace.",
    "That was never\nlocked until just before bedtime.",
    "One could slip through there and\nchoosing ones moment slip upstairs.",
    "Vivian Dubois considered very carefully what it behove him to do next.",
    "If Fortescues death had been put down to a seizure or to a stroke as\nsurely it ought to have been the position would be very different.",
    "As it\nwas  Dubois murmured under his breath Better be safe than sorry.",
    "II\n\nMary Dove came slowly down the big staircase.",
    "She paused a moment\nat the window on the half landing from which she had seen Inspector\nNeele arrive on the preceding day.",
    "Now as she looked out in the\nfading light she noticed a mans figure just disappearing round the\nyew hedge.",
    "She wondered if it was Lancelot Fortescue the prodigal\nson.",
    "He had perhaps dismissed his car at the gate and was\nwandering round the garden recollecting old times there before\ntackling a possibly hostile family.",
    "Mary Dove felt rather sympathetic\ntowards Lance.",
    "A faint smile on her lips she went on downstairs.",
    "In\nthe hall she encountered Gladys who jumped nervously at the sight of\nher.",
    "Was that the telephone I heard just now Mary asked.",
    "Who was it\n\n\fOh that was a wrong number.",
    "Thought we were the laundry.",
    "Gladys\nsounded breathless and rather hurried.",
    "And before that it was Mr\nDubois.",
    "He wanted to speak to the mistress.",
    "I see.",
    "Mary went on across the hall.",
    "Turning her head she said Its teatime I think.",
    "Havent you brought it in yet\n\nGladys said I dont think its halfpast four yet is it miss\n\nIts twenty minutes to five.",
    "Bring it in now will you\n\nMary Dove went on into the library where Adele Fortescue sitting on\nthe sofa was staring at the fire picking with her fingers at a small lace\nhandkerchief.",
    "Adele said fretfully\n\nWheres tea\n\nMary Dove said Its just coming in.",
    "A log had fallen out of the fireplace and Mary Dove knelt down at the\ngrate and replaced it with the tongs adding another piece of wood and\na little coal.",
    "Gladys went out into the kitchen where Mrs Crump raised a red and\nwrathful face from the kitchen table where she was mixing pastry in a\nlarge bowl.",
    "The library bells been ringing and ringing.",
    "Time you took in the tea\nmy girl.",
    "All right all right Mrs Crump.",
    "What Ill say to Crump tonight muttered Mrs Crump.",
    "Ill tell him off.",
    "Gladys went on into the pantry.",
    "She had not cut any sandwiches.",
    "Well\nshe jolly well wasnt going to cut sandwiches.",
    "Theyd got plenty to eat\nwithout that hadnt they Two cakes biscuits and scones and honey.",
    "Fresh black market farm butter.",
    "Plenty without her bothering to cut\ntomato or foie gras sandwiches.",
    "Shed got other things to think about.",
    "Fair temper Mrs Crump was in all because Mr Crump had gone out\nthis afternoon.",
    "Well it was his day out wasnt it Quite right of him\nGladys thought.",
    "Mrs Crump called out from the kitchen\n\nThe kettles boiling its head off.",
    "Arent you ever going to make that\ntea\n\nComing.",
    "She jerked some tea without measuring it into the big silver pot\ncarried it into the kitchen and poured the boiling water on it.",
    "She\nadded the teapot and the kettle to the big silver tray and carried the\nwhole thing through to the library where she set it on the small table\nnear the sofa.",
    "She went back hurriedly for the other tray with the\neatables on it.",
    "She carried the latter as far as the hall when the sudden\njarring noise of the grandfather clock preparing itself to strike made\nher jump.",
    "In the library Adele Fortescue said querulously to Mary Dove.",
    "Where is everybody this afternoon\n\nI really dont know Mrs Fortescue.",
    "Miss Fortescue came in some time\nago.",
    "I think Mrs Percivals writing letters in her room.",
    "Adele said pettishly Writing letters writing letters.",
    "That woman never\nstops writing letters.",
    "Shes like all people of her class.",
    "She takes an\nabsolute delight in death and misfortune.",
    "Ghoulish thats what I call it.",
    "Absolutely ghoulish.",
    "Mary murmured tactfully Ill tell her that tea is ready.",
    "Going towards the door she drew back a little in the doorway as Elaine\nFortescue came into the room.",
    "Elaine said\n\nIts cold and dropped down by the fireplace rubbing her hands\nbefore the blaze.",
    "Mary stood for a moment in the hall.",
    "A large tray with cakes on it was\nstanding on one of the hall chests.",
    "Since it was getting dark in the hall\nMary switched on the light.",
    "As she did so she thought she heard\nJennifer Fortescue walking along the passage upstairs.",
    "Nobody\nhowever came down the stairs and Mary went up the staircase and\nalong the corridor.",
    "Percival Fortescue and his wife occupied a selfcontained suite in one\nwing of the house.",
    "Mary tapped on the sittingroom door.",
    "Mrs Percival\n\n\fliked you to tap on doors a fact which always roused Crumps scorn of\nher.",
    "Her voice said briskly\n\nCome in.",
    "Mary opened the door and murmured\n\nTea is just coming in Mrs Percival.",
    "She was rather surprised to see Jennifer Fortescue with her outdoor\nclothes on.",
    "She was just divesting herself of a long camelhair coat.",
    "I didnt know youd been out said Mary.",
    "Mrs Percival sounded slightly out of breath.",
    "Oh I was just in the garden thats all.",
    "Just getting a little air.",
    "Really\nthough it was too cold.",
    "I shall be glad to get down to the fire.",
    "The\ncentral heating here isnt as good as it might be.",
    "Somebody must\nspeak to the gardeners about it Miss Dove.",
    "Ill do so Mary promised.",
    "Jennifer Fortescue dropped her coat on a chair and followed Mary out\nof the room.",
    "She went down the Stairs ahead of Mary who drew back a\nlittle to give her precedence.",
    "In the hall rather to Marys surprise she\nnoticed the tray of eatables was still there.",
    "She was about to go out to\nthe pantry and call to Gladys when Adele Fortescue appeared in the\ndoor of the library saying in an irritable voice\n\n\fArent we ever going to have anything to eat for tea\n\nQuickly Mary picked up the tray and took it into the library disposing\nthe various things on low tables near the fireplace.",
    "She was carrying\nthe empty tray out to the hall again when the frontdoor bell rang.",
    "Setting down the tray Mary went to the door herself.",
    "If this was the\nprodigal son at last she was rather curious to see him.",
    "How unlike the\nrest of the Fortescues Mary thought as she opened the door and\nlooked up into the dark lean face and the faint quizzical twist of the\nmouth.",
    "She said quietly\n\nMr Lancelot Fortescue\n\nHimself.",
    "Mary peered beyond him.",
    "Your luggage\n\nIve paid off the taxi.",
    "This is all Ive got.",
    "He picked up a mediumsized zip bag.",
    "Some faint feeling of surprise in\nher mind Mary said\n\nOh you did come in a taxi.",
    "I thought perhaps youd walked up.",
    "And\nyour wife\n\nHis face set in a rather grim line.",
    "Lance said\n\nMy wife wont be coming.",

    "I see.",
    "Come this way will you Mr Fortescue.",
    "Everyone is in the\nlibrary having tea.",
    "She took him to the library door and left him there.",
    "She thought to\nherself that Lancelot Fortescue was a very attractive person.",
    "A second\nthought followed the first.",
    "Probably a great many other women thought\nso too.",
    "III\n\nLance\n\nElaine came hurrying forward towards him.",
    "She flung her arms round\nhis neck and hugged him with a schoolgirl abandon that Lance found\nquite surprising.",
    "Hallo.",
    "Here I am.",
    "He disengaged himself gently.",
    "This is Jennifer\n\nJennifer Fortescue looked at him with eager curiosity.",
    "Im afraid Vals been detained in town she said.",
    "Theres so much to\nsee to you know.",
    "All the arrangements to make and everything.",
    "Of\ncourse it all comes on Val.",
    "He has to see to everything.",
    "You can really\nhave no idea what were all going through.",
    "It must be terrible for you said Lance gravely.",
    "He turned to the woman on the sofa who was sitting with a piece of\nscone and honey in her hand quietly appraising him.",
    "Of course cried Jennifer you dont know Adele do you\n\nLance murmured Oh yes I do as he took Adele Fortescues hand in\nhis.",
    "As he looked down at her her eyelids fluttered.",
    "She set down the\nscone she was eating with her left hand and just touched the\narrangement of her hair.",
    "It was a feminine gesture.",
    "It marked her\nrecognition of the entry to the room of a personable man.",
    "She said in\nher thick soft voice\n\nSit down here on the sofa beside me Lance.",
    "She poured out a cup of\ntea for him.",
    "Im so glad youve come she went on.",
    "We badly need\nanother man in the house.",
    "Lance said\n\nYou must let me do everything I can to help.",
    "You know  but perhaps you dont know  weve had the police here.",
    "They think  they think  she broke off and cried out passionately Oh\nits awful Awful\n\nI know.",
    "Lance was grave and sympathetic.",
    "As a matter of fact they\nmet me at London Airport.",
    "The police met you\n\n\fYes.",
    "What did they say\n\nWell Lance was deprecating.",
    "They told me what had happened.",
    "He was poisoned said Adele thats what they think what they say.",
    "Not food poisoning.",
    "Real poisoning by someone.",
    "I believe I really do\nbelieve they think its one of us.",
    "Lance gave her a sudden quick smile.",
    "Thats their pigeon he said consolingly.",
    "Its no good our worrying.",
    "What a scrumptious tea Its a long time since Ive seen a good English\ntea.",
    "The others fell in with his mood soon enough.",
    "Adele said suddenly\n\nBut your wife  havent you got a wife Lance\n\nIve got a wife yes.",
    "Shes in London.",
    "But arent you  hadnt you better bring her down here\n\nPlenty of time to make plans said Lance.",
    "Pat  oh Pats quite all\nright where she is.",
    "Elaine said sharply\n\n\fYou dont mean  you dont think \n\nLance said quickly\n\nWhat a wonderful looking chocolate cake.",
    "I must have some.",
    "Cutting himself a slice he asked\n\nIs Aunt Effie alive still\n\nOh yes Lance.",
    "She wont come down and have meals with us or\nanything but shes quite well.",
    "Only shes getting very peculiar.",
    "She always was peculiar said Lance.",
    "I must go up and see her after\ntea.",
    "Jennifer Fortescue murmured\n\nAt her age one does really feel that she ought to be in some kind of\nhome.",
    "I mean somewhere where she will be properly looked after.",
    "Heaven help any old ladies home that got Aunt Effie in their midst\nsaid Lance.",
    "He added Whos the demure piece of goods who let me\nin\n\nAdele looked surprised.",
    "Didnt Crump let you in The butler Oh no I forgot.",
    "Its his day out\ntoday.",
    "But surely Gladys \n\n\fLance gave a description.",
    "Blue eyes hair parted in the middle soft\nvoice butter wouldnt melt in the mouth.",
    "What goes on behind it all I\nwouldnt like to say.",
    "That said Jennifer would be Mary Dove.",
    "Elaine said\n\nShe sort of runs things for us.",
    "Does she now\n\nAdele said\n\nShes really very useful.",
    "Yes said Lance thoughtfully I should think she might be.",
    "But what is so nice is said Jennifer that she knows her place.",
    "She\nnever presumes if you know what I mean.",
    "Clever Mary Dove said Lance and helped himself to another piece\nof chocolate cake.",
    "Chapter 12\n\nSo youve turned up again like a bad penny said Miss Ramsbottom.",
    "Lance grinned at her.",
    "Just as you say.",
    "Aunt Effie.",
    "Humph Miss Ramsbottom sniffed disapprovingly.",
    "Youve chosen a\nnice time to do it.",
    "Your father got himself murdered yesterday the\nhouse is full of police poking about everywhere grubbing in the\ndustbins even.",
    "Ive seen them out of the window.",
    "She paused sniffed\nagain and asked Got your wife with you\n\nNo.",
    "I left Pat in London.",
    "That shows some sense.",
    "I shouldnt bring her here if I were you.",
    "You\nnever know what might happen.",
    "To her To Pat\n\nTo anybody said Miss Ramsbottom.",
    "Lance Fortescue looked at her thoughtfully.",
    "Got any ideas about it all Aunt Effie he asked.",
    "Miss Ramsbottom did not reply directly.",
    "I had an Inspector here\nyesterday asking me questions.",
    "He didnt get much change out of me.",
    "But he wasnt such a fool as he looked not by a long way.",
    "She added\nwith some indignation What your grandfather would feel if he knew\nwe had the police in the house  its enough to make him turn in his\ngrave.",
    "A strict Plymouth Brother he was all his life.",
    "The fuss there was\nwhen he found out Id been attending Church of England services in\nthe evening And Im sure that was harmless enough compared to\nmurder.",
    "Normally Lance would have smiled at this but his long dark face\nremained serious.",
    "He said\n\nDyou know Im quite in the dark after having been away so long.",
    "Whats been going on here of late\n\nMiss Ramsbottom raised her eyes to heaven.",
    "Godless doings she said firmly.",
    "Yes yes Aunt Effie you would say that anyway.",
    "But what gives the\npolice the idea that Dad was killed here in this house\n\nAdultery is one thing and murder is another said Miss Ramsbottom.",
    "I shouldnt like to think it of her I shouldnt indeed.",
    "Lance looked alert.",
    "Adele he asked.",
    "My lips are sealed said Miss Ramsbottom.",
    "Come on old dear said Lance.",
    "Its a lovely phrase but it doesnt\nmean a thing.",
    "Adele had a boy friend Adele and the boy friend fed him\nhenbane in the morning tea.",
    "Is that the set up\n\nIll trouble you not to joke about it.",
    "I wasnt really joking you know.",
    "Ill tell you one thing said Miss Ramsbottom suddenly.",
    "I believe that\ngirl knows something about it.",
    "Which girl Lance looked surprised.",
    "The one that sniffs said Miss Ramsbottom.",
    "The one that ought to\nhave brought me up my tea this afternoon but didnt.",
    "Gone out without\nleave so they say.",
    "I shouldnt wonder if she had gone to the police.",
    "Who let you in\n\nSomeone called Mary Dove I understand.",
    "Very meek and mild  but\nnot really.",
    "Is she the one whos gone to the police\n\nShe wouldnt go to the police said Miss Ramsbottom.",
    "No  I mean\nthat silly little parlourmaid.",
    "Shes been twitching and jumping like a\nrabbit all day.",
    "Whats the matter with you I said.",
    "Have you got a\nguilty conscience She said I never did anything  I wouldnt do a\nthing like that.",
    "I hope you wouldnt I said to her but theres\nsomething worrying you now isnt there Then she began to sniff and\nsaid she didnt want to get anybody into trouble she was sure it must\nbe all a mistake.",
    "I said to her I said Now my girl you speak the truth\nand shame the devil.",
    "Thats what I said.",
    "You go to the police I said\nand tell them anything you know because no good ever came I said\nof hushing up the truth however unpleasant it is.",
    "Then she talked a\nlot of nonsense about she couldnt go to the police theyd never\nbelieve her and what on earth should she say She ended up by saying\nanyway she didnt know anything at all.",
    "You dont think Lance hesitated that she was just making herself\nimportant\n\n\fNo I dont.",
    "I think she was scared.",
    "I think she saw something or heard\nsomething thats given her some idea about the whole thing.",
    "It may be\nimportant or it maynt be of the least consequence.",
    "You dont think she herself couldve had a grudge against Father and  Lance hesitated.",
    "Miss Ramsbottom was shaking her head decidedly.",
    "Shes not the kind of girl your father would have taken the least notice\nof.",
    "No man ever will take much notice other poor girl.",
    "Ah well its all\nthe better for her soul that I dare say.",
    "Lance took no interest in Gladyss soul.",
    "He asked\n\nYou think she may have run along to the police station\n\nAunt Effie nodded vigorously.",
    "Yes.",
    "I think she maynt like tove said anything to them in this house in\ncase somebody overheard her.",
    "Lance asked Do you think she may have seen someone tampering\nwith the food\n\nAunt Effie threw him a sharp glance.",
    "Its possible isnt it she said.",
    "Yes I suppose so.",
    "Then he added apologetically The whole thing\nstill seems so wildly improbable.",
    "Like a detective story.",
    "Percivals wife is a hospital nurse said Miss Ramsbottom.",
    "The remark seemed so unconnected with what had gone before that\nLance looked at her in a puzzled fashion.",
    "Hospital nurses are used to handling drugs said Miss Ramsbottom.",
    "Lance looked doubtful.",
    "This stuff  taxine  is it ever used in medicine\n\nThey get it from yewberries I gather.",
    "Children eat yewberries\nsometimes said Miss Ramsbottom.",
    "Makes them very ill too.",
    "I\nremember a case when I was a child.",
    "It made a great impression on\nme.",
    "I never forgot it.",
    "Things you remember come in useful sometimes.",
    "Lance raised his head sharply and stared at her.",
    "Natural affection is one thing said Miss Ramsbottom and I hope\nIve got as much of it as anyone.",
    "But I wont stand for wickedness.",
    "Wickedness has to be destroyed.",
    "II\n\nWent off without a word to me said Mrs Crump raising her red\nwrathful face from the pastry she was now rolling out on the board.",

    "Adele did\nnot answer.",
    "Mary switched on the lights and went across to the window where she\npulled the curtains across.",
    "It was only then that she turned her head\nand saw the face of the woman who had sagged back against the\ncushions.",
    "A half eaten scone spread with honey was beside her and\nher tea cup was still half full.",

    "III\n\nWell demanded Inspector Neele impatiently.",
    "The doctor said promptly\n\n\fCyanide  potassium cyanide probably  in the tea.",
    "Cyanide muttered Neele.",
    "The doctor looked at him with slight curiosity.",
    "Youre taking this hard  any special reason \n\nShe was cast as a murderess said Neele.",
    "And she turns out to be a victim.",
    "Hm.",
    "Youll have to think again wont\nyou\n\nNeele nodded.",
    "His face was bitter and his jaw was grimly set.",
    "Poisoned Right under his nose.",

    "A last cup of tea Yes it had indeed been her last cup of tea.",
    "And after that a blank twenty minutes perhaps until Mary Dove had\ncome into the room and discovered the body.",
    "And during that twenty minutes \n\nInspector Neele swore to himself and went out into the kitchen.",
    "Sitting in a chair by the kitchen table the vast figure of Mrs Crump her\nbelligerence pricked like a balloon hardly stirred as he came in.",
    "Wheres that girl Has she come back yet\n\nGladys No  shes not back  Wont be I suspect until eleven\noclock.",
    "She made the tea you say and took it in.",
    "I didnt touch it sir as Gods my witness.",
    "And whats more I dont\nbelieve Gladys did anything she shouldnt.",
    "She wouldnt do a thing like\nthat  not Gladys.",
    "Shes a good enough girl sir  a bit foolish like thats\nall  not wicked.",
    "No Neele did not think that Gladys was wicked.",
    "He did not think that\nGladys was a poisoner.",
    "And in any case the cyanide had not been in\nthe teapot.",
    "But what made her go off suddenly  like this It wasnt her day out\nyou say.",
    "No sir tomorrows her day out.",
    "Does Crump \n\n\fMrs Crumps belligerence suddenly revived.",
    "Her voice rose wrathfully.",
    "Dont you go fastening anything on Crump.",
    "Crumps out of it.",
    "He went\noff at three oclock  and thankful I am now that he did.",
    "Hes as much\nout of it as Mr Percival himself.",
    "Percival Fortescue had only just returned from London  to be greeted\nby the astounding news of this second tragedy.",
    "I wasnt accusing Crump said Neele mildly.",
    "I just wondered if he\nknew anything about Gladyss plans.",
    "She had her best nylons on said Mrs Crump.",
    "She was up to\nsomething.",
    "Dont tell me Didnt cut any sandwiches for tea either.",
    "Oh\nyes she was up to something.",
    "Ill give her a piece of my mind when she\ncomes back.",
    "When she comes back \n\nA faint uneasiness possessed Neele.",
    "To shake it off he went upstairs to\nAdele Fortescues bedroom.",
    "A lavish apartment  all rose brocade\nhangings and a vast gilt bed.",
    "On one side of the room was a door into a\nmirror lined bathroom with a sunk orchid pink porcelain bath.",
    "Beyond\nthe bathroom reached by a communicating door was Rex Fortescues\ndressing room.",
    "Neele went back into Adeles bedroom and through\nthe door on the farther side of the room into her sittingroom.",
    "The room was furnished in Empire style with a rose pile carpet.",
    "Neele\nonly gave it a cursory glance for that particular room had had his close\n\n\fattention on the preceding day  with special attention paid to the small\nelegant desk.",
    "Now however he stiffened to sudden attention.",
    "On the centre of the\nrose pile carpet was a small piece of caked mud.",
    "Neele went over to it and picked it up.",
    "The mud was still damp.",
    "He looked round  there were no footprints visible  only this one\nisolated fragment of wet earth.",
    "IV\n\nInspector Neele looked round the bedroom that belonged to Gladys\nMartin.",
    "It was past eleven oclock  Crump had come in half an hour\nago  but there was still no sign of Gladys.",
    "Inspector Neele looked\nround him.",
    "Whatever Gladyss training had been her own natural\ninstincts were slovenly.",
    "The bed Inspector Neele judged was seldom\nmade the windows seldom opened.",
    "Gladyss personal habits\nhowever were not his immediate concern.",
    "Instead he went carefully\nthrough her possessions.",
    "They consisted for the most part of cheap and rather pathetic finery.",
    "There was little that was durable or of good quality.",
    "The elderly Ellen\nwhom he had called upon to assist him had not been helpful.",
    "She\ndidnt know what clothes Gladys had or hadnt.",
    "She couldnt say what\nif anything was missing.",
    "He turned from the clothes and the\nunderclothes to the contents of the chest of drawers.",
    "There Gladys\nkept her treasures.",
    "There were picture postcards and newspaper\n\n\fcuttings knitting patterns hints on beauty culture dressmaking and\nfashion advice.",
    "Inspector Neele sorted them neatly in various categories.",
    "The picture\npostcards consisted mainly of views of various places where he\npresumed Gladys had spent her holidays.",
    "Amongst them were three\npicture postcards signed Bert.",
    "Bert he took to be the young man\nreferred to by Mrs Crump.",
    "The first postcard said  in an illiterate hand\nAll the best.",
    "Missing you a lot.",
    "Yours ever Bert.",
    "The second said\nLots of nice looking girls here but not one thats a patch on you.",
    "Be\nseeing you soon.",
    "Dont forget our date.",
    "And remember after that  its\nthumbs up and living happy ever after.",
    "The third said merely Dont\nforget.",
    "Im trusting you.",
    "Love B.",
    "Next Neele looked through the newspaper cuttings and sorted them\ninto three piles.",
    "There were the dressmaking and beauty hints there\nwere items about cinema stars to which Gladys had appeared greatly\naddicted and she had also it appeared been attracted by the latest\nmarvels of science.",
    "There were cuttings about flying saucers about\nsecret weapons about truth drugs used by Russians and claims for\nfantastic drugs discovered by American doctors.",
    "All the witchcraft so\nNeele thought of our twentieth century.",
    "But in all the contents of the\nroom there was nothing to give him a clue to her disappearance.",
    "She\nhad kept no diary not that he had expected that.",
    "It was a remote\npossibility.",
    "There was no unfinished letter no record at all of anything\nshe might have seen in the house which could have had a bearing on\nRex Fortescues death.",
    "Whatever Gladys had seen whatever Gladys\nhad known there was no record of it.",
    "It would still have to be\nguesswork why the second tea tray had been left in the hall and\nGladys herself had so suddenly vanished.",
    "Sighing Neele left the room shutting the door behind him.",
    "As he prepared to descend the small winding stairs he heard a noise of\nrunning feet coming along the landing below.",
    "The agitated face of Sergeant Hay looked up at him from the bottom of\nthe stairs.",
    "Sergeant Hay was panting a little.",
    "Sir he said urgently.",
    "Sir Weve found her \n\nFound her\n\nIt was the housemaid sir  Ellen  remembered as she hadnt brought\nthe clothes in from where they were hanging on the line  just round the\ncorner from the back door.",
    "So she went out with a torch to take them\nin and she almost fell over the body  the girls body  strangled she\nwas with a stocking round her throat  been dead for hours Id say.",
    "And sir its a wicked kind of joke  there was a clothes peg clipped on\nher nose \n\nChapter 13\n\nAn elderly lady travelling by train had bought three morning papers\nand each of them as she finished it folded it and laid it aside showed\nthe same headline.",
    "It was no longer a question now of a small\nparagraph hidden away in the corner of the papers.",
    "There were\nheadlines with flaring announcements of Triple Tragedy at Yewtree\nLodge.",
    "The old lady sat very upright looking out of the window of the train\nher lips pursed together an expression of distress and disapproval on\nher pink and white wrinkled face.",
    "Miss Marple had left St Mary Mead by\nthe early train changing at the junction and going on to London where\nshe took a Circle train to another London terminus and thence on to\nBaydon Heath.",
    "At the station she signalled a taxi and asked to be taken to Yewtree\nLodge.",
    "So charming so innocent such a fluffy and pink and white old\nlady was Miss Marple that she gained admittance to what was now\npractically a fortress in a state of siege far more easily than could have\nbeen\n\nbelieved\n\npossible.",
    "Though\n\nan\n\narmy\n\nof\n\nreporters\n\nand\n\nphotographers were being kept at bay by the police Miss Marple was\nallowed to drive in without question so impossible would it have been\nto believe that she was anyone but an elderly relative of the family.",
    "Miss Marple paid off the taxi in a careful assortment of small change\nand rang the frontdoor bell.",
    "Crump opened it and Miss Marple\nsummed him up with an experienced glance.",
    "A shifty eye she said to\nherself.",
    "Scared to death too.",
    "Crump saw a tall elderly lady wearing an oldfashioned tweed coat\nand skirt a couple of scarves and a small felt hat with a birds wing.",
    "The old lady carried a capacious handbag and an aged but good\nquality suitcase reposed by her feet.",
    "Crump recognised a lady when\nhe saw one and said\n\nYes madam in his best and most respectful voice.",
    "Could I see the mistress of the house please said Miss Marple.",
    "Crump drew back to let her in.",
    "He picked up the suitcase and put it\ncarefully down in the hall.",
    "Well madam he said rather dubiously I dont know who exactly \n\nMiss Marple helped him out.",
    "I have come she said to speak about the poor girl who was killed.",
    "Gladys Martin.",
    "Oh I see madam.",
    "Well in that case  he broke off and looked\ntowards the library door from which a tall young woman had just\nemerged.",
    "This is Mrs Lance Fortescue madam he said.",
    "Pat came forward and she and Miss Marple looked at each other.",
    "Miss\nMarple was aware of a faint feeling of surprise.",
    "She had not expected\nto see someone like Patricia Fortescue in this particular house.",
    "Its\ninterior was much as she had pictured it but Pat did not somehow\nmatch with that interior.",
    "Its about Gladys madam said Crump helpfully.",
    "Pat said rather hesitatingly\n\nWill you come in here We shall be quite alone.",
    "She led the way into the library and Miss Marple followed her.",
    "There wasnt anyone specially you wanted to see was there said\nPat because perhaps I shant be much good.",
    "You see my husband\nand I only came back from Africa a few days ago.",
    "We dont really know\nanything much about the household.",
    "But I can fetch my sisterinlaw or\nmy brotherinlaws wife.",
    "Miss Marple looked at the girl and liked her.",
    "She liked her gravity and\nher simplicity.",
    "For some strange reason she felt sorry for her.",
    "A\nbackground of shabby chintz and horses and dogs.",
    "Miss Marple felt\nvaguely would have been much more suitable than this richly\nfurnished interior decor.",
    "At the pony show and gymkhanas held locally\nround St Mary Mead Miss Marple had met many Pats and knew them\nwell.",
    "She felt at home with this rather unhappy looking girl.",
    "Its very simple really said Miss Marple taking off her gloves\ncarefully and smoothing out the fingers of them.",
    "I read in the paper\nyou see about Gladys Martin having been killed.",
    "And of course I know\nall about her.",
    "She comes from my part of the country.",
    "I trained her in\nfact for domestic service.",
    "And since this terrible thing has happened\nto her I felt  well I felt that I ought to come and see if there was\nanything I could do about it.",
    "Yes said Pat.",
    "Of course.",
    "I see.",
    "And she did see.",
    "Miss Marples action appeared to her natural and\ninevitable.",
    "I think its a very good thing you have come said Pat.",
    "Nobody\nseems to know very much about her.",
    "I mean relations and all that.",
    "No said Miss Marple of course not.",
    "She hadnt got any relations.",
    "She came to me from the orphanage.",
    "St Faiths.",
    "A very well run place\nthough sadly short of funds.",
    "We do our best for the girls there try to\ngive them a good training and all that.",
    "Gladys came to me when she\nwas seventeen and I taught her how to wait at table and keep the silver\nand everything like that.",
    "Of course she didnt stay long.",
    "They never do.",
    "As soon as she got a little experience she went and took a job in a\ncaf\u00e9.",
    "The girls nearly always want to do that.",
    "They think its freer you\nknow and a gayer life.",
    "Perhaps it may be.",
    "I really dont know.",
    "I never even saw her said Pat.",
    "Was she a pretty girl\n\nOh no said Miss Marple not at all.",
    "Adenoids and a good many\nspots.",
    "She was rather pathetically stupid too.",
    "I dont suppose went\non Miss Marple thoughtfully that she ever made many friends\nanywhere.",
    "She was very keen on men poor girl.",
    "But men didnt take\nmuch notice of her and other girls rather made use of her.",
    "It sounds rather cruel said Pat.",
    "Yes my dear said Miss Marple life is cruel Im afraid.",
    "One doesnt\nreally know what to do with the Gladyses.",
    "They enjoy going to the\npictures and all that but theyre always thinking of impossible things\nthat cant possibly happen to them.",
    "Perhaps thats happiness of a kind.",
    "But they get disappointed.",
    "I think Gladys was disappointed in caf\u00e9 and\nrestaurant life.",
    "Nothing very glamorous or interesting happened to her\nand it was just hard on the feet.",
    "Probably thats why she came back\ninto private service.",
    "Do you know how long shed been here\n\nPat shook her head.",
    "Not very long I should think.",
    "Only a month or two.",
    "Pat paused and\nthen went on It seems so horrible and futile that she should have\nbeen caught up in this thing.",
    "I suppose shed seen something or\nnoticed something.",
    "It was the clothes peg that really worried me said Miss Marple in her\ngentle voice.",
    "The clothes peg\n\nYes.",
    "I read about it in the papers.",
    "I suppose it is true That when she\nwas found there was a clothes peg clipped on to her nose.",
    "Pat nodded.",
    "The colour rose to Miss Marples pink cheeks.",
    "Thats what made me so very angry if you can understand my dear.",
    "It was such a cruel contemptuous gesture.",
    "It gave me a kind of picture\nof the murderer.",
    "To do a thing like that Its very wicked you know to\naffront human dignity.",
    "Particularly if youve already killed.",
    "Pat said slowly\n\nI think I see what you mean.",
    "She got up.",
    "I think youd better come\nand see Inspector Neele.",
    "Hes in charge of the case and hes here now.",
    "Youll like him I think.",
    "Hes a very human person.",
    "She gave a sudden\nquick shiver.",
    "The whole thing is such a horrible nightmare.",
    "Pointless.",
    "Mad.",
    "Without rhyme or reason in it.",
    "I wouldnt say that you know said Miss Marple.",
    "No I wouldnt say\nthat.",
    "Inspector Neele was looking tired and haggard.",
    "Three deaths and the\npress of the whole country whooping down the trail.",
    "A case that\nseemed to be shaping in wellknown fashion had gone suddenly\nhaywire.",
    "Adele Fortescue that appropriate suspect was now the\nsecond victim of an incomprehensible murder case.",
    "At the close of\nthat fatal day the Assistant Commissioner had sent for Neele and the\ntwo men had talked far into the night.",
    "In spite of his dismay or rather behind it Inspector Neele had felt a\nfaint inward satisfaction.",
    "That pattern of the wife and the lover.",
    "It had\nbeen too slick too easy.",
    "He had always mistrusted it.",
    "And now that\nmistrust of his was justified.",
    "The whole thing takes on an entirely different aspect the A.C. had\nsaid striding up and down his room and frowning.",
    "It looks to me\nNeele as though wed got someone mentally unhinged to deal with.",
    "First the husband then the wife.",
    "But the very circumstances of the\ncase seem to show that its an inside job.",
    "Its all there in the family.",
    "Someone who sat down to breakfast with Fortescue put taxine in his\ncoffee or on his food someone who had tea with the family that day put\npotassium cyanide in Adele Fortescues cup of tea.",
    "Someone trusted\nunnoticed one of the family.",
    "Which of em Neele\n\nNeele said dryly\n\nPercival wasnt there so that lets him out again.",
    "That lets him out\nagain Inspector Neele repeated.",
    "The A.C. looked at him sharply.",
    "Something in the repetition had\nattracted his attention.",
    "Whats the idea Neele Out with it man.",
    "Inspector Neele looked stolid.",
    "Nothing sir.",
    "Not so much as an idea.",
    "All I say is it was very\nconvenient for him.",
    "A bit too convenient eh The A.C. reflected and shook his head.",
    "You think he might have managed it somehow Cant see how Neele.",
    "No I cant see how.",
    "He added And hes a cautious type too.",
    "But quite intelligent sir.",
    "You dont fancy the women.",
    "Is that it Yet the women are indicated.",
    "Elaine Fortescue and Percivals wife.",
    "They were at breakfast and they\nwere at tea that day.",
    "Either of them could have done it.",
    "No signs of\nanything abnormal about them Well it doesnt always show.",
    "There\nmight be something in their past medical record.",
    "Inspector Neele did not answer.",
    "He was thinking of Mary Dove.",
    "He had\nno definite reason for suspecting her but that was the way his\nthoughts\n\nlay.",
    "There\n\nwas\n\nsomething\n\nunexplained\n\nabout\n\nher\n\nunsatisfactory.",
    "A taint amused antagonism.",
    "That had been her\nattitude after the death of Rex Fortescue.",
    "What was her attitude now\n\n\fHer behaviour and manner were as always exemplary.",
    "There was no\nlonger he thought amusement.",
    "Perhaps not even antagonism but he\nwondered whether once or twice he had not seen a trace of fear.",
    "He\nhad been to blame culpably to blame in the matter of Gladys Martin.",
    "That guilty confusion of hers he had put down to no more than a\nnatural nervousness of the police.",
    "He had come across that guilty\nnervousness so often.",
    "In this case it had been something more.",
    "Gladys\nhad seen or heard something which had aroused her suspicions.",
    "It\nwas probably he thought some quite small thing something so vague\nand indefinite that she had hardly liked to speak about it.",
    "And now\npoor little rabbit she would never speak.",
    "Inspector Neele looked with some interest at the mild earnest face of\nthe old lady who confronted him now at Yewtree Lodge.",
    "He had been in\ntwo minds at first how to treat her but he quickly made up his mind.",
    "Miss\n\nMarple\n\nwould\n\nbe\n\nuseful\n\nto\n\nhim.",
    "She\n\nwas\n\nupright\n\nof\n\nunimpeachable rectitude and she had like most old ladies time on her\nhands and an old maids nose for scenting bits of gossip.",
    "Shed get\nthings out of servants and out of the women of the Fortescue family\nperhaps that he and his policemen would never get.",
    "Talk conjecture\nreminiscences repetitions of things said and done out of it all she\nwould pick the salient facts.",
    "So Inspector Neele was gracious.",
    "Its uncommonly good of you to have come here.",
    "Miss Marple he\nsaid.",
    "It was my duty.",
    "Inspector Neele.",
    "The girl had lived in my house.",
    "I feel\nin a sense responsible for her.",
    "She was a very silly girl you know.",
    "Inspector Neele looked at her appreciatively.",
    "Yes he said just so.",
    "She had gone he felt to the heart of the matter.",
    "She wouldnt know said Miss Marple what she ought to do.",
    "If I\nmean something came up.",
    "Oh dear Im expressing myself very\nbadly.",
    "Inspector Neele said that he understood.",
    "She hadnt got good judgment as to what was important or not thats\nwhat you mean isnt it\n\nOh yes exactly.",
    "Inspector.",
    "When you say that she was silly  Inspector Neele broke off.",
    "Miss Marple took up the theme.",
    "She was the credulous type.",
    "She was the sort of girl who would have\ngiven her savings to a swindler if shed had any savings.",
    "Of course\nshe never did have any savings because she always spent her money\non most unsuitable clothes.",
    "What about men asked the Inspector.",
    "She wanted a young man badly said Miss Marple.",
    "In fact thats\nreally I think why she left St Mary Mead.",
    "The competition there is very\nkeen.",
    "So few men.",
    "She did have hopes of the young man who delivered\n\n\fthe fish.",
    "Young Fred had a pleasant word for all the girls but of course\nhe didnt mean anything by it.",
    "That upset poor Gladys quite a lot.",
    "Still I\ngather she did get herself a young man in the end\n\nInspector Neele nodded.",
    "It seems so.",
    "Albert Evans I gather his name was.",
    "She seems to have\nmet him at some holiday camp.",
    "He didnt give her a ring or anything so\nmaybe she made it all up.",
    "He was a mining engineer so she told the\ncook.",
    "That seems most unlikely said Miss Marple but I dare say its what\nhe told her.",
    "As I say shed believe anything.",
    "You dont connect him\nwith this business at all\n\nInspector Neele shook his head.",
    "No.",
    "I dont think there are any complications of that kind.",
    "He never\nseems to have visited her.",
    "He sent her a postcard from time to time\nusually from a seaport  probably 4th Engineer on a boat on the Baltic\nrun.",
    "Well said Miss Marple Im glad she had her little romance.",
    "Since\nher life has been cut short in this way  She tightened her lips.",
    "You\nknow.",
    "Inspector it makes me very very angry.",
    "And she added as she\nhad said to Pat Fortescue Especially the clothes peg.",
    "That\nInspector was really wicked.",
    "Inspector Neele looked at her with interest.",
    "I know just what you mean.",
    "Miss Marple he said.",
    "Miss Marple coughed apologetically.",
    "I wonder  I suppose it would be great presumption on my part  if only\nI could assist you in my very humble and Im afraid very feminine way.",
    "This is a wicked murderer Inspector Neele and the wicked should not\ngo unpunished.",
    "Thats an unfashionable belief nowadays Miss Marple Inspector\nNeele said rather grimly.",
    "Not that I dont agree with you.",
    "There is an hotel near the station or theres the Golf Hotel said Miss\nMarple tentatively and I believe theres a Miss Ramsbottom in this\nhouse who is interested in foreign missions.",
    "Inspector Neele looked at Miss Marple appraisingly.",
    "Yes he said.",
    "Youve got something there maybe.",
    "I cant say that\nIve had great success with the lady.",
    "Its really very kind of you Inspector Neele said Miss Marple.",
    "Im so\nglad you dont think Im just a sensation hunter.",
    "Inspector Neele gave a sudden rather unexpected smile.",
    "He was\nthinking to himself that Miss Marple was very unlike the popular idea of\nan avenging fury.",
    "And yet he thought that was perhaps exactly what\nshe was.",
    "Newspapers said Miss Marple are often so sensational in their\naccounts.",
    "But hardly I fear as accurate as one might wish.",
    "She\nlooked inquiringly at Inspector Neele.",
    "If one could be sure of having\njust the sober facts.",
    "Theyre not particularly sober said Neele.",
    "Shorn of undue\nsensation theyre as follows.",
    "Mr Fortescue died in his office as a result\nof taxine poisoning.",
    "Taxine is obtained from the berries and leaves of\nyew trees.",
    "Very convenient Miss Marple said.",
    "Possibly said Inspector Neele but weve no evidence as to that.",
    "As\nyet that is.",
    "He stressed the point because it was here that he thought\nMiss Marple might be useful.",
    "If any brew or concoction of yewberries\nhad been made in the house.",
    "Miss Marple was quite likely to come\nupon traces of it.",
    "She was the sort of old pussy who would make\nhomemade liqueurs cordials and herb teas herself.",
    "She would know\nmethods of making and methods of disposal.",
    "And Mrs Fortescue\n\nMrs Fortescue had tea with the family in the library.",
    "The last person to\nleave the room and the tea table was Miss Elaine Fortescue her stepdaughter.",
    "She states that as she left the room Mrs Fortescue was\npouring herself out another cup of tea.",
    "Some twenty minutes or halfhour later Miss Dove who acts as housekeeper went in to remove the\nteatray.",
    "Mrs Fortescue was still sitting on the sofa dead.",
    "Beside her\nwas a tea cup a quarter full and in the dregs of it was potassium\ncyanide.",
    "Which is almost immediate in its action I believe said Miss Marple.",
    "Exactly.",
    "Such dangerous stuff murmured Miss Marple.",
    "One has it to take\nwasps nests but Im always very very careful.",
    "Youre quite right said Inspector Neele.",
    "There was a packet of it in\nthe gardeners shed here.",
    "Again very convenient said Miss Marple.",
    "She added Was Mrs\nFortescue eating anything\n\nOh yes.",
    "Theyd had quite a sumptuous tea.",
    "Cake I suppose Bread and butter Scones perhaps Jam Honey\n\nYes there was honey and scones chocolate cake and swiss roll and\nvarious other plates of things.",
    "He looked at her curiously.",
    "The\npotassium cyanide was in the tea.",
    "Miss Marple.",
    "Oh yes yes.",
    "I quite understand that.",
    "I was just getting the whole\npicture so to speak.",
    "Rather significant dont you think\n\nHe looked at her in a slightly puzzled fashion.",
    "Her cheeks were pink\nher eyes were bright.",
    "And the third death.",
    "Inspector Neele\n\n\fWell the facts there seem clear enough too.",
    "The girl Gladys took in\nthe teatray then she brought the next tray into the hall but left it\nthere.",
    "Shed been rather absentminded all the day apparently.",
    "After\nthat no one saw her.",
    "The cook Mrs Crump jumped to the conclusion\nthat the girl had gone out for the evening without telling anybody.",
    "She\nbased her belief I think on the fact that the girl was wearing a good\npair of nylon stockings and her best shoes.",
    "There however she was\nproved quite wrong.",
    "The girl had obviously remembered suddenly that\nshe had not taken in some clothes that were drying outside on the\nclothes line.",
    "She ran out to fetch them in had taken down half of them\napparently when somebody took her unawares by slipping a stocking\nround her neck and  well that was that.",
    "Someone from outside said Miss Marple.",
    "Perhaps said Inspector Neele.",
    "But perhaps someone from inside.",
    "Someone whod been waiting his or her opportunity to get the girl\nalone.",
    "The girl was upset nervous when we first questioned her but\nIm afraid we didnt quite appreciate the importance of that.",
    "Oh but how could you cried Miss Marple because people so often\ndo look guilty and embarrassed when they are questioned by the\npolice.",
    "Thats just it.",
    "But this time Miss Marple it was rather more than that.",
    "I\nthink the girl Gladys had seen someone performing some action that\nseemed to her needed explanation.",
    "It cant I think have been anything\nvery definite.",
    "Otherwise she would have spoken out.",
    "But I think she did\nbetray the fact to the person in question.",
    "That person realised that\nGladys was a danger.",
    "And so Gladys was strangled and a clothes peg clipped on her nose\nmurmured Miss Marple to herself.",
    "Yes thats a nasty touch.",
    "A nasty sneering sort of touch.",
    "Just a nasty\nbit of unnecessary bravado.",
    "Miss Marple shook her head.",
    "Hardly unnecessary.",
    "It does all make a pattern doesnt it\n\nInspector Neele looked at her curiously.",
    "I dont quite follow you.",
    "Miss Marple.",
    "What do you mean by a pattern\n\nMiss Marple immediately became flustered.",
    "Well I mean it does seem  I mean regarded as a sequence if you\nunderstand  well one cant get away from facts can one\n\nI dont think I quite understand.",
    "Well I mean  first we have Mr Fortescue.",
    "Rex Fortescue.",
    "Killed in his\noffice in the city.",
    "And then we have Mrs Fortescue sitting here in the\nlibrary and having tea.",
    "There were scones and honey.",
    "And then poor\nGladys with the clothes peg on her nose.",
    "Just to point the whole thing.",
    "That very charming Mrs Lance Fortescue said to me that there didnt\nseem to be any rhyme or reason in it but I couldnt agree with her\nbecause its the rhyme that strikes one isnt it\n\n\fInspector Neele said slowly I dont think \n\nMiss Marple went on quickly\n\nI expect youre about thirtyfive or thirtysix arent you Inspector\nNeele I think there was rather a reaction just then when you were a\nlittle boy I mean against nursery rhymes.",
    "But if one has been brought\nup on Mother Goose  I mean it is really highly significant isnt it What\nI wondered was Miss Marple paused then appearing to take her\ncourage in her hands went on bravely Of course it is great\nimpertinence I know on my part saying this sort of thing to you.",
    "Please say anything you like.",
    "Miss Marple.",
    "Well thats very kind of you.",
    "I shall.",
    "Though as I say I do it with the\nutmost diffidence because I know I am very old and rather muddle\nheaded and I dare say my idea is of no value at all.",
    "But what I mean to\nsay is have you gone into the question of blackbirds\n\nChapter 14\n\nFor about ten seconds Inspector Neele stared at Miss Marple with the\nutmost bewilderment.",
    "His first idea was that the old lady had gone off\nher head.",
    "Blackbirds he repeated.",
    "Miss Marple nodded her head vigorously.",
    "Yes she said and forthwith recited\n\n\fSing a song of sixpence a pocketful of rye\n\nFour and twenty blackbirds baked in a pie.",
    "When the pie was opened the birds began to sing.",
    "Wasnt that a dainty dish to set before the king\n\nThe king was in his counting house counting out his money\n\nThe queen was in the parlour eating bread and honey\n\nThe maid was in the garden hanging out the clothes\n\nWhen there came a little dickey bird and nipped off her nose.",
    "Good Lord Inspector Neele said.",
    "I mean it does fit said Miss Marple.",
    "It was rye in his pocket wasnt\nit One newspaper said so.",
    "The others just said cereal which might\nmean anything.",
    "Farmers Glory or Cornflakes  or even maize  but it\nwas rye\n\nInspector Neele nodded.",
    "There you are said Miss Marple triumphantly.",
    "Rex Fortescue.",
    "Rex\nmeans King.",
    "In his Counting House.",
    "And Mrs Fortescue the Queen in\nthe parlour eating bread and honey.",
    "And so of course the murderer\nhad to put that clothes peg on poor Gladyss nose.",
    "Inspector Neele said\n\nYou mean the whole set up is crazy\n\nWell one mustnt jump to conclusions but it is certainly very odd.",
    "But\nyou really must make inquiries about blackbirds.",
    "Because there must\nbe blackbirds\n\nIt was at this point that Sergeant Hay came into the room saying\nurgently Sir.",
    "He broke off at sight of Miss Marple.",
    "Inspector Neele recovering\nhimself said\n\nThank you.",
    "Miss Marple.",
    "Ill look into the matter.",
    "Since you are\ninterested in the girl perhaps you would care to look over the things\nfrom her room.",
    "Sergeant Hay will show you them presently.",
    "Miss Marple accepting her dismissal twittered her way out.",
    "Blackbirds murmured Inspector Neele to himself.",
    "Sergeant Hay stared.",
    "Yes Hay what is it\n\nSir said Sergeant Hay urgently again.",
    "Look at this.",
    "He produced an article wrapped in a somewhat grubby handkerchief.",
    "Found it in the shrubbery said Sergeant Hay.",
    "Could have been\nchucked there from one of the back windows.",
    "He tipped the object down on the desk in front of the Inspector who\nleaned forward and inspected it with rising excitement.",
    "The exhibit\nwas a nearly full pot of marmalade.",
    "The Inspector stared at it without speech.",
    "His face assumed a\npeculiarly wooden and stupid appearance.",
    "In actual fact this meant\nthat Inspector Neeles mind was racing once more round an imaginary\ntrack.",
    "A moving picture was enacting itself before the eyes of his mind.",
    "He saw a new pot of marmalade he saw hands carefully removing its\ncover he saw a small quantity of marmalade removed mixed with a\npreparation of taxine and replaced in the pot the top smoothed over\nand the lid carefully replaced.",
    "He broke off at this point to ask\nSergeant Hay\n\nThey dont take marmalade out of the pot and put into fancy pots\n\nNo sir.",
    "Got into the way of serving it in its own pot during the war\nwhen things were scarce and its gone on like that ever since.",
    "Neele murmured\n\nThat made it easier of course.",
    "Whats more said Sergeant Hay Mr Fortescue was the only one\nthat took marmalade for breakfast and Mr Percival when he was at\nhome.",
    "The others had jam or honey.",
    "Neele nodded.",
    "Yes he said.",
    "That made it very simple didnt it\n\nAfter a slight gap the moving picture went on in his mind.",
    "It was the\nbreakfast table now.",
    "Rex Fortescue stretching out his hand for the\nmarmalade pot taking out a spoonful of marmalade and spreading it\non his toast and butter.",
    "Easier far easier that way than the risk and\ndifficulty of insinuating it into his coffee cup.",
    "A foolproof method of\nadministering the poison And afterwards Another gap and a picture\nthat was not quite so clear.",
    "The replacing of that pot of marmalade by\nanother with exactly the same amount taken from it.",
    "And then an open\nwindow.",
    "A hand and an arm flinging out that pot into the shrubbery.",
    "Whose hand and arm\n\nInspector Neele said in a businesslike voice\n\nWell well have of course to get this analysed.",
    "See if there are any\ntraces of taxine.",
    "We cant jump to conclusions.",
    "No sir.",
    "There may be fingerprints too.",
    "Probably not the ones we want said Inspector Neele gloomily.",
    "Therell be Gladyss of course and Crumps and Fortescues own.",
    "Then probably Mrs Crumps the grocers assistant and a few others If\nanyone put taxine in here theyd take care not to go playing about with\ntheir own fingers all over the pot.",
    "Anyway as I say we mustnt jump to\nconclusions.",
    "How do they order marmalade and where is it kept\n\n\fThe industrious Sergeant Hay had his answers pat for all these\nquestions.",
    "Marmalade and jams come in in batches of six at a time.",
    "A new pot\nwould be taken into the pantry when the old one was getting low.",
    "That means said Neele that it could have been tampered with\nseveral days before it was actually brought on to the breakfast table.",
    "And anyone who was in the house or had access to the house could\nhave tampered with it.",
    "The term access to the house puzzled Sergeant Hay slightly.",
    "He did\nnot see in what way his superiors mind was working.",
    "But Neele was postulating what seemed to him a logical assumption.",
    "If the marmalade had been tampered with beforehand  then surely\nthat ruled out those persons who were actually at the breakfast table\non the fatal morning.",
    "Which opened up some interesting new possibilities.",
    "He planned in his mind interviews with various people  this time with\nrather a different angle of approach.",
    "Hed keep an open mind...\n\nHed\n\neven\n\nconsider\n\nseriously\n\nthat\n\nold\n\nMiss\n\nWhatshernames\n\nsuggestions about the nursery rhyme.",
    "Because there was no doubt\n\n\fthat that nursery rhyme fitted in a rather startling way.",
    "It fitted with a\npoint that had worried him from the beginning.",
    "The pocketful of rye.",
    "Blackbirds murmured Inspector Neele to himself.",
    "Sergeant Hay stared.",
    "Its not blackberry jelly sir he said.",
    "Its marmalade.",
    "II\n\nInspector Neele went in search of Mary Dove.",
    "He found her in one of the bedrooms on the first floor superintending\nEllen who was denuding the bed of what seemed to be clean sheets.",
    "A\nlittle pile of clean towels lay on a chair.",
    "Inspector Neele looked puzzled.",
    "Somebody coming to stay he asked.",
    "Mary Dove smiled at him.",
    "In contrast to Ellen who looked grim and\ntruculent Mary was her usual imperturbable self.",
    "Actually she said the opposite is the case.",
    "Neele looked inquiringly at her.",
    "This is the guest room we had prepared for Mr Gerald Wright.",
    "Gerald Wright Who is he\n\nHes a friend of Miss Elaine Fortescues.",
    "Marys voice was carefully\ndevoid of inflection.",
    "He was coming here  when\n\nI believe he arrived at the Golf Hotel the day after Mr Fortescues\ndeath.",
    "The day after.",
    "So Miss Fortescue said.",
    "Marys voice was still impersonal She told\nme she wanted him to come and stay in the house  so I had a room\nprepared.",
    "Now  after these other two  tragedies  it seems more\nsuitable that he should remain at the hotel.",
    "The Golf Hotel\n\nYes.",
    "Quite said Inspector Neele.",
    "Ellen gathered up the sheets and towels and went out of the room.",
    "Mary Dove looked inquiringly at Neele.",
    "You wanted to see me about something\n\nNeele said pleasantly\n\n\fIts becoming important to get exact times very clearly stated.",
    "Members of the family all seem a little vague about time  perhaps\nunderstandably.",
    "You on the other hand Miss Dove I have found\nextremely accurate in your statements as to times.",
    "Again understandably\n\nYes  perhaps  I must certainly congratulate you on the way you have\nkept this house going in spite of the  well panic  these last deaths\nmust have caused.",
    "He paused and then asked curiously How did\nyou do it\n\nHe had realised astutely that the one chink in the armour of Mary\nDoves inscrutability was her pleasure in her own efficiency.",
    "She\nunbent slightly now as she answered.",
    "The Crumps wanted to leave at once of course.",
    "We couldnt have allowed that.",
    "I know.",
    "But I also told them that Mr Percival Fortescue would be more\nlikely to be  well  generous  to those who had spared him\ninconvenience.",
    "And Ellen\n\nEllen does not wish to leave.",
    "Ellen does not wish to leave Neele repeated.",
    "She has good\nnerves.",
    "She enjoys disasters said Mary Dove.",
    "Like Mrs Percival she finds\nin disaster a kind of pleasurable drama.",
    "Interesting.",
    "Do you think Mrs Percival has  enjoyed the tragedies\n\nNo  of course not.",
    "That is going too far.",
    "I would merely say that it has\nenabled her to  well  stand up to them \n\nAnd how have you yourself been affected Miss Dove\n\nMary Dove shrugged her shoulders.",
    "It has not been a pleasant experience she said dryly.",
    "Inspector Neele felt again a longing to break down this cool young\nwomans defences  to find out what was really going on behind the\ncareful and efficient understatement of her whole attitude.",
    "He merely said brusquely\n\nNow  to recapitulate times and places the last time you saw Gladys\nMartin was in the hall before tea and that was at twenty minutes to\nfive\n\nYes  I told her to bring in tea.",
    "You yourself were coming from where\n\n\fFrom upstairs  I thought I had heard the telephone a few minutes\nbefore.",
    "Gladys presumably had answered the telephone\n\nYes.",
    "It was a wrong number.",
    "Someone who wanted the Baydon Heath\nLaundry.",
    "And that was the last time you saw her\n\nShe brought the teatray into the library about ten minutes or so\nlater.",
    "After that Miss Elaine Fortescue came in\n\nYes about three or four minutes later.",
    "Then I went up to tell Mrs\nPercival tea was ready.",
    "Did you usually do that\n\nOh no  people came in to tea when they pleased  but Mrs Fortescue\nasked where everybody was.",
    "I thought I heard Mrs Percival coming but that was a mistake \n\nNeele interrupted.",
    "Here was something new.",
    "You mean you heard someone upstairs moving about\n\n\fYes  at the head of the stairs I thought.",
    "But no one came down so I\nwent up.",
    "Mrs Percival was in her bedroom.",
    "She had just come in.",
    "She\nhad been out for a walk \n\nOut for a walk  I see.",
    "The time being then \n\nOh  nearly five oclock I think \n\nAnd Mr Lancelot Fortescue arrived  when\n\nA few minutes after I came downstairs again  I thought he had\narrived earlier  but \n\nInspector Neele interrupted\n\nWhy did you think he had arrived earlier\n\nBecause I thought I had caught sight of him through the landing\nwindow.",
    "In the garden you mean\n\nYes  I caught a glimpse of someone through the yew hedge  and I\nthought it would probably be him.",
    "This was when you were coming down after telling Mrs Percival\nFortescue tea was ready\n\nMary corrected him.",
    "No  not then  it was earlier  when I came down the first time.",
    "Inspector Neele stared.",
    "Are you sure about that.",
    "Miss Dove\n\nYes Im perfectly sure.",
    "Thats why I was surprised to see him  when\nhe actually did ring the bell.",
    "Inspector Neele shook his head.",
    "He kept his inner excitement out of his\nvoice as he said\n\nIt couldnt have been Lancelot Fortescue you saw in the garden.",
    "His\ntrain  which was due at 428 was nine minutes late.",
    "He arrived at\nBaydon Heath Station at 437.",
    "He had to wait a few minutes for a taxi that train is always very full.",
    "It was actually nearly a quarter to five five\nminutes after you had seen the man in the garden when he left the\nstation and it is a tenminute drive.",
    "He paid off the taxi at the gate here\nat about five minutes to five at the earliest.",
    "No  it wasnt Lancelot\nFortescue you saw.",
    "Im sure I did see someone.",
    "Yes you saw someone.",
    "It was getting dark.",
    "You couldnt have seen\nthe man clearly\n\nOh no  I couldnt see his face or anything like that  just his build  tall\nand slender.",
    "We were expecting Lancelot Fortescue  so I jumped to\nthe conclusion that thats who it was.",
    "He was going  which way\n\nAlong behind the yew hedge towards the east side of the house.",
    "There is a side door there.",
    "Is it kept locked\n\nNot until the house is locked up for the night.",
    "Anyone could have come in by that side door without being observed\nby any of the household.",
    "Mary Dove considered.",
    "I think so.",
    "Yes.",
    "She added quickly You mean  the person I heard\nlater upstairs could have come in that way Could have been hiding upstairs\n\nSomething of the kind.",
    "But who \n\nThat remains to be seen.",
    "Thank you Miss Dove.",
    "As she turned to go away Inspector Neele said in a casual voice By\nthe way you cant tell me anything about blackbirds I suppose\n\nFor the first time so it seemed Mary Dove was taken aback.",
    "She\nturned back sharply.",
    "I  what did you say\n\n\fI was just asking you about blackbirds.",
    "Do you mean \n\nBlackbirds said Inspector Neele.",
    "He had on his most stupid expression.",
    "You mean that silly business last summer But surely that cant...\nShe broke off.",
    "Inspector Neele said pleasantly\n\nTheres been a bit of talk about it but I was sure Id get a clear\naccount from you.",
    "Mary Dove was her calm practical self again.",
    "It must I think have been some silly spiteful joke she said.",
    "Four\ndead blackbirds were on Mr Fortescues desk in his study here.",
    "It was\nsummer and the windows were open and we rather thought it must\nhave been the gardeners boy though he insisted hed never done\nanything of the kind.",
    "But they were actually blackbirds the gardener\nhad shot which had been hanging up by the fruit bushes.",
    "And somebody had cut them down and put them on Mr Fortescues\ndesk\n\nYes.",
    "Any sort of reason behind it  any association with blackbirds\n\nMary shook her head.",
    "I dont think so.",
    "How did Mr Fortescue take it Was he annoyed\n\nNaturally he was annoyed.",
    "But not upset in any way\n\nI really cant remember.",
    "I see said Inspector Neele.",
    "He said no more.",
    "Mary Dove once more turned away but this time he\nthought she went rather unwillingly as though she would have liked to\nknow more of what was in his mind.",
    "Ungratefully all that Inspector\nNeele felt was annoyance with Miss Marple.",
    "She had suggested to him\nthat there would be blackbirds and sure enough there the blackbirds\nwere Not four and twenty of them that was true.",
    "What might be called\na token consignment.",
    "That had been as long ago as last summer and where it fitted in\nInspector Neele could not imagine.",
    "He was not going to let this\nblackbird bogey divert him from the logical and sober investigation of\nmurder by a sane murderer for a sane reason but he would be forced\nfrom now on to keep the crazier possibilities of the case in mind.",
    "Chapter 15\n\nIm sorry Miss Fortescue to bother you again but I want to be quite\nquite clear about this.",
    "As far as we know you were the last person  or\nrather the last person but one  to see Mrs Fortescue alive.",
    "It was\nabout twentypast five when you left the drawingroom\n\nAbout then said Elaine I cant say exactly.",
    "She added defensively.",
    "One doesnt look at clocks the whole time.",
    "No of course not.",
    "During the time that you were alone with Mrs\nFortescue after the others had left what did you talk about\n\nDoes it matter what we talked about\n\nProbably not said Inspector Neele but it might give me some clue\nas to what was in Mrs Fortescues mind.",
    "You mean  you think she might have done it herself\n\nInspector Neele noticed the brightening on her face.",
    "It would certainly\nbe a very convenient solution as far as the family was concerned.",
    "Inspector Neele did not think it was true for a moment.",
    "Adele\nFortescue was not to his mind a suicidal type.",
    "Even if she had poisoned\nher husband and was convinced the crime was about to be brought\nhome to her she would not he thought have ever thought of killing\nherself.",
    "She would have been sure optimistically that even if she were\ntried for murder she would be sure to be acquitted.",
    "He was not\n\n\fhowever averse to Elaine Fortescues entertaining the hypothesis.",
    "He\nsaid therefore quite truthfully\n\nTheres a possibility of it at least Miss Fortescue.",
    "Now perhaps youll\ntell me just what your conversation was about\n\nWell it was really about my affairs.",
    "Elaine hesitated.",
    "Your affairs being... he paused questioningly with a genial\nexpression.",
    "I  a friend of mine had just arrived in the neighbourhood and I was\nasking Adele if she would have any objection to  to my asking him to\nstay here at the house.",
    "Ah.",
    "And who is this friend\n\nIts a Mr Gerald Wright.",
    "Hes a schoolmaster.",
    "He  hes staying at the\nGolf Hotel.",
    "A very close friend perhaps\n\nInspector Neele gave an avuncular beam which added at least fifteen\nyears to his age.",
    "We may expect an interesting announcement shortly perhaps\n\nHe felt almost compunction as he saw the awkward gesture of the\ngirls hand and the flush on her face.",
    "She was in love with the fellow all\nright.",
    "We  were not actually engaged and of course we couldnt have it\nannounced just now but  well yes I think we do  I mean we are going\nto get married.",
    "Congratulations said Inspector Neele pleasantly.",
    "Mr Wright is\nstaying at the Golf Hotel you say How long has he been there\n\nI wired him when Father died.",
    "And he came at once.",
    "I see said Inspector Neele.",
    "He used this favourite phrase of his in a friendly and reassuring way.",
    "What did Mrs Fortescue say when you asked her about his coming\nhere\n\nOh she said all right I could have anybody I pleased.",
    "She was nice about it then\n\nNot exactly nice.",
    "I mean she said \n\nYes what else did she say\n\nAgain Elaine flushed.",
    "Oh something stupid about my being able to do a lot better for myself\nnow.",
    "It was the sort of thing Adele would say.",
    "Ah well said Inspector Neele soothingly relations say these sort of\nthings.",
    "Yes yes they do.",
    "But people often find it difficult to  to appreciate\nGerald properly.",
    "Hes an intellectual you see and hes got a lot of\nunconventional and progressive ideas that people dont like.",
    "Thats why he didnt get on with your father\n\nElaine flushed hotly.",
    "Father was very prejudiced and unjust.",
    "He hurt Geralds feelings.",
    "In\nfact Gerald was so upset by my fathers attitude that he went off and I\ndidnt hear from him for weeks.",
    "And probably wouldnt have heard from him now if your father hadnt\ndied and left you a packet of money Inspector Neele thought.",
    "Aloud he\nsaid\n\nWas there any more conversation between you and Mrs Fortescue\n\nNo.",
    "No I dont think so.",
    "And that was about twentyfivepast five and Mrs Fortescue was\nfound dead at five minutes to six.",
    "You didnt return to the room during\nthat halfhour\n\nNo.",
    "What were you doing\n\n\fI  I went out for a short walk.",
    "To the Golf Hotel\n\nI  well yes but Gerald wasnt in.",
    "Inspector Neele said I see again but this time with a rather\ndismissive effect.",
    "Elaine Fortescue got up and said\n\nIs that all\n\nThats all thank you.",
    "Miss Fortescue.",
    "As she got up to go Neele said casually\n\nYou cant tell me anything about blackbirds can you\n\nShe stared at him.",
    "Blackbirds You mean the ones in the pie\n\nThey would be in the pie the Inspector thought to himself.",
    "He merely\nsaid When was this\n\nOh Three or four months ago  and there were some on Fathers\ndesk too.",
    "He was furious \n\nFurious was he Did he ask a lot of questions\n\n\fYes  of course  but we couldnt find out who put them there.",
    "Have you any idea why he was so angry\n\nWell  it was rather a horrid thing to do wasnt it\n\nNeele looked thoughtfully at her  but he did not see any signs of\nevasion in her face.",
    "He said\n\nOh just one more thing.",
    "Miss Fortescue.",
    "Do you know if your\nstepmother made a will at any time\n\nElaine shook her head.",
    "Ive no idea  I  suppose so.",
    "People usually do dont they\n\nThey should do  but it doesnt always follow.",
    "Have you made a will\nyourself Miss Fortescue\n\nNo  no  I havent  up to now I havent had anything to leave  now of\ncourse \n\nHe saw the realisation of the changed position come into her eyes.",
    "Yes he said.",
    "Fifty thousand pounds is quite a responsibility  it\nchanges a lot of things Miss Fortescue.",
    "II\n\n\fFor some minutes after Elaine Fortescue left the room.",
    "Inspector\nNeele sat staring in front of him thoughtfully.",
    "He had indeed new food\nfor thought.",
    "Mary Doves statement that she had seen a man in the\ngarden at approximately 435 opened up certain new possibilities.",
    "That is of course if Mary Dove was speaking the truth.",
    "It was never\nInspector Neeles habit to assume that anyone was speaking the truth.",
    "But examine her statement as he might he could see no real reason\nwhy she should have lied.",
    "He was inclined to think that Mary Dove was\nspeaking the truth when she spoke of having seen a man in the garden.",
    "It was quite clear that that man could not have been Lancelot\nFortescue although her reason for assuming that it was he was quite\nnatural under the circumstances.",
    "It had not been Lancelot Fortescue\nbut it had been a man about the height and build of Lancelot\nFortescue and if there had been a man in the garden at that particular\ntime moreover a man moving furtively as it seemed to judge from the\nway he had crept behind the yew hedges then that certainly opened\nup a line of thought.",
    "Added to this statement of hers there had been the further statement\nthat she had heard someone moving about upstairs.",
    "That in its turn\ntied up with something else.",
    "The small piece of mud he had found on\nthe floor of Adele Fortescues boudoir.",
    "Inspector Neeles mind dwelt\non the small dainty desk in that room.",
    "Pretty little sham antique with a\nrather obvious secret drawer in it.",
    "There had been three letters in that\ndrawer letters written by Vivian Dubois to Adele Fortescue.",
    "A great\nmany love letters of one kind or another had passed through Inspector\nNeeles hands in the course of his career.",
    "He was acquainted with\npassionate letters foolish letters sentimental letters and nagging\nletters.",
    "There had also been cautious letters.",
    "Inspector Neele was\ninclined to classify these three as of the latter kind.",
    "Even if read in the\n\n\fdivorce court they could pass as inspired by a merely platonic\nfriendship.",
    "Though in this case Platonic friendship my foot thought\nthe Inspector inelegantly.",
    "Neele when he had found the letters had\nsent them up at once to the Yard since at that time the main question\nwas whether the Public Prosecutors office thought that there was\nsufficient evidence to proceed with the case against Adele Fortescue\nor Adele Fortescue and Vivian Dubois together.",
    "Everything had\npointed towards Rex Fortescue having been poisoned by his wife with\nor without her lovers connivance.",
    "These letters though cautious\nmade it fairly clear that Vivian Dubois was her lover but there had not\nbeen in the wording so far as Inspector Neele could see any signs of\nincitement to crime.",
    "There might have been incitement of a spoken\nkind but Vivian Dubois would be far too cautious to put anything of\nthat kind down on paper.",
    "Inspector Neele surmised accurately that Vivian Dubois had asked\nAdele Fortescue to destroy his letters and that Adele Fortescue had\ntold him she had done so.",
    "Well now they had two more deaths on their hands.",
    "And that meant or\nshould mean that Adele Fortescue had not killed her husband.",
    "Unless that is  Inspector Neele considered a new hypothesis  Adele\nFortescue had wanted to marry Vivian Dubois and Vivian Dubois had\nwanted not Adele Fortescue but Adele Fortescues hundred thousand\npounds which would come to her on the death of her husband.",
    "He had\nassumed perhaps that Rex Fortescues death would be put down to\nnatural causes.",
    "Some kind of seizure or stroke.",
    "After all everybody\nseemed to be worried over Rex Fortescues health during the last year.",
    "Parenthetically Inspector Neele said to himself that he must look into\n\n\fthat question.",
    "He had a subconscious feeling that it might be important\nin some way.",
    "To continue Rex Fortescues death had not gone\naccording to plan.",
    "It had been diagnosed without loss of time as\npoisoning and the correct poison named.",
    "Supposing that Adele Fortescue and Vivian Dubois had been guilty\nwhat state would they be in then Vivian Dubois would have been\nscared and Adele Fortescue would have lost her head.",
    "She might have\ndone or said foolish things.",
    "She might have rung up Dubois on the\ntelephone talking indiscreetly in a way that he would have realised\nmight have been overheard in Yewtree Lodge.",
    "What would Vivian\nDubois have done next\n\nIt was early as yet to try and answer that question but Inspector Neele\nproposed very shortly to make inquiries at the Golf Hotel as to whether\nDubois had been in or out of the hotel between the hours of 415 and 6\noclock.",
    "Vivian Dubois was tall and dark like Lance Fortescue.",
    "He\nmight have slipped through the garden to the side door made his way\nupstairs and then what Looked for the letters and found them gone\nWaited there perhaps till the coast was clear then come down into\nthe library when tea was over and Adele Fortescue was alone\n\nBut all this was going too fast \n\nNeele had questioned Mary Dove and Elaine Fortescue he must see\nnow what Percival Fortescues wife had to say.",
    "Chapter 16\n\n\fInspector Neele found Mrs Percival in her own sittingroom upstairs\nwriting letters.",
    "She got up rather nervously when he came in.",
    "Is there anything  what  are there \n\nPlease sit down Mrs Fortescue.",
    "There are only just a few more\nquestions I would like to ask you.",
    "Oh yes.",
    "Yes of course.",
    "Inspector.",
    "Its all so dreadful isnt it So very\ndreadful.",
    "She sat down rather nervously in an armchair.",
    "Inspector Neele sat\ndown in the small straight chair near her.",
    "He studied her rather more\ncarefully than he had done heretofore.",
    "In some ways a mediocre type\nof woman he thought  and thought also that she was not very happy.",
    "Restless unsatisfied limited in mental outlook yet he thought she\nmight have been efficient and skilled in her own profession of hospital\nnurse.",
    "Though she had achieved leisure by her marriage with a welltodo man leisure had not satisfied her.",
    "She bought clothes read novels\nand ate sweets but he remembered her avid excitement on the night\nof Rex Fortescues death and he saw in it not so much a ghoulish\nsatisfaction but rather a revelation of the arid deserts of boredom\nwhich encompassed her life.",
    "Her eyelids fluttered and fell before his\nsearching glance.",
    "They gave her the appearance of being both\nnervous and guilty but he could not be sure that that was really the\ncase.",
    "Im afraid he said soothingly we have to ask people questions\nagain and again.",
    "It must be very tiresome for you all.",
    "I do appreciate\nthat but so much hangs you understand on the exact timing of\n\n\fevents.",
    "You came down to tea rather late I understand In fact.",
    "Miss\nDove came up and fetched you.",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes she did.",
    "She came and said tea was in.",
    "I had no idea it was\nso late.",
    "Id been writing letters.",
    "Inspector Neele just glanced over at the writingdesk.",
    "I see he said.",
    "Somehow or other I thought youd been out for a\nwalk.",
    "Did she say so Yes  now I believe youre right.",
    "I had been writing\nletters then it was so stuffy and my head ached so I went out and  er went for a walk.",
    "Only round the garden.",
    "I see.",
    "You didnt meet anyone\n\nMeet anyone She stared at him.",
    "What do you mean\n\nI just wondered if youd seen anybody or anybody had seen you\nduring this walk of yours.",
    "I saw the gardener in the distance thats all.",
    "She was looking at him\nsuspiciously.",
    "Then you came in came up here to your room and you were just\ntaking your things off when Miss Dove came in to tell you that tea was\nready\n\nYes.",
    "Yes and so I came down.",
    "And who was there\n\nAdele and Elaine and a minute or two later Lance arrived.",
    "My\nbrotherinlaw you know.",
    "The one whos come back from Kenya.",
    "And then you all had tea\n\nYes we had tea.",
    "Then Lance went up to see Aunt Effie and I came up\nhere to finish my letters.",
    "I left Elaine there with Adele.",
    "He nodded reassuringly.",
    "Yes.",
    "Miss Fortescue seems to have been with Mrs Fortescue for quite\nfive or ten minutes after you left.",
    "Your husband hadnt come home\nyet\n\nOh no.",
    "Percy  Val  didnt get home until about halfpast six of seven.",
    "Hed been kept up in town.",
    "He came back by train\n\nYes.",
    "He took a taxi from the station.",
    "Was it unusual for him to come back by train\n\nHe does sometimes.",
    "Not very often.",
    "I think hed been to places in the\ncity where its rather difficult to park the car.",
    "It was easier for him to\ntake a train home from Cannon Street.",
    "I see said Inspector Neele.",
    "He went on I asked your husband if Mrs\nFortescue had made a will before she died.",
    "He said he thought not.",
    "I\nsuppose you dont happen to have any idea\n\nTo his surprise Jennifer Fortescue nodded vigorously.",
    "Oh yes she said.",
    "Adele made a will.",
    "She told me so.",
    "Indeed When was this\n\nOh it wasnt very long ago.",
    "About a month ago I think.",
    "Thats very interesting said Inspector Neele.",
    "Mrs Percival leant forward eagerly.",
    "Her face now was all animation.",
    "She clearly enjoyed exhibiting her superior knowledge.",
    "Val didnt know about it she said.",
    "Nobody knew.",
    "It just happened\nthat I found out about it.",
    "I was in the street.",
    "I had just come out of the\nstationers then I saw Adele coming out of the solicitors office.",
    "Ansell\nand Worralls you know.",
    "In the High Street.",
    "Ah said Neele the local solicitors\n\nYes.",
    "And I said to Adele Whatever have you been doing there I said.",
    "And she laughed and said Wouldnt you like to know And then as we\nwalked along together she said Ill tell you Jennifer.",
    "Ive been making\nmy will.",
    "Well I said why are you doing that Adele youre not ill or\nanything are you And she said no of course she wasnt ill.",
    "Shed\nnever felt better.",
    "But everyone ought to make a will.",
    "She said she\n\n\fwasnt going to those stuckup family solicitors in London Mr\nBillingsley.",
    "She said the old sneak would go round and tell the family.",
    "No she said My wills my own business Jennifer and Ill make it my\nown way and nobodys going to know about it.",
    "Well Adele I said I\nshant tell anybody.",
    "She said It doesnt matter if you do.",
    "You wont\nknow whats in it.",
    "But I didnt tell anyone.",
    "No not even Percy.",
    "I do think\nwomen ought to stick together dont you Inspector Neele\n\nIm sure thats a very nice feeling on your part Mrs Fortescue said\nInspector Neele diplomatically.",
    "Im sure Im never illnatured said Jennifer.",
    "I didnt particularly care\nfor Adele if you know what I mean.",
    "I always thought she was the kind\nof woman who would stick at nothing in order to get what she wanted.",
    "Now shes dead perhaps I misjudged her poor soul.",
    "Well thank you very much Mrs Fortescue for being so helpful to me.",
    "Youre welcome Im sure.",
    "Im only too glad to do anything I can.",
    "Its all\nso very terrible isnt it Who is the old lady whos arrived this\nmorning\n\nShes a Miss Marple.",
    "She very kindly came here to give us what\ninformation she could about the girl Gladys.",
    "It seems Gladys Martin\nwas once in service with her.",
    "Really How interesting.",
    "Theres one other thing Mrs Percival.",
    "Do you know anything about\nblackbirds\n\n\fJennifer Fortescue started violently.",
    "She dropped her handbag on the\nfloor and bent to pick it up.",
    "Blackbirds Inspector Blackbirds What kind of blackbirds\n\nHer voice was rather breathless.",
    "Smiling a little.",
    "Inspector Neele said\n\nJust blackbirds.",
    "Alive or dead or even shall we say symbolical\n\nJennifer Fortescue said sharply\n\nI dont know what you mean.",
    "I dont know what youre talking about.",
    "You dont know anything about blackbirds then Mrs Fortescue\n\nShe said slowly\n\nI suppose you mean the ones last summer in the pie.",
    "All very silly.",
    "There were some left on the library table too werent there\n\nIt was all a very silly practical joke.",
    "I dont know whos been talking to\nyou about it.",
    "Mr Fortescue my fatherinlaw was very much annoyed\nby it.",
    "Just annoyed Nothing more\n\nOh.",
    "I see what you mean.",
    "Yes I suppose  yes its true.",
    "He asked us if\nthere were any strangers about the place.",
    "Strangers Inspector Neele raised his eyebrows.",
    "Well thats what he said said Mrs Percival defensively.",
    "Strangers repeated Inspector Neele thoughtfully.",
    "Then he asked\nDid he seem afraid in any way\n\nAfraid I dont know what you mean.",
    "Nervous.",
    "About strangers I mean.",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes he did rather.",
    "Of course I dont remember very well.",
    "It was\nseveral months ago you know.",
    "I dont think it was anything except a\nsilly practical joke.",
    "Crump perhaps.",
    "I really do think that Crump is a\nvery unbalanced man and Im perfectly certain that he drinks.",
    "Hes\nreally very insolent in his manner sometimes.",
    "Ive sometimes\nwondered if he could have had a grudge against Mr Fortescue.",
    "Do you\nthink thats possible Inspector\n\nAnythings possible said Inspector Neele and went away.",
    "II\n\nPercival Fortescue was in London but Inspector Neele found Lancelot\nsitting with his wife in the library.",
    "They were playing chess together.",
    "I dont want to interrupt you said Neele apologetically.",
    "Were only killing time.",
    "Inspector arent we Pat\n\n\fPat nodded.",
    "I expect youll think its rather a foolish question Im asking you said\nNeele.",
    "Do you know anything about blackbirds Mr Fortescue\n\nBlackbirds Lance looked amused.",
    "What kind of blackbirds Do you\nmean genuine birds or the slave trade\n\nInspector Neele said with a sudden disarming smile\n\nIm not sure what I mean Mr Fortescue.",
    "Its just that a mention of\nblackbirds has turned up.",
    "Good Lord.",
    "Lancelot looked suddenly alert Not the old Blackbird\nMine I suppose\n\nInspector Neele said sharply\n\nThe Blackbird Mine What was that\n\nLance frowned in a puzzled fashion.",
    "The trouble is.",
    "Inspector that I cant really remember much myself.",
    "I\njust have a vague idea about some shady transaction in my papas\npast.",
    "Something on the West Coast of Africa.",
    "Aunt Effie I believe once\nthrew it in his teeth but I cant remember anything definite about it.",
    "Aunt Effie That will be Miss Ramsbottom wont it\n\n\fYes.",
    "Ill go and ask her about it said Inspector Neele.",
    "He added ruefully\nShes rather a formidable old lady Mr Fortescue.",
    "Always makes me\nfeel quite nervous.",
    "Lance laughed.",
    "Yes.",
    "Aunt Effie is certainly a character but she may be helpful to you.",
    "Inspector if you get on the right side of her.",
    "Especially if youre delving\ninto the past.",
    "Shes got an excellent memory she takes a positive\npleasure in remembering anything thats detrimental in any way.",
    "He\nadded thoughtfully Theres something else.",
    "I went up to see her you\nknow soon after I got back here.",
    "Immediately after tea that day as a\nmatter of fact.",
    "And she was talking about Gladys.",
    "The maid who got\nkilled.",
    "Not that we knew she was dead then of course.",
    "But Aunt Effie\nwas saying she was quite convinced that Gladys knew something that\nshe hadnt told the police.",
    "That seems fairly certain said Inspector Neele.",
    "Shell never tell it\nnow poor girl.",
    "No.",
    "It seems Aunt Effie had given her good advice as to spilling\nanything she knew.",
    "Pity the girl didnt take it.",
    "Inspector Neele nodded.",
    "Bracing himself for the encounter he\npenetrated to Miss Ramsbottoms fortress.",
    "Rather to his surprise he\nfound Miss Marple there.",
    "The two ladies appeared to be discussing\nforeign missions.",
    "Ill go away Inspector.",
    "Miss Marple rose hurriedly to her feet.",
    "No need madam said Inspector Neele.",
    "Ive asked Miss Marple to come and stay in the house said Miss\nRamsbottom.",
    "No sense in spending money in that ridiculous Golf\nHotel.",
    "A wicked nest of profiteers that is.",
    "Drinking and card playing all\nthe evening.",
    "Shed better come and stay in a decent Christian\nhousehold.",
    "Theres a room next door to mine.",
    "Dr Mary Peters the\nmissionary had it last.",
    "Its very very kind of you said Miss Marple but I really think I\nmustnt intrude in a house of mourning.",
    "Mourning Fiddlesticks said Miss Ramsbottom.",
    "Wholl weep for Rex\nin this house Or Adele either Or is it the police youre worried about\nAny objections Inspector\n\nNone from me madam.",
    "There you are said Miss Ramsbottom.",
    "Its very kind of you said Miss Marple gratefully.",
    "Ill go and\ntelephone to the hotel to cancel my booking.",
    "She left the room and\nMiss Ramsbottom said sharply to the Inspector\n\nWell and what do you want\n\nI wondered if you could tell me anything about the Blackbird Mine\nmaam.",
    "Miss Ramsbottom uttered a sudden shrill cackle of laughter.",
    "Ha.",
    "Youve got on to that have you Took the hint I gave you the other\nday.",
    "Well what do you want to know about it\n\nAnything you can tell me madam.",
    "I cant tell you much.",
    "Its a long time ago now  oh twenty to twentyfive years maybe.",
    "Some concession or other in East Africa.",
    "My\nbrotherinlaw went into it with a man called MacKenzie.",
    "They went out\nthere to investigate the mine together and MacKenzie died out there of\nfever.",
    "Rex came home and said the claim or the concession or\nwhatever you call it was worthless.",
    "Thats all I know.",
    "I think you know a little more than that maam said Neele\npersuasively.",
    "Anything else is hearsay.",
    "You dont like hearsay in the law so Ive\nbeen told.",
    "Were not in court yet maam.",
    "Well I cant tell you anything.",
    "The MacKenzies kicked up a fuss.",
    "Thats all I know.",
    "They insisted that Rex had swindled MacKenzie.",
    "I\ndaresay he did.",
    "He was a clever unscrupulous fellow but Ive no\ndoubt whatever he did it was all legal.",
    "They couldnt prove anything.",
    "Mrs MacKenzie was an unbalanced sort of woman.",
    "She came here and\nmade a lot of threats of revenge.",
    "Said Rex had murdered her husband.",
    "Silly melodramatic fuss I think she was a bit off her head  in fact I\n\n\fbelieve she went into an asylum not long after.",
    "Came here dragging\nalong a couple of young children who looked scared to death.",
    "Said\nshed bring up her children to have revenge.",
    "Something like that.",
    "Tomfoolery all of it.",
    "Well thats all I can tell you.",
    "And mind you the\nBlackbird Mine wasnt the only swindle that Rex put over in his lifetime.",
    "Youll find a good many more if you look for them.",
    "What put you on to\nthe Blackbird Did you come across some trail leading to the\nMacKenzies\n\nYou dont know what became of the family maam\n\nNo idea said Miss Ramsbottom.",
    "Mind you I dont think Rex would\nhave actually murdered MacKenzie but he might have left him to die.",
    "The same thing before the Lord but not the same thing before the law.",
    "If he did retributions caught up with him.",
    "The mills of God grind\nslowly but they grind exceeding small  youd better go away now I\ncant tell you any more and its no good your asking.",
    "Thank you very much for what you have told me said Inspector\nNeele.",
    "Send that Marple woman back Miss Ramsbottom called after him.",
    "Shes frivolous like all Church of England people but she knows how\nto run a charity in a sensible way.",
    "Inspector Neele made a couple of telephone calls the first to Ansell\nand Worrall and the second to the Golf Hotel then he summoned\nSergeant Hay and told him that he was leaving the house for a short\nperiod.",
    "Ive a call to pay at a solicitors office  after that you can get me at\nthe Golf Hotel if anything urgent turns up.",
    "Yes sir.",
    "And find out anything you can about blackbirds added Neele over\nhis shoulder.",
    "Blackbirds sir Sergeant Hay repeated thoroughly mystified.",
    "Thats what I said  not blackberry jelly  blackbirds.",
    "Very good sir said Sergeant Hay bewilderedly.",
    "Chapter 17\n\nInspector Neele found Mr Ansell the type of solicitor who was more\neasily intimidated than intimidating.",
    "A member of a small and not very\nprosperous firm he was anxious not to stand upon his rights but\ninstead to assist the police in every way possible.",
    "Yes he said he had made a will for the late Mrs Adele Fortescue.",
    "She\nhad called at his office about five weeks previously.",
    "It had seemed to\nhim rather a peculiar business but naturally he had not said anything.",
    "Peculiar things did happen in a solicitors business and of course the\nInspector would understand that discretion etc.",
    "etc.",
    "The Inspector\nnodded to show he understood.",
    "He had already discovered Mr Ansell\nhad not transacted any legal business previously for Mrs Fortescue or\nfor any of the Fortescue family.",
    "Naturally said Mr Ansell she didnt want to go to her husbands\nfirm of lawyers about this.",
    "Shorn of verbiage the facts were simple.",
    "Adele Fortescue had made a\nwill leaving everything of which she died possessed to Vivian Dubois.",
    "But I gathered said Mr Ansell looking at Neele in an interrogating\nmanner that she hadnt actually much to leave.",
    "Inspector Neele nodded.",
    "At the time Adele Fortescue made her will\nthat was true enough.",
    "But since then Rex Fortescue had died and\nAdele Fortescue had inherited 100000 pounds and presumably that\n100000 pounds less death duties now belonged to Vivian Edward\nDubois.",
    "II\n\nAt the Golf Hotel Inspector Neele found Vivian Dubois nervously\nawaiting his arrival.",
    "Dubois had been on the point of leaving indeed\nhis bags were packed when he had received over the telephone a civil\nrequest from Inspector Neele to remain.",
    "Inspector Neele had been\nvery pleasant about it quite apologetic.",
    "But behind the conventional\nwords the request had been an order.",
    "Vivian Dubois had demurred\nbut not too much.",
    "He said now\n\nI do hope you realise Inspector Neele that it is very inconvenient for\nme to have to stay on.",
    "I really have urgent business that needs\nattending to.",
    "I didnt know you were in business Mr Dubois said Inspector Neele\ngenially.",
    "Im afraid none of us can be as leisured as we would like to appear to\nbe nowadays.",
    "Mrs Fortescues death must have been a great shock to you Mr\nDubois.",
    "You were great friends were you not\n\nYes said Dubois she was a charming woman.",
    "We played golf quite\noften together.",
    "I expect youll miss her very much.",
    "Yes indeed.",
    "Dubois sighed.",
    "The whole thing is really quite quite\nterrible.",
    "You actually telephoned her I believe on the afternoon of her\ndeath\n\nDid I I really cannot remember now.",
    "About four oclock I understand.",
    "Yes I believe I did.",
    "Dont you remember what your conversation was about Mr Dubois\n\n\fIt wasnt of any significance.",
    "I think I asked her how she was feeling\nand if there was any further news about her husbands death  a more\nor less conventional inquiry.",
    "I see said Inspector Neele.",
    "He added And then you went out for a\nwalk\n\nEr  yes  yes I  I did I think.",
    "At least not a walk I played a few holes\nof golf.",
    "Inspector Neele said gently\n\nI think not Mr Dubois... Not that particular day...",
    "The porter here\nnoticed you walking down the road towards Yewtree Lodge.",
    "Duboiss eyes met his then shied away again nervously.",
    "Im afraid I cant remember.",
    "Inspector.",
    "Perhaps you actually went to call upon Mrs Fortescue\n\nDubois said sharply\n\nNo.",
    "No I didnt do that.",
    "I never went near the house.",
    "Where did you go then\n\nOh I  went on down the road down as far as the Three Pigeons and\nthen I turned around and came back by the links.",
    "Youre quite sure you didnt go to Yewtree Lodge\n\nQuite sure.",
    "Inspector.",
    "The Inspector shook his head.",
    "Come now Mr Dubois he said its much better to be frank with us\nyou know.",
    "You may have had some quite innocent reason for going\nthere.",
    "I tell you I never went to see Mrs Fortescue that day.",
    "The Inspector stood up.",
    "You know Mr Dubois he said pleasantly I think well have to ask\nyou for a statement and youll be well advised and quite within your\nrights in having a solicitor present when you are making that\nstatement.",
    "The colour fled from Mr Duboiss face leaving it a sickly greenish\ncolour.",
    "Youre threatening me he said.",
    "Youre threatening me.",
    "No no nothing of the kind.",
    "Inspector Neele spoke in a shocked\nvoice.",
    "Were not allowed to do anything of that sort.",
    "Quite the\ncontrary.",
    "Im actually pointing out to you that you have certain rights.",
    "I had nothing to do with it at all I tell you Nothing to do with it.",
    "Come now Mr Dubois you were at Yewtree Lodge round about halfpast four on that day.",
    "Somebody looked out of the window you know\nand saw you.",
    "I was only in the garden.",
    "I didnt go into the house.",
    "Didnt you said Inspector Neele.",
    "Are you sure Didnt you go in by\nthe side door and up the stairs to Mrs Fortescues sittingroom on the\nfirst floor You were looking for something werent you in the desk\nthere\n\nYouve got them I suppose said Dubois sullenly.",
    "That fool Adele\nkept them then  she swore she burnt them  But they dont mean what\nyou think they mean.",
    "Youre not denying are you Mr Dubois that you were a very close\nfriend of Mrs Fortescues\n\nNo of course Im not.",
    "How can I when youve got the letters All I say\nis theres no need to go reading any sinister meaning into them.",
    "Dont\nthink for a moment that we  that she  ever thought of getting rid of\nRex Fortescue.",
    "Good God Im not that kind of man\n\nBut perhaps she was that kind of woman\n\nNonsense cried Vivian Dubois wasnt she killed too\n\nOh yes yes.",
    "Well isnt it natural to believe that the same person who killed her\nhusband killed her\n\nIt might be.",
    "It certainly might be.",
    "But there are other solutions.",
    "For\ninstance  this is quite a hypothetical case Mr Dubois its possible\nthat Mrs Fortescue got rid of her husband and that after his death she\nbecame somewhat of a danger to someone else.",
    "Someone who had\nperhaps not helped her in what she had done but who had at least\nencouraged her and provided shall we say the motive for the deed.",
    "She might be you know a danger to that particular person.",
    "Dubois stammered\n\nYou cccant build up a case against me.",
    "You cant.",
    "She made a will you know said Inspector Neele.",
    "She left all her\nmoney to you.",
    "Everything she possessed.",
    "I dont want the money.",
    "I dont want a penny of it.",
    "Of course it isnt very much really said Inspector Neele.",
    "Theres\njewellery and some furs but I imagine very little actual cash.",
    "Dubois stared at him his jaw dropping.",
    "But I thought her husband \n\nHe stopped dead.",
    "Did you Mr Dubois said Inspector Neele and there was steel now\nin his voice.",
    "Thats very interesting.",
    "I wondered if you knew the terms\nof Rex Fortescues will \n\nIII\n\nInspector Neeles second interview at the Golf Hotel was with Mr\nGerald Wright.",
    "Mr Gerald Wright was a thin intellectual and very\nsuperior young man.",
    "He was Inspector Neele noted not unlike Vivian\nDubois in build.",
    "What can I do for you Inspector Neele he asked.",
    "I thought you might be able to help us with a little information Mr\nWright.",
    "Information Really It seems very unlikely.",
    "Its in connection with the recent events at Yewtree Lodge.",
    "Youve\nheard of them of course\n\nInspector Neele put a little irony into the question.",
    "Mr Wright smiled\npatronisingly.",
    "Heard of them he said is hardly the right word.",
    "The newspapers\nappear to be full of nothing else.",
    "How incredibly bloodthirsty our\npublic press is What an age we live in On one side the manufacture of\natom bombs on the other our newspapers delight in reporting brutal\nmurders But you said you had some questions to ask.",
    "Really I cannot\n\n\fsee what they can be.",
    "I know nothing about this Yewtree Lodge affair.",
    "I\nwas actually in the Isle of Man when Mr Rex Fortescue was killed.",
    "You arrived here very shortly afterwards didnt you Mr Wright You\nhad a telegram I believe from Miss Elaine Fortescue.",
    "Our police know everything do they not Yes Elaine sent for me.",
    "I\ncame of course at once.",
    "And you are I understand shortly to be married\n\nQuite right Inspector Neele.",
    "You have no objections I hope.",
    "It is entirely Miss Fortescues business.",
    "I understand the attachment\nbetween you dates from some time back Six or seven months ago in\nfact\n\nQuite correct.",
    "You and Miss Fortescue became engaged to be married.",
    "Mr\nFortescue refused to give his consent informed you that if his\ndaughter married against his wishes he did not propose to give her an\nincome of any kind.",
    "Whereupon I understand you broke off the\nengagement and departed.",
    "Gerald Wright smiled rather pityingly.",
    "A very crude way of putting things Inspector Neele.",
    "Actually I was\nvictimised for my political opinions.",
    "Rex Fortescue was the worst type\n\n\fof capitalist.",
    "Naturally I could not sacrifice my political beliefs and\nconvictions for money.",
    "But you have no objections to marrying a wife who has just inherited\n50000 pounds \n\nGerald Wright gave a thin satisfied smile.",
    "Not at all Inspector Neele.",
    "The money will be used for the benefit of\nthe community.",
    "But surely you did not come here to discuss with me\neither my financial circumstances or my political convictions\n\nNo Mr Wright.",
    "I wanted to talk to you about a simple question of fact.",
    "As you are aware Mrs Adele Fortescue died as a result of cyanide\npoisoning on the afternoon of November the 5th.",
    "Since you were in the neighbourhood of Yewtree Lodge on that\nafternoon I thought it possible that you might have seen or heard\nsomething that had a bearing on the case.",
    "And what leads you to believe that I was as you call it in the\nneighbourhood of Yewtree Lodge at the time\n\nYou left this hotel at a quarter past four on that particular afternoon\nMr Wright.",
    "On leaving the hotel you walked down the road in the\ndirection of Yewtree Lodge.",
    "It seems natural to suppose that you were\ngoing there.",
    "I thought of it said Gerald Wright but I considered that it would be\na rather pointless thing to do.",
    "I already had an arrangement to meet\n\n\fMiss Fortescue  Elaine  at the hotel at six oclock.",
    "I went for a walk\nalong a lane that branches off from the main road and returned to the\nGolf Hotel just before six oclock.",
    "Elaine did not keep her appointment.",
    "Quite naturally under the circumstances.",
    "Anybody see you on this walk of yours Mr Wright\n\nA few cars passed me I think on the road.",
    "I did not see anyone I\nknew if thats what you mean.",
    "The lane was little more than a carttrack and too muddy for cars.",
    "So between the time you left the hotel at a quarter past four until six\noclock when you arrived back again Ive only your words for it as to\nwhere you were\n\nGerald Wright continued to smile in a superior fashion.",
    "Very distressing for us both Inspector but there it is.",
    "Inspector Neele said softly\n\nThen if someone said they looked out of a landing window and saw\nyou in the garden of Yewtree Lodge at about 435  he paused and left\nthe sentence unfinished.",
    "Gerald Wright raised his eyebrows and shook his head.",
    "Visibility must have been very bad by then he said.",
    "I think it would\nbe difficult for anyone to be sure.",
    "Are you acquainted with Mr Vivian Dubois who is also staying here\n\nDubois.",
    "Dubois No I dont think so.",
    "Is that the tall dark man with a\npretty taste in suede shoes\n\nYes.",
    "He also was out for a walk that afternoon and he also left the\nhotel and walked past Yewtree Lodge.",
    "You did not notice him in the\nroad by any chance\n\nNo.",
    "No.",
    "I cant say I did.",
    "Gerald Wright looked for the first time faintly worried.",
    "Inspector Neele\nsaid thoughtfully\n\nIt wasnt really a very nice afternoon for walking especially after dark\nin a muddy lane.",
    "Curious how energetic everyone seems to have felt.",
    "IV\n\nOn Inspector Neeles return to the house he was greeted by Sergeant\nHay with an air of satisfaction.",
    "Ive found out about the blackbirds for you sir he said.",
    "You have have you\n\nYes sir in a pie they were.",
    "Cold pie was left out for Sunday nights\nsupper.",
    "Somebody got at that pie in the larder or somewhere.",
    "Theyd\ntaken off the crust and theyd taken out the veal and am what was\ninside it and what dyou think they put in instead Some stinkin\n\n\fblackbirds they got out of the gardeners shed.",
    "Nasty sort of trick to\nplay wasnt it\n\nWasnt that a dainty dish to set before the king said Inspector\nNeele.",
    "He left Sergeant Hay staring after him.",
    "Chapter 18\n\nJust wait a minute said Miss Ramsbottom.",
    "This Patience is going to\ncome out.",
    "She transferred a king and his various impedimenta into an empty\nspace put a red seven on a black eight built up the four five and six of\nspades on her foundation heap made a few more rapid transfers of\ncards and then leaned back with a sigh of satisfaction.",
    "Thats the Double Jester she said.",
    "It doesnt often come out.",
    "She leaned back in a satisfied fashion then raised her eyes at the girl\nstanding by the fireplace.",
    "So youre Lances wife she said.",
    "Pat who had been summoned upstairs to Miss Ramsbottoms\npresence nodded her head.",
    "Yes she said.",
    "Youre a tall girl said Miss Ramsbottom and you look healthy.",
    "Im very healthy.",
    "Miss Ramsbottom nodded in a satisfied manner.",
    "Percivals wife is pasty she said.",
    "Eats too many sweets and doesnt\ntake enough exercise.",
    "Well sit down child sit down.",
    "Where did you\nmeet my nephew\n\nI met him out in Kenya when I was staying there with some friends.",
    "Youve been married before I understand.",
    "Yes.",
    "Twice.",
    "Miss Ramsbottom gave a profound sniff.",
    "Divorce I suppose.",
    "No said Pat.",
    "Her voice trembled a little.",
    "They both  died.",
    "My first\nhusband was a fighter pilot.",
    "He was killed in the war.",
    "And your second husband Let me see  somebody told me.",
    "Shot\nhimself didnt he\n\nPat nodded.",
    "Your fault\n\n\fNo said Pat.",
    "It wasnt my fault.",
    "Racing man wasnt he\n\nYes.",
    "Ive never been on a racecourse in my life said Miss Ramsbottom.",
    "Betting and card playing  all devices of the devil\n\nPat did not reply.",
    "I wouldnt go inside a theatre or a cinema said Miss Ramsbottom.",
    "Ah well its a wicked world nowadays.",
    "A lot of wickedness was going\non in this house but the Lord struck them down.",
    "Pat still found it difficult to say anything.",
    "She wondered if Lances Aunt\nEffie was really quite all there.",
    "She was however a trifle disconcerted\nby the old ladys shrewd glance at her.",
    "How much demanded Aunt Effie do you know about the family\nyouve married into\n\nI suppose said Pat as much as one ever knows of the family one\nmarries into.",
    "Hm something in that something in that.",
    "Well Ill tell you this.",
    "My\nsister was a fool my brotherinlaw was a rogue Percival is a sneak\nand your Lance was always the bad boy of the family.",
    "I think thats all nonsense said Pat robustly.",
    "Maybe youre right said Miss Ramsbottom unexpectedly.",
    "You cant\njust stick labels on people.",
    "But dont underestimate Percival.",
    "Theres a\ntendency to believe that those who are labelled good are also stupid.",
    "Percival isnt the least bit stupid.",
    "Hes quite clever in a sanctimonious\nkind of way.",
    "Ive never cared for him.",
    "Mind you I dont trust Lance and\nI dont approve of him but I cant help being fond of him... Hes a\nreckless sort of fellow  always has been.",
    "Youve got to look after him\nand see he doesnt go too far.",
    "Tell him not to underestimate Percival\nmy dear.",
    "Tell him not to believe everything that Percival says.",
    "Theyre\nall liars in this house.",
    "The old lady added with satisfaction Fire and brimstone shall be their\nportion.",
    "II\n\nInspector Neele was finishing a telephone conversation with Scotland\nYard.",
    "The Assistant Commissioner at the other end said\n\nWe ought to be able to get that information for you  by circularising\nthe various private sanatoriums.",
    "Of course she may be dead.",
    "Probably is.",
    "Its a long time ago.",
    "Old sins cast long shadows.",
    "Miss Ramsbottom had said that  said it\nwith significance too  as though she was giving him a hint.",
    "Its a fantastic theory said the A.C.\n\nDont I know it sir.",
    "But I dont feel we can ignore it altogether.",
    "Too\nmuch fits in \n\nYes  yes  rye  blackbirds  the mans Christian name \n\nNeele said\n\nIm concentrating on the other lines too  Dubois is a possibility  so is\nWright  the girl Gladys could have caught sight of either of them\noutside the side door  she could have left the teatray in the hall and\ngone out to see who it was and what they were doing  whoever it was\ncould have strangled her then and there and carried her body round to\nthe clothes line and put the peg on her nose.",
    "A crazy thing to do in all conscience A nasty one too.",
    "Yes sir.",
    "Thats what upset the old lady  Miss Marple I mean.",
    "Nice old\nlady  and very shrewd.",
    "Shes moved into the house  to be near old\nMiss Ramsbottom  and Ive no doubt shell get to hear anything thats\ngoing.",
    "Whats your next move Neele\n\nIve an appointment with the London solicitors.",
    "I want to find out a\nlittle more about Rex Fortescues affairs.",
    "And though its old history I\nwant to hear a little more about the Blackbird Mine.",
    "III\n\n\fMr Billingsley of Billingsley Horsethorpe  Walters was an urbane\nman whose discretion was concealed habitually by a misleading\nforthcoming manner.",
    "It was the second interview that Inspector Neele\nhad had with him and on this occasion Mr Billingsleys discretion was\nless noticeable than it had been on the former one.",
    "The triple tragedy\nat Yewtree Lodge had shaken Mr Billingsley out of his professional\nreserve.",
    "He was now only too anxious to put all the facts he could\nbefore the police.",
    "Most extraordinary business this whole thing he said.",
    "A most\nextraordinary business.",
    "I dont remember anything like it in all my\nprofessional career.",
    "Frankly Mr Billingsley said Inspector Neele we need all the help\nwe can get.",
    "You can count on me my dear sir.",
    "I shall be only too happy to assist\nyou in every way I can.",
    "First let me ask you how well you knew the late Mr Fortescue and\nhow well do you know the affairs of his firm\n\nI knew Rex Fortescue fairly well.",
    "That is to say Ive known him for a\nperiod of well sixteen years I should say.",
    "Mind you we are not the\nonly firm of solicitors he employed not by a long way.",
    "Inspector Neele nodded.",
    "He knew that.",
    "Billingsley Horsethorpe \nWalters were what one might describe as Rex Fortescues reputable\n\n\fsolicitors.",
    "For his less reputable dealings he had employed several\ndifferent and slightly less scrupulous firms.",
    "Now what do you want to know continued Mr Billingsley.",
    "Ive told\nyou about his will.",
    "Percival Fortescue is the residuary legatee.",
    "Im interested now said Inspector Neele in the will of his widow.",
    "On\nMr Fortescues death she came into the sum of one hundred thousand\npounds I understand\n\nBillingsley nodded his head.",
    "A considerable sum of money he said and I may tell you in\nconfidence Inspector that it is one the firm could ill have afforded to\npay out.",
    "The firm then is not prosperous\n\nFrankly said Mr Billingsley and strictly between ourselves its\ndrifting on to the rocks and has been for the last year and a half.",
    "For any particular reason\n\nWhy yes.",
    "I should say the reason was Rex Fortescue himself.",
    "For the\nlast year Rex Fortescues been acting like a madman.",
    "Selling good\nstock here buying speculative stuff there talking big about it all the\ntime in the most extraordinary way.",
    "Wouldnt listen to advice.",
    "Percival the son you know  he came here urging me to use my influence with\nhis father.",
    "Hed tried apparently and been swept aside.",
    "Well I did\n\n\fwhat I could but Fortescue wouldnt listen to reason.",
    "Really he seems\nto have been a changed man.",
    "But not I gather a depressed man said Inspector Neele.",
    "No no.",
    "Quite the contrary.",
    "Flamboyant bombastic.",
    "Inspector Neele nodded.",
    "An idea which had already taken form in his\nmind was strengthened.",
    "He thought he was beginning to understand\nsome of the causes of friction between Percival and his father.",
    "Mr\nBillingsley was continuing.",
    "But its no good asking me about the wifes will.",
    "I didnt make any will\nfor her.",
    "No.",
    "I know that said Neele.",
    "Im merely verifying that she had\nsomething to leave.",
    "In short a hundred thousand pounds.",
    "Mr Billingsley was shaking his head violently.",
    "No no my dear sir.",
    "Youre wrong there.",
    "Do you mean the hundred thousand pounds was only left to her for\nher lifetime\n\nNo  no  it was left to her outright.",
    "But there was a clause in the will\ngoverning that bequest.",
    "That is to say Fortescues wife did not inherit\nthe sum unless she survived him for one month.",
    "That I may say is a\nclause fairly common nowadays.",
    "It has come into operation owing to\nthe uncertainties of air travel.",
    "If two people are killed in an air\n\n\faccident it becomes exceedingly difficult to say who was the survivor\nand a lot of very curious problems arise.",
    "Inspector Neele was staring at him.",
    "Then Adele Fortescue had not got a hundred thousand pounds to\nleave.",
    "What happens to that money\n\nIt goes back into the firm.",
    "Or rather I should say it goes to the\nresiduary legatee.",
    "And the residuary legatee is Mr Percival Fortescue.",
    "Thats right said Billingsley it goes to Percival Fortescue.",
    "And with\nthe state the firms affairs are in he added unguardedly I should say\nthat hell need it\n\nIV\n\nThe things you policemen want to know said Inspector Neeles\ndoctor friend.",
    "Come on Bob spill it.",
    "Well as were alone together you cant quote me fortunately But I\nshould say you know that your ideas dead right.",
    "G.P.I.",
    "by the sound\nof it all.",
    "The family suspected it and wanted to get him to see a doctor.",
    "He wouldnt.",
    "It acts just in the way you describe.",
    "Loss of judgment\nmegalomania violent fits of irritation and anger  boastfulness delusions of grandeur  of being a great financial genius.",
    "Anyone\n\n\fsuffering from that would soon put a solvent firm on the rocks  unless\nhe could be restrained  and thats not so easy to do  especially if the\nman himself has an idea of what youre after.",
    "Yes  I should say it was a\nbit of luck for your friends that he died.",
    "Theyre no friends of mine said Neele.",
    "He repeated what he had\nonce said before\n\nTheyre all very unpleasant people...\n\nChapter 19\n\nIn the drawingroom at Yewtree Lodge the whole Fortescue family\nwas assembled.",
    "Percival Fortescue leaning against the mantelpiece\nwas addressing the meeting.",
    "Its all very well said Percival.",
    "But the whole position is most\nunsatisfactory.",
    "The police come and go and dont tell us anything.",
    "One\nsupposes theyre pursuing some line of research.",
    "In the meantime\neverythings at a standstill.",
    "One cant make plans one cant arrange\nthings for the future.",
    "Its all so inconsiderate said Jennifer.",
    "And so stupid.",
    "There still seems to be this ban against anyone leaving the house\nwent on Percival.",
    "Still I think among ourselves we might discuss\nfuture plans.",
    "What about you Elaine I gather youre going to marry whatshisname  Gerald Wright Have you any idea when\n\nAs soon as possible said Elaine.",
    "Percival frowned.",
    "You mean in about six months time\n\nNo I dont.",
    "Why should we wait six months\n\nI think it would be more decent said Percival.",
    "Rubbish said Elaine.",
    "A month.",
    "Thats the longest well wait.",
    "Well its for you to say said Percival.",
    "And what are your plans when\nyou are married if you have any\n\nWere thinking of starting a school.",
    "Percival shook his head.",
    "Thats a very risky speculation in these times.",
    "What with the shortage\nof domestic labour the difficulty of getting an adequate teaching staff really Elaine it sounds all right.",
    "But I should think twice about it if I\nwere you.",
    "We have thought.",
    "Gerald feels that the whole future of this country\nlies in right education.",
    "I am seeing Mr Billingsley the day after tomorrow said Percival.",
    "Weve got to go into various questions of finance.",
    "He was suggesting\nthat you might like to make this money thats been left to you by father\n\n\finto a trust for yourself and your children.",
    "Its a very sound thing to do\nnowadays.",
    "I dont want to do that said Elaine.",
    "We shall need the money to start\nup our school.",
    "Theres a very suitable house weve heard of for sale.",
    "Its in Cornwall.",
    "Beautiful grounds and quite a good house.",
    "It would\nhave to be built on to a good deal  several wings added.",
    "You mean  you mean youre going to take all your money out of the\nbusiness Really Elaine I dont think youre wise.",
    "Much wiser to take it out than leave it in I should say said Elaine.",
    "Businesses are going phut all over the place.",
    "You said yourself Val\nbefore father died that things were getting into a pretty bad state.",
    "One says that sort of thing said Percival vaguely but I must say\nElaine to take out all your capital and sink it in the buying equipping\nand running of a school is crazy.",
    "If its not a success look what\nhappens Youre left without a penny.",
    "It will be a success said Elaine doggedly.",
    "Im with you.",
    "Lance lying sprawled out in a chair spoke up\nencouragingly.",
    "Have a crack at it Elaine.",
    "In my opinion itll be a\ndamned odd sort of school but its what you want to do  you and\nGerald.",
    "If you do lose your money youll at any rate have had the\nsatisfaction of doing what you wanted to do.",
    "Just what one might have expected you to say Lance said Percival\nacidly.",
    "I know I know said Lance.",
    "Im the spendthrift prodigal son.",
    "But I\nstill think Ive had more fun out of life than you have Percy old boy.",
    "It depends on what you call fun said Percival coldly.",
    "Which brings\nus to your own plans Lance.",
    "I suppose youll be off again back to\nKenya  or Canada  or climbing Mount Everest or something fairly\nfantastic\n\nNow what makes you think that said Lance.",
    "Well youve never had much use for a stayathome life in England\nhave you\n\nOne changes as one gets older said Lance.",
    "One settles down.",
    "Dyou know Percy my boy Im quite looking forward to having a crack\nat being a sober business man.",
    "Do you mean...",
    "I mean Im coming into the firm with you old boy.",
    "Lance grinned.",
    "Oh youre the senior partner of course.",
    "Youve got the lions share.",
    "Im only a very junior partner.",
    "But I have got a holding in it that gives\nme the right to be in on things doesnt it\n\nWell  yes  of course if you put it that way.",
    "But I can assure you my\ndear boy youll be very very bored.",
    "I wonder now.",
    "I dont believe I shall be bored.",
    "Percival frowned.",
    "You dont seriously mean.",
    "Lance that youre coming into the\nbusiness\n\nHaving a finger in the pie Yes thats exactly what I am doing.",
    "Percival shook his head.",
    "Things are in a very bad way you know.",
    "Youll find that out.",
    "Its going\nto be about all we can do to pay out Elaine her share if she insists on\nhaving it paid out.",
    "There you are Elaine said Lance.",
    "You see how wise you were to\ninsist on grabbing your money while its still there to grab.",
    "Really Lance Percival spoke angrily these jokes of yours are in\nvery bad taste.",
    "I do think Lance you might be more careful what you say said\nJennifer.",
    "Sitting a little way away near the window Pat studied them one by one.",
    "If this was what Lance had meant by twisting Percivals tail she could\nsee that he was achieving his object.",
    "Percivals neat impassivity was\nquite ruffled.",
    "He snapped again angrily\n\nAre you serious.",
    "Lance\n\nDead serious.",
    "It wont work you know.",
    "Youll soon get fed up.",
    "Not me.",
    "Think what a lovely change itll be for me.",
    "A city office typists\ncoming and going.",
    "I shall have a blonde secretary like Miss Grosvenor\n is it Grosvenor I suppose youve snaffled her.",
    "But I shall get one just\nlike her.",
    "Yes Mr Lancelot no Mr Lancelot.",
    "Your tea Mr Lancelot.",
    "Oh dont play the fool snapped Percival.",
    "Why are you so angry my dear brother Dont you look forward to\nhaving me sharing your city cares\n\nYou havent the least conception of the mess everythings in.",
    "No.",
    "Youll have to put me wise to all that.",
    "First youve got to understand that for the last six months  no more a\nyear fathers not been himself.",
    "Hes done the most incredibly foolish\nthings financially.",
    "Sold out good stock acquired various wildcat\nholdings.",
    "Sometimes hes really thrown away money hand over fist.",
    "Just one might say for the fun of spending it.",
    "In fact said Lance its just as well for the family that he had taxine\nin his tea.",
    "Thats a very ugly way of putting it but in essence youre quite right.",
    "Its about the only thing that saved us from bankruptcy.",
    "But we shall\nhave to be extremely conservative and go very cautiously for a bit.",
    "Lance shook his head.",
    "I dont agree with you.",
    "Caution never does anyone any good.",
    "You\nmust take a few risks strike out.",
    "You must go for something big.",
    "I dont agree said Percy.",
    "Caution and economy.",
    "Those are our\nwatchwords.",
    "Not mine said Lance.",
    "Youre only the junior partner remember said Percival.",
    "All right all right.",
    "But Ive got a little sayso all the same.",
    "Percival walked up and down the room agitatedly.",
    "Its no good.",
    "Lance.",
    "Im fond of you and all that \n\nAre you Lance interpolated.",
    "Percival did not appear to hear him.",
    "... but I really dont think were going to pull together at all.",
    "Our\noutlooks are totally different.",
    "That may be an advantage said Lance.",
    "The only sensible thing said Percival is to dissolve the\npartnership.",
    "Youre going to buy me out  is that the idea\n\n\fMy dear boy its the only sensible thing to do with our ideas so\ndifferent.",
    "If you find it hard to pay Elaine out her legacy how are you going to\nmanage to pay me my share\n\nWell I didnt mean in cash said Percival.",
    "We could  er  divide up\nthe holdings.",
    "With you keeping the giltedged and me taking the worst of the\nspeculative off you I suppose\n\nThey seem to be what you prefer said Percival.",
    "Lance grinned suddenly.",
    "Youre right in a way Percy old boy.",
    "But I cant indulge my own taste\nentirely.",
    "Ive got Pat here to think of.",
    "Both men looked towards her.",
    "Pat opened her mouth then shut it\nagain.",
    "Whatever game Lance was playing it was best that she should\nnot interfere.",
    "That Lance was driving at something special she was\nquite sure but she was still a little uncertain as to what his actual\nobject was.",
    "Line em up Percy said Lance laughing.",
    "Bogus Diamond Mines\nInaccessible Rubies the Oil Concessions where no oil is.",
    "Do you think\nIm quite as big a fool as I look\n\nPercival said\n\n\fOf course some of these holdings are highly speculative but\nremember they may turn out immensely valuable.",
    "Changed your tune havent you said Lance grinning.",
    "Going to\noffer me fathers latest wildcat acquisitions as well as the old\nBlackbird Mine and things of that kind.",
    "By the way has the Inspector\nbeen asking you about this Blackbird Mine\n\nPercival frowned.",
    "Yes he did.",
    "I cant imagine what he wanted to know about it.",
    "I couldnt\ntell him much.",
    "You and I were children at the time.",
    "I just remember\nvaguely that father went out there and came back saying the whole\nthing was no good.",
    "What was it  a gold mine\n\nI believe so.",
    "Father came back pretty certain that there was no gold\nthere.",
    "And mind you he wasnt the sort of man to be mistaken.",
    "Who got him into it A man called MacKenzie wasnt it\n\nYes.",
    "MacKenzie died out there.",
    "MacKenzie died out there said Lance thoughtfully.",
    "Wasnt there a\nterrific scene I seem to remember... Mrs MacKenzie wasnt it Came\nhere.",
    "Ranted and stormed at father.",
    "Hurled down curses on his head.",
    "She accused him if I remember rightly of murdering her husband.",
    "Really said Percival repressively.",
    "I cant recollect anything of the\nkind.",
    "I remember it though said Lance.",
    "I was a good bit younger than\nyou of course.",
    "Perhaps thats why it appealed to me.",
    "As a child it\nstruck me as full of drama.",
    "Where was Blackbird West Africa wasnt\nit\n\nYes I think so.",
    "I must look up the concession sometime said Lance when Im at\nthe office.",
    "You can be quite sure said Percival that father made no mistake.",
    "If\nhe came back saying there was no gold there was no gold.",
    "Youre probably right there said Lance.",
    "Poor Mrs MacKenzie.",
    "I\nwonder what happened to her and to those two kids she brought\nalong.",
    "Funny  they must be grown up by now.",
    "Chapter 20\n\nAt the Pinewood Private Sanatorium Inspector Neele sitting in the\nvisitors parlour was facing a greyhaired elderly lady.",
    "Helen\nMacKenzie was sixtythree though she looked younger.",
    "She had pale\nblue rather vacant looking eyes and a weak indeterminate chin.",
    "She\nhad a long upper lip which occasionally twitched.",
    "She held a large\nbook in her lap and was looking down at it as Inspector Neele talked to\nher.",
    "In Inspector Neeles mind was the conversation he had just had\nwith Doctor Crosbie the head of the establishment.",
    "Shes a voluntary patient of course said Doctor Crosbie not\ncertified.",
    "Shes not dangerous then\n\nOh no.",
    "Most of the time shes as sane to talk to as you or me.",
    "Its one\nof her good periods now so that youll be able to have a perfectly\nnormal conversation with her.",
    "Bearing this in mind.",
    "Inspector Neele started his first conversational\nessay.",
    "Its very kind of you to see me madam he said.",
    "My name is Neele.",
    "Ive come to see you about a Mr Fortescue who has recently died.",
    "A Mr\nRex Fortescue.",
    "I expect you know the name.",
    "Mrs MacKenzies eyes were fixed on her book.",
    "She said\n\nI dont know what youre talking about.",
    "Mr Fortescue madam.",
    "Mr Rex Fortescue.",
    "No said Mrs MacKenzie.",
    "No.",
    "Certainly not.",
    "Inspector Neele was slightly taken aback.",
    "He wondered whether this\nwas what Doctor Crosbie called being completely normal.",
    "I think Mrs MacKenzie you knew him a good many years ago.",
    "Not really said Mrs MacKenzie.",
    "It was yesterday.",
    "I see said Inspector Neele falling back upon his formula rather\nuncertainly.",
    "I believe he went on that you paid him a visit many\nyears ago at his residence Yewtree Lodge.",
    "A very ostentatious house said Mrs MacKenzie.",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes you might call it that.",
    "He had been connected with your\nhusband I believe over a certain mine in Africa.",
    "The Blackbird Mine I\nbelieve it was called.",
    "I have to read my book said Mrs MacKenzie.",
    "Theres not much time\nand I have to read my book.",
    "Yes madam.",
    "Yes I quite see that.",
    "There was a pause then Inspector\nNeele went on Mr MacKenzie and Mr Fortescue went out together to\nAfrica to survey the mine.",
    "It was my husbands mine said Mrs MacKenzie.",
    "He found it and\nstaked a claim to it.",
    "He wanted money to capitalise it.",
    "He went to Rex\nFortescue.",
    "If Id been wiser if Id known more I wouldnt have let him\ndo it.",
    "No I see that.",
    "As it was they went out together to Africa and there\nyour husband died of fever.",
    "I must read my book said Mrs MacKenzie.",
    "Do you think Mr Fortescue swindled your husband over the Blackbird\nMine Mrs MacKenzie\n\nWithout raising her eyes from the book Mrs MacKenzie said\n\nHow stupid you are.",
    "Yes yes I dare say...",
    "But you see its all a long time ago and making\ninquiries about a thing that is over a long time ago is rather difficult.",
    "Who said it was over\n\nI see.",
    "You dont think it is over\n\nNo question is ever settled until it is settled right.",
    "Kipling said that.",
    "Nobody reads Kipling nowadays but he was a great man.",
    "Do you think the question will be settled right one of these days\n\nRex Fortescue is dead isnt he You said so.",
    "He was poisoned said Inspector Neele.",
    "Rather disconcertingly Mrs MacKenzie laughed.",
    "What nonsense she said he died of fever.",
    "Im talking about Mr Rex Fortescue.",
    "So am I.",
    "She looked up suddenly and her pale blue eyes fixed his.",
    "Come now she said he died in his bed didnt he He died in his\nbed\n\nHe died in St Judes Hospital said Inspector Neele.",
    "Nobody knows where my husband died said Mrs MacKenzie.",
    "Nobody knows how he died or where he was buried... All anyone\nknows is what Rex Fortescue said.",
    "And Rex Fortescue was a liar\n\nDo you think there may have been foul play\n\nFoul play foul play fowls lay eggs dont they\n\nYou think that Rex Fortescue was responsible for your husbands\ndeath\n\nI had an egg for breakfast this morning said Mrs MacKenzie.",
    "Quite\nfresh too.",
    "Surprising isnt it when one thinks that it was thirty years\nago\n\nNeele drew a deep breath.",
    "It seemed unlikely that he was ever going to\nget anywhere at this rate but he persevered.",
    "Somebody put dead blackbirds on Rex Fortescues desk about a\nmonth or two before he died.",
    "Thats interesting.",
    "Thats very very interesting.",
    "Have you any idea madam who might have done that\n\n\fIdeas arent any help to one.",
    "One has to have action.",
    "I brought them\nup for that you know to take action.",
    "Youre talking about your children\n\nShe nodded her head rapidly.",
    "Yes.",
    "Donald and Ruby.",
    "They were nine and seven and left without a\nfather.",
    "I told them.",
    "I told them every day.",
    "I made them swear it every\nnight.",
    "Inspector Neele leant forward.",
    "What did you make them swear\n\nThat theyd kill him of course.",
    "I see.",
    "Inspector Neele spoke as though it was the most reasonable remark in\nthe world.",
    "Did they\n\nDonald went to Dunkirk.",
    "He never came back.",
    "They sent me a wire\nsaying he was dead Deeply regret killed in action.",
    "Action you see\nthe wrong kind of action.",
    "Im sorry to hear that madam.",
    "What about your daughter\n\n\fI havent got a daughter said Mrs MacKenzie.",
    "You spoke of her just now said Neele.",
    "Your daughter Ruby.",
    "Ruby.",
    "Yes Ruby.",
    "She leaned forward.",
    "Do you know what Ive done\nto Ruby\n\nNo madam.",
    "What have you done to her\n\nShe whispered suddenly\n\nLook here at the Book.",
    "He saw then that what she was holding in her lap was a Bible.",
    "It was a\nvery old Bible and as she opened it on the front page Inspector Neele\nsaw that various names had been written.",
    "It was obviously a family\nBible in which the oldfashioned custom had been continued of\nentering each new birth.",
    "Mrs MacKenzies thin forefinger pointed to\nthe two last names.",
    "Donald MacKenzie with the date of his birth and\nRuby MacKenzie with the date of hers.",
    "But a thick line was drawn\nthrough Ruby MacKenzies name.",
    "You see said Mrs MacKenzie.",
    "I struck her out of the Book.",
    "I cut her\noff for ever The Recording Angel wont find her name there.",
    "You cut her name out of the book Now why madam\n\nMrs MacKenzie looked at him cunningly.",
    "You know why she said.",
    "But I dont.",
    "Really madam I dont.",
    "She didnt keep faith.",
    "You know she didnt keep faith.",
    "Where is your daughter now madam\n\nIve told you.",
    "I have no daughter.",
    "There isnt such a person as Ruby\nMacKenzie any longer.",
    "You mean shes dead\n\nDead The woman laughed suddenly.",
    "It would be better for her if\nshe were dead.",
    "Much better.",
    "Much much better.",
    "She sighed and\nturned restlessly in her seat.",
    "Then her manner reverting to a kind of\nformal courtesy she said Im so sorry but really Im afraid I cant talk\nto you any longer.",
    "You see the time is getting very short and I must\nread my book.",
    "To Inspector Neeles further remarks Mrs MacKenzie returned no\nreply.",
    "She merely made a faint gesture of annoyance and continued to\nread her Bible with her finger following the line of the verse she was\nreading.",
    "Neele got up and left.",
    "He had another brief interview with the\nSuperintendent.",
    "Do any other relations come to see her he asked.",
    "A daughter for\ninstance\n\n\fI believe a daughter did come to see her in my predecessors time\nbut her visit agitated the patient so much that he advised her not to\ncome again.",
    "Since then everything is arranged through solicitors.",
    "And youve no idea where this Ruby MacKenzie is now\n\nThe Superintendent shook his head.",
    "No idea whatsoever.",
    "Youve no idea whether shes married for instance\n\nI dont know all I can do is to give you the address of the solicitors\nwho deal with us.",
    "Inspector Neele had already tracked down those solicitors.",
    "They were\nunable or said they were unable to tell him anything.",
    "A trust fund had\nbeen established for Mrs MacKenzie which they managed.",
    "These\narrangements had been made some years previously and they had not\nseen Miss MacKenzie since.",
    "Inspector Neele tried to get a description of Ruby MacKenzie but the\nresults were not encouraging.",
    "So many relations came to visit patients\nthat after a lapse of years they were bound to be remembered dimly\nwith the appearance of one mixed up with the appearance of another.",
    "The Matron who had been there for many years seemed to remember\nthat Miss MacKenzie was small and dark.",
    "The only other nurse who\nhad been there for any length of time recalled that she was heavily\nbuilt and fair.",
    "So there we are sir said Inspector Neele as he reported to the\nAssistant Commissioner.",
    "Theres a whole crazy set up and it fits\ntogether.",
    "It must mean something.",
    "The A.C. nodded thoughtfully.",
    "The blackbirds in the pie tying up with the Blackbird Mine rye in the\ndead mans pocket bread and honey with Adele Fortescues tea  not\nthat that is conclusive.",
    "After all anyone might have had bread and\nhoney for tea The third murder that girl strangled with a clothes line\nand a clothes peg nipped on her nose.",
    "Yes crazy as the set up is it\ncertainly cant be ignored.",
    "Half a minute sir said Inspector Neele.",
    "What is it\n\nNeele was frowning.",
    "You know what youve just said.",
    "It didnt ring true.",
    "It was wrong\nsomewhere.",
    "He shook his head and sighed.",
    "No.",
    "I cant place it.",
    "Chapter 21\n\nLance and Pat wandered round the well kept grounds surrounding\nYewtree Lodge.",
    "I hope Im not hurting your feelings Lance Pat murmured if I say\nthis is quite the nastiest garden Ive ever been in.",
    "It wont hurt my feelings said Lance.",
    "Is it Really I dont know.",
    "It\nseems to have three gardeners working on it very industriously.",
    "Pat said\n\nProbably thats whats wrong with it.",
    "No expense spared no signs of\nany individual taste.",
    "All the right rhododendrons and all the right\nbedding out done in the proper season I expect.",
    "Well what would you put in an English garden Pat if you had one\n\nMy garden said Pat would have hollyhocks larkspurs and\nCanterbury bells no bedding out and none of these horrible yews.",
    "She glanced up at the dark yew hedges disparagingly.",
    "Association of ideas said Lance easily.",
    "Theres something awfully frightening about a poisoner said Pat.",
    "I\nmean it must be a horrid brooding revengeful mind.",
    "So thats how you see it Funny I just think of it as businesslike and\ncoldblooded.",
    "I suppose one could look at it that way.",
    "She resumed with a slight\nshiver All the same to do three murders... Whoever did it must be\nmad.",
    "Yes said Lance in a low voice.",
    "Im afraid so.",
    "Then breaking out\nsharply he said For Gods sake.",
    "Pat do go away from here.",
    "Go back\nto London.",
    "Go down to Devonshire or up to the Lakes.",
    "Go to StratfordonAvon or go and look at the Norfolk Broads.",
    "The police wouldnt\nmind your going  you had nothing to do with all this.",
    "You were in Paris\nwhen the old man was killed and in London when the other two died.",
    "I\ntell you it worries me to death to have you here.",
    "Pat paused a moment before saying quietly\n\nYou know who it is dont you\n\nNo I dont.",
    "But you think you know... Thats why youre frightened for me...",
    "I wish\nyoud tell me.",
    "I cant tell you.",
    "I dont know anything.",
    "But I wish to God youd go away\nfrom here.",
    "Darling said Pat Im not going.",
    "Im staying here.",
    "For better for\nworse.",
    "Thats how I feel about it.",
    "She added with a sudden catch in\nher voice Only with me its always for worse.",
    "What on earth do you mean Pat\n\nI bring bad luck.",
    "Thats what I mean.",
    "I bring bad luck to anybody I\ncome in contact with.",
    "My dear adorable nitwit you havent brought bad luck to me.",
    "Look\nhow after I married you the old man sent for me to come home and\nmake friends with him.",
    "Yes and what happened when you did come home I tell you Im\nunlucky to people.",
    "Look here my sweet youve got a thing about all this.",
    "Its\nsuperstition pure and simple.",
    "I cant help it.",
    "Some people do bring bad luck.",
    "Im one of them.",
    "Lance took her by the shoulders and shook her violently.",
    "Youre my\nPat and to be married to you is the greatest luck in the world.",
    "So get\nthat into your silly head.",
    "Then calming down he said in a more sober\nvoice But seriously.",
    "Pat do be very careful.",
    "If there is someone\nunhinged round here I dont want you to be the one who stops the\nbullet or drinks the henbane.",
    "Or drinks the henbane as you say.",
    "When Im not around stick to that old lady.",
    "Whatshername Marple.",
    "Why do you think Aunt Effie asked her to stay here\n\nGoodness knows why Aunt Effie does anything.",
    "Lance how long are\nwe going to stay here\n\nLance shrugged his shoulders.",
    "Difficult to say.",
    "I dont think said Pat that were really awfully welcome.",
    "She\nhesitated as she spoke the words.",
    "The house belongs to your brother\nnow I suppose He doesnt really want us here does he\n\nLance chuckled suddenly.",
    "Not he but hes got to stick us for the present at any rate.",
    "And afterwards What are we going to do Lance Are we going back\nto East Africa or what\n\nIs that what youd like to do Pat\n\nShe nodded vigorously.",
    "Thats lucky said Lance because its what Id like to do too.",
    "I dont\ntake much to this country nowadays.",
    "Pats face brightened.",
    "How lovely.",
    "From what you said the other day I was afraid you might\nwant to stop here.",
    "A devilish glint appeared in Lances eyes.",
    "Youre to hold your tongue about our plans Pat he said.",
    "I have it in\nmy mind to twist my dear brother Percivals tail a bit.",
    "Oh Lance do be careful.",
    "Ill be careful my sweet but I dont see why old Percy should get\naway with everything.",
    "II\n\nWith her head a little on one side looking like an amiable cockatoo\nMiss Marple sat in the large drawingroom listening to Mrs Percival\nFortescue.",
    "Miss Marple looked particularly incongruous in the\ndrawingroom.",
    "Her light spare figure was alien to the vast brocaded\nsofa in which she sat with its manyhued cushions strewn round her.",
    "Miss Marple sat very upright because she had been taught to use a\nbackboard as a girl and not to loll.",
    "In a large armchair beside her\ndressed in elaborate black was Mrs Percival talking away volubly at\nnineteen to the dozen.",
    "Exactly thought Miss Marple like poor Mrs\nEmmett the bank managers wife.",
    "She remembered how one day Mrs\nEmmett had come to call and talk about the selling arrangements for\nPoppy Day and how after the preliminary business had been settled\nMrs Emmett had suddenly begun to talk and talk and talk.",
    "Mrs Emmett\noccupied rather a difficult position in St Mary Mead.",
    "She did not belong\nto the old guard of ladies in reduced circumstances who lived in neat\nhouses round\n\nthe\n\nchurch and who knew intimately all the\n\nramifications of the county families even though they might not be\nstrictly county themselves.",
    "Mr Emmett the bank manager had\nundeniably married beneath him and the result was that his wife was in\na position of great loneliness since she could not of course associate\nwith the wives of the trades people.",
    "Snobbery here raised its hideous\nhead and marooned Mrs Emmett on a permanent island of loneliness.",
    "The necessity to talk grew upon Mrs Emmett and on that particular\nday it had burst its bounds and Miss Marple had received the full flood\nof the torrent.",
    "She had been sorry for Mrs Emmett then and today she\nwas rather sorry for Mrs Percival Fortescue.",
    "Mrs Percival had had a lot of grievances to bear and the relief of airing\nthem to a more or less total stranger was enormous.",
    "Of course I never want to complain said Mrs Percival.",
    "Ive never\nbeen of the complaining kind.",
    "What I always say is that one must put\nup with things.",
    "What cant be cured must be endured and Im sure Ive\nnever said a word to anyone.",
    "Its really difficult to know who I could\nhave spoken to.",
    "In some ways one is very isolated here  very isolated.",
    "Its very convenient of course and a great saving of expense to have\nour own set of rooms in this house.",
    "But of course its not at all like\nhaving a place of your own.",
    "Im sure you agree.",
    "Miss Marple said she agreed.",
    "Fortunately our new house is almost ready to move into.",
    "It is a\nquestion really of getting the painters and decorators out.",
    "These men\nare so slow.",
    "My husband of course has been quite satisfied living\nhere.",
    "But then its different for a man.",
    "Thats what I always say  its so\ndifferent for a man.",
    "Dont you agree\n\nMiss Marple agreed that it was very different for a man.",
    "She could say\nthis without a qualm as it was what she really believed.",
    "The\ngentlemen were in Miss Marples mind in a totally different category\nto her own sex.",
    "They required two eggs plus bacon for breakfast three\n\n\fgood nourishing meals a day and were never to be contradicted or\nargued with before dinner.",
    "Mrs Percival went on\n\nMy husband you see is away all day in the city.",
    "When he comes home\nhes just tired and wants to sit down and read.",
    "But I on the contrary\nam alone here all day with no congenial company at all.",
    "Ive been\nperfectly comfortable and all that.",
    "Excellent food.",
    "But what I do feel\none needs is a really pleasant social circle.",
    "The people round here are\nreally not my kind.",
    "Part of them are what I call a flashy bridgeplaying\nlot.",
    "Not nice bridge.",
    "I like a hand at bridge myself as well as anyone\nbut of course theyre all very rich down here.",
    "They play for enormously\nhigh stakes and theres a great deal of drinking.",
    "In fact the sort of life\nthat I call really fast society.",
    "Then of course theres a sprinkling of well you can only call them old pussies who love to potter round with a\ntrowel and do gardening.",
    "Miss Marple looked slightly guilty since she was herself an inveterate\ngardener.",
    "I dont want to say anything against the dead resumed Mrs Percy\nrapidly but theres no doubt about it Mr Fortescue my fatherinlaw\nI mean made a very foolish second marriage.",
    "My  well I cant call her\nmy motherinlaw she was the same age as I am.",
    "The real truth of it is\nshe was manmad.",
    "Absolutely manmad.",
    "And the way she spent\nmoney My fatherinlaw was an absolute fool about her.",
    "Didnt care\nwhat bills she ran up.",
    "It vexed Percy very much very much indeed.",
    "Percy is always so careful about money matters.",
    "He hates waste.",
    "And\nthen what with Mr Fortescue being so peculiar and so bad tempered\nflashing out in these terrible rages spending money like water backing\nwildcat schemes.",
    "Well  it wasnt at all nice.",
    "Miss Marple ventured upon making a remark.",
    "That must have worried your husband too\n\nOh yes it did.",
    "For the last year Percys been very worried indeed.",
    "Its\nreally made him quite different.",
    "His manner you know changed even\ntowards me.",
    "Sometimes when I talked to him he used not to answer.",
    "Mrs Percy sighed then went on Then Elaine my sisterinlaw you\nknow shes a very odd sort of girl.",
    "Very out of doors and all that.",
    "Not\nexactly unfriendly but not sympathetic you know.",
    "She never wanted\nto go up to London and shop or go to a matin\u00e9e or anything of that\nkind.",
    "She wasnt even interested in clothes.",
    "Mrs Percival sighed again\nand murmured But of course I dont want to complain in any way.",
    "A\nqualm of compunction came over her.",
    "She said hurriedly You must\nthink it most odd talking to you like this when you are a comparative\nstranger.",
    "But really what with all the strain and shock  I think really\nits the shock that matters most.",
    "Delayed shock.",
    "I feel so nervous you\nknow that I really  well I really must speak to someone.",
    "You remind\nme so much of a dear old lady Miss Trefusis James.",
    "She fractured her\nfemur when she was seventyfive.",
    "It was a very long business nursing\nher and we became great friends.",
    "She gave me a fox fur cape when I\nleft and I did think it was kind of her.",
    "I know just how you feel said Miss Marple.",
    "And this again was true.",
    "Mrs Percivals husband was obviously bored\nby her and paid very little attention to her and the poor woman had\nmanaged to make no local friends.",
    "Running up to London and\n\n\fshopping matin\u00e9es and a luxurious house to live in did not make up for\nthe lack of humanity in her relations with her husbands family.",
    "I hope its not rude of me to say so said Miss Marple in a gentle old\nladys voice but I really feel that the late Mr Fortescue cannot have\nbeen a very nice man.",
    "He wasnt said his daughterinlaw.",
    "Quite frankly my dear between\nyou and me he was a detestable old man.",
    "I dont wonder  I really dont\n that someone put him out of the way.",
    "Youve no idea at all who  began Miss Marple and broke off.",
    "Oh\ndear perhaps this is a question I should not ask  not even an idea who\n who  well who it might have been\n\nOh I think it was that horrible man Crump said Mrs Percival.",
    "Ive\nalways disliked him very much.",
    "Hes got a manner not really rude you\nknow but yet it is rude.",
    "Impertinent thats more it.",
    "Still there would have to be a motive I suppose.",
    "I really dont know that that sort of person requires much motive.",
    "I\ndare say Mr Fortescue ticked him off about something and I rather\nsuspect that sometimes he drinks too much.",
    "But what I really think is\nthat hes a bit unbalanced you know.",
    "Like that footman or butler\nwhoever it was who went round the house shooting everybody.",
    "Of\ncourse to be quite honest with you I did suspect that it was Adele who\npoisoned Mr Fortescue.",
    "But now of course one cant suspect that\nsince shes been poisoned herself.",
    "She may have accused Crump you\nknow.",
    "And then he lost his head and perhaps managed to put\n\n\fsomething in the sandwiches and Gladys saw him do it and so he killed\nher too  I think its really dangerous having him in the house at all.",
    "Oh\ndear I wish I could get away but I suppose these horrible policemen\nwont let one do anything of the kind.",
    "She leant forward impulsively\nand put a plump hand on Miss Marples arm.",
    "Sometimes I feel I must\nget away  that if it doesnt all stop soon I shall  I shall actually run\naway.",
    "She leant back studying Miss Marples face.",
    "But perhaps  that wouldnt be wise\n\nNo  I dont think it would be very wise  the police could soon find you\nyou know.",
    "Could they Could they really You think theyre clever enough for\nthat\n\nIt is very foolish to underestimate the police.",
    "Inspector Neele strikes\nme as a particularly intelligent man.",
    "Oh I thought he was rather stupid.",
    "Miss Marple shook her head.",
    "I cant help feeling  Jennifer Fortescue hesitated  that its\ndangerous to stay here.",
    "Dangerous for you you mean\n\n\fYees  well yes \n\nBecause of something you  know\n\nMrs Percival seemed to take breath.",
    "Oh no  of course I dont know anything.",
    "What should I know Its just just that Im nervous.",
    "That man Crump \n\nBut it was not Miss Marple thought of Crump that Mrs Percival\nFortescue was thinking  watching the clenching and unclenching of\nJennifers hands.",
    "Miss Marple thought that for some reason Jennifer\nFortescue was very badly frightened indeed.",
    "Chapter 22\n\nIt was growing dark.",
    "Miss Marple had taken her knitting over to the\nwindow in the library.",
    "Looking out of the glass pane she saw Pat\nFortescue walking up and down the terrace outside.",
    "Miss Marple\nunlatched the window and called through it.",
    "Come in my dear.",
    "Do come in.",
    "Im sure its much too cold and damp\nfor you to be out there without a coat on.",
    "Pat obeyed the summons.",
    "She came in and shut the window and\nturned on two of the lamps.",
    "Yes she said its not a very nice afternoon.",
    "She sat down on the\nsofa by Miss Marple What are you knitting\n\n\fOh just a little matin\u00e9e coat dear.",
    "For a baby you know.",
    "I always say\nyoung mothers cant have too many matin\u00e9e coats for their babies.",
    "Its\nthe second size.",
    "I always knit the second size.",
    "Babies so soon grow\nout of the first size.",
    "Pat stretched out long legs towards the fire.",
    "Its nice in here today she said.",
    "With the fire and the lamps and you\nknitting things for babies.",
    "It all seems cosy and homely and like\nEngland ought to be.",
    "Its like England is said Miss Marple.",
    "There are not so many\nYewtree Lodges my dear.",
    "I think thats a good thing said Pat.",
    "I dont believe this was ever a\nhappy house.",
    "I dont believe anybody was ever happy in it in spite of\nall the money they spent and the things they had.",
    "No Miss Marple agreed.",
    "I shouldnt say it had been a happy house.",
    "I suppose Adele may have been happy said Pat.",
    "I never met her of\ncourse so I dont know but Jennifer is pretty miserable and Elaines\nbeen eating her heart out over a young man whom she probably knows\nin her heart of hearts doesnt care for her.",
    "Oh how I want to get away\nfrom here She looked at Miss Marple and smiled suddenly.",
    "Dyou\nknow she said that Lance told me to stick as close to you as I could.",
    "He seemed to think I should be safe that way.",
    "Your husbands no fool said Miss Marple.",
    "No.",
    "Lance isnt a fool.",
    "At least he is in some ways.",
    "But I wish hed tell\nme exactly what hes afraid of.",
    "One thing seems clear enough.",
    "Somebody in this house is mad and madness is always frightening\nbecause you dont know how mad peoples minds will work.",
    "You dont\nknow what theyll do next.",
    "My poor child said Miss Marple.",
    "Oh Im all right really.",
    "I ought to be tough enough by now.",
    "Miss Marple said gently\n\nYouve had a good deal of unhappiness havent you my dear\n\nOh Ive had some very good times too.",
    "I had a lovely childhood in\nIreland riding hunting and a great big bare draughty house with lots\nand lots of sun in it.",
    "If youve had a happy childhood nobody can take\nthat away from you can they It was afterwards  when I grew up  that\nthings seemed always to go wrong.",
    "To begin with I suppose it was the\nwar.",
    "Your husband was a fighter pilot wasnt he\n\nYes.",
    "Wed only been married about a month when Don was shot\ndown.",
    "She stared ahead other into the fire.",
    "I thought at first I wanted\nto die too.",
    "It seemed so unfair so cruel.",
    "And yet  in the end  I almost\nbegan to see that it had been the best thing.",
    "Don was wonderful in the\nwar.",
    "Brave and reckless and gay.",
    "He had all the qualities that are\nneeded wanted in a war.",
    "But I dont believe somehow peace would\nhave suited him.",
    "He had a kind of  oh how shall I put it  arrogant\n\n\finsubordination.",
    "He wouldnt have fitted in or settled down.",
    "Hed have\nfought against things.",
    "He was  well antisocial in a way.",
    "No he\nwouldnt have fitted in.",
    "Its wise of you to see that my dear.",
    "Miss Marple bent over her\nknitting picked up a stitch counted under her breath Three plain\ntwo purl slip one knit two together and then said aloud And your\nsecond husband my dear\n\nFreddy Freddy shot himself.",
    "Oh dear.",
    "How very sad.",
    "What a tragedy.",
    "We were very happy together said Pat.",
    "I began to realise about\ntwo years after we were married that Freddy wasnt  well wasnt\nalways straight.",
    "I began to find out the sort of things that were going\non.",
    "But it didnt seem to matter between us two that is.",
    "Because you\nsee Freddy loved me and I loved him.",
    "I tried not to know what was\ngoing on.",
    "That was cowardly of me I suppose but I couldnt have\nchanged him you know.",
    "You cant change people.",
    "No said Miss Marple you cant change people.",
    "Id taken him and loved him and married him for what he was and I\nsort of felt that I just had to  put up with it.",
    "Then things went wrong and\nhe couldnt face it and he shot himself.",
    "After he died I went out to\nKenya to stay with some friends there.",
    "I couldnt stop on in England\nand go on meeting all  all the old crowd that knew about it all.",
    "And out\nin Kenya I met Lance.",
    "Her face changed and softened.",
    "She went on\nlooking into the fire and Miss Marple looked at her.",
    "Presently Pat\n\n\fturned her head and said.",
    "Tell me Miss Marple what do you really\nthink of Percival\n\nWell Ive not seen very much of him.",
    "Just at breakfast usually.",
    "Thats\nall.",
    "I dont think he very much likes my being here.",
    "Pat laughed suddenly.",
    "Hes mean you know.",
    "Terribly mean about money.",
    "Lance says he\nalways was.",
    "Jennifer complains of it too.",
    "Goes over the housekeeping\naccounts with Miss Dove.",
    "Complaining of every item.",
    "But Miss Dove\nmanages to hold her own.",
    "Shes really rather a wonderful person.",
    "Dont you think so\n\nYes indeed.",
    "She reminds me of Mrs Latimer in my own village St\nMary Mead.",
    "She ran the W.V.S.",
    "you know and the Girl Guides and\nindeed she ran practically everything there.",
    "It wasnt for quite five\nyears that we discovered that  oh but I mustnt gossip.",
    "Nothing is\nmore boring than people talking to you about places and people whom\nyouve never seen and know nothing about.",
    "You must forgive me my\ndear.",
    "Is St Mary Mead a very nice village\n\nWell I dont know what you would call a nice village my dear.",
    "Its\nquite a pretty village.",
    "There are some nice people living in it and some\nextremely unpleasant people as well.",
    "Very curious things go on there\njust as in any other village.",
    "Human nature is much the same\neverywhere is it not\n\n\fYou go up and see Miss Ramsbottom a good deal dont you said\nPat.",
    "Now she really frightens me.",
    "Frightens you Why\n\nBecause I think shes crazy.",
    "I think shes got religious mania.",
    "You\ndont think she could be  really  mad do you\n\nIn what way mad\n\nOh you know what I mean Miss Marple well enough.",
    "She sits up\nthere and never goes out and broods about sin.",
    "Well she might have\nfelt in the end that it was her mission in life to execute judgment.",
    "Is that what your husband thinks\n\nI dont know what Lance thinks.",
    "He wont tell me.",
    "But Im quite sure of\none thing  that he believes that its someone whos mad and its\nsomeone in the family.",
    "Well Percivals sane enough I should say.",
    "Jennifers just stupid and rather pathetic.",
    "Shes a bit nervy but thats\nall and Elaine is one of these queer tempestuous tense girls.",
    "Shes\ndesperately in love with this young man of hers and shell never admit\nto herself for a moment that hes marrying her for her money.",
    "You think he is marrying her for money\n\nYes I do.",
    "Dont you think so\n\nI should say quite certainly said Miss Marple.",
    "Like young Ellis who\nmarried Marion Bates the rich ironmongers daughter.",
    "She was a very\n\n\fplain girl and absolutely besotted about him.",
    "However it turned out\nquite well.",
    "People like young Ellis and this Gerald Wright are only really\ndisagreeable when theyve married a poor girl for love.",
    "They are so\nannoyed with themselves for doing it that they take it out of the girl.",
    "But if they marry a rich girl they continue to respect her.",
    "I dont see went on Pat frowning how it can be anybody from\noutside.",
    "And so  and so that accounts for the atmosphere that is here.",
    "Everyone watching everybody else.",
    "Only somethings got to happen\nsoon \n\nThere wont be any more deaths said Miss Marple.",
    "At least I\nshouldnt think so.",
    "You cant be sure of that.",
    "Well as a matter of fact I am fairly sure.",
    "The murderers\naccomplished his purpose you see.",
    "His\n\nWell his or her.",
    "One says his for convenience.",
    "You say his or her purpose.",
    "What sort of purpose\n\nMiss Marple shook her head  she was not yet quite sure herself.",
    "Chapter 23\n\n\fOnce again Miss Somers had just made tea in the typists room and\nonce again the kettle had not been boiling when Miss Somers poured\nthe water on to the tea.",
    "History repeats itself.",
    "Miss Griffith accepting\nher cup thought to herself I really must speak to Mr Percival about\nSomers.",
    "Im sure we can do better.",
    "But with all this terrible business\ngoing on one doesnt like to bother him over office details.",
    "As so often before.",
    "Miss Griffith said sharply\n\nWater not boiling again Somers and Miss Somers going pink\nreplied in her usual formula\n\nOh dear I was sure it was boiling this time.",
    "Further developments on the same line were interrupted by the\nentrance of Lance Fortescue.",
    "He looked round him somewhat vaguely\nand Miss Griffith jumping up came forward to meet him.",
    "Mr Lance she exclaimed.",
    "He swung round towards her and his face lit up in a smile.",
    "Hallo.",
    "Why its Miss Griffith.",
    "Miss Griffith was delighted.",
    "Eleven years since he had seen her and he\nknew her name.",
    "She said in a confused voice\n\nFancy your remembering.",
    "And Lance said easily with all his charm to the fore\n\n\fOf course I remember.",
    "A flicker of excitement was running round the typists room.",
    "Miss\nSomerss troubles over the tea were forgotten.",
    "She was gaping at\nLance with her mouth slightly open.",
    "Miss Bell gazed eagerly over the\ntop of her typewriter and Miss Chase unobtrusively drew out her\ncompact and powdered her nose.",
    "Lance Fortescue looked round him.",
    "So everythings still going on just the same here he said.",
    "Not many changes Mr Lance.",
    "How brown you look and how well I\nsuppose you must have had a very interesting life abroad.",
    "You could call it that said Lance but perhaps I am now going to try\nand have an interesting life in London.",
    "Youre coming back here to the office\n\nMaybe.",
    "Oh but how delightful.",
    "Youll find me very rusty said Lance.",
    "Youll have to show me all the\nropes Miss Griffith.",
    "Miss Griffith laughed delightedly.",
    "It will be very nice to have you back Mr Lance.",
    "Very nice indeed.",
    "Lance threw her an appreciative glance.",
    "Thats sweet of you he said thats very sweet of you.",
    "We never believed  none of us thought... Miss Griffith broke off and\nflushed.",
    "Lance patted her on the arm.",
    "You didnt believe the devil was as black as he was painted Well\nperhaps he wasnt.",
    "But thats all old history now.",
    "Theres no good\ngoing back over it.",
    "The futures the thing.",
    "He added Is my brother\nhere\n\nHes in the inner office I think.",
    "Lance nodded easily and passed on.",
    "In the anteroom to the inner\nsanctum a hardfaced woman of middle age rose behind a desk and\nsaid forbiddingly\n\nYour name and business please\n\nLance looked at her doubtfully.",
    "Are you  Miss Grosvenor he asked.",
    "Miss Grosvenor had been described to him as a glamorous blonde.",
    "She had indeed appeared so in the pictures that had appeared in the\nnewspapers reporting the inquest on Rex Fortescue.",
    "This surely\ncould not be Miss Grosvenor.",
    "Miss Grosvenor left last week.",
    "I am Mrs Hardcastle Mr Percival\nFortescues personal secretary.",
    "How like old Percy thought Lance.",
    "To get rid of a glamorous blonde\nand take on a Gorgon instead.",
    "I wonder why Was it safety or was it\nbecause this one comes cheaper\n\nAloud he said easily\n\nIm Lancelot Fortescue.",
    "You havent met me yet.",
    "Oh Im so sorry Mr Lancelot Mrs Hardcastle apologised this is the\nfirst time I think youve been to the office\n\nThe first time but not the last said Lance smiling.",
    "He crossed the room and opened the door of what had been his\nfathers private office.",
    "Somewhat to his surprise it was not Percival\nwho was sitting behind the desk there but Inspector Neele.",
    "Inspector\nNeele looked up from a large wad of papers which he was sorting and\nnodded his head.",
    "Good morning Mr Fortescue youve come to take up your duties I\nsuppose.",
    "So youve heard I decided to come into the firm\n\nYour brother told me so.",
    "He did did he With enthusiasm\n\nInspector Neele endeavoured to conceal a smile.",
    "The enthusiasm was not marked he said gravely.",
    "Poor Percy commented Lance.",
    "Inspector Neele looked at him curiously.",
    "Are you really going to become a City man\n\nYou dont think its likely.",
    "Inspector Neele\n\nIt doesnt seem quite in character Mr Fortescue.",
    "Why not Im my fathers son.",
    "And your mothers.",
    "Lance shook his head.",
    "You havent got anything there.",
    "Inspector.",
    "My mother was a Victorian\nromantic.",
    "Her favourite reading was the Idylls of the King as indeed\nyou may have deduced from our curious Christian names.",
    "She was an\ninvalid and always I should imagine out of touch with reality.",
    "Im not\nlike that at all.",
    "I have no sentiment very little sense of romance and Im\na realist first and last.",
    "People arent always what they think themselves to be Inspector\nNeele pointed out.",
    "No I suppose thats true said Lance.",
    "He sat down in a chair and stretched his long legs out in his own\ncharacteristic fashion.",
    "He was smiling to himself.",
    "Then he said\nunexpectedly\n\nYoure shrewder than my brother Inspector.",
    "In what way Mr Fortescue\n\nIve put the wind up Percy all right.",
    "He thinks Im all set for the City\nlife.",
    "He thinks hes going to have my fingers fiddling about in his pie.",
    "He\nthinks Ill launch out and spend the firms money and try and embroil\nhim in wildcat schemes.",
    "It would be almost worth doing just for the fun\nof it Almost but not quite.",
    "I couldnt really stand an office life\nInspector.",
    "I like the open air and some possibilities of adventure.",
    "Id\nstifle in a place like this.",
    "He added quickly This is off the record\nmind.",
    "Dont give me away to Percy will you\n\nI dont suppose the subject will arise Mr Fortescue.",
    "I must have my bit of fun with Percy said Lance.",
    "I want to make him\nsweat a bit.",
    "Ive got to get a bit of my own back.",
    "Thats rather a curious phrase Mr Fortescue said Neele.",
    "Your own\nback  for what\n\n\fLance shrugged his shoulders.",
    "Oh its old history now.",
    "Not worth going back over.",
    "There was a little matter of a cheque I understand in the past.",
    "Would\nthat be what youre referring to\n\nHow much you know Inspector\n\nThere was no question of prosecution I understand said Neele.",
    "Your father wouldnt have done that.",
    "No.",
    "He just kicked me out thats all.",
    "Inspector Neele eyed him speculatively but it was not Lance\nFortescue of whom he was thinking but of Percival.",
    "The honest\nindustrious parsimonious Percival.",
    "It seemed to him that wherever he\ngot in the case he was always coming up against the enigma of\nPercival Fortescue a man of whom everybody knew the outer aspects\nbut whose inner personality was much harder to gauge.",
    "One would\nhave said from observing him a somewhat colourless and insignificant\ncharacter a man who had been very much under his fathers thumb.",
    "Percy Prim in fact as the A.C. had once said.",
    "Neele was trying now\nthrough Lance to get at a closer appreciation of Percivals\npersonality.",
    "He murmured in a tentative manner\n\nYour brother seems always to have been very much  well how shall I\nput it  under your fathers thumb.",
    "I wonder.",
    "Lance seemed definitely to be considering the point.",
    "I\nwonder.",
    "Yes that would be the effect I think given.",
    "But Im not sure\nthat it was really the truth.",
    "Its astonishing you know when I look back\nthrough life to see how Percy always got his own way without seeming\nto do so if you know what I mean.",
    "Yes Inspector Neele thought it was indeed astonishing.",
    "He sorted\nthrough the papers in front of him fished out a letter and shoved it\nacross the desk towards Lance.",
    "This is a letter you wrote last August isnt it Mr Fortescue\n\nLance took it glanced at it and returned it.",
    "Yes he said I wrote it after I got back to Kenya last summer.",
    "Dad\nkept it did he Where was it  here in the office\n\nNo Mr Fortescue it was among your fathers papers in Yewtree\nLodge.",
    "The Inspector considered it speculatively as it lay on the desk in front\nof him.",
    "It was not a long letter.",
    "Dear Dad\n\nIve talked things over with Pat and I agree to your proposition.",
    "It will\ntake me a little time to get things fixed up here say about the end of\nOctober or beginning of November.",
    "Ill let you know nearer the time.",
    "I\nhope well pull together better than we used to do.",
    "Anyway Ill do my\nbest.",
    "I cant say more.",
    "Look after yourself.",
    "Yours\n\nLance.",
    "Where did you address this letter Mr Fortescue.",
    "To the office or\nYewtree Lodge\n\nLance frowned in an effort of recollection.",
    "Its difficult.",
    "I cant remember.",
    "You see its almost three months now.",
    "The office I think.",
    "Yes Im almost sure.",
    "Here to the office.",
    "He paused\na moment before asking with frank curiosity Why\n\nI wondered said Inspector Neele.",
    "Your father did not put it on the\nfile here among his private papers.",
    "He took it back with him to Yewtree\nLodge and I found it in his desk there.",
    "I wondered why he should have\ndone that.",
    "Lance laughed.",
    "To keep it out of Percys way I suppose.",
    "Yes said Inspector Neele it would seem so.",
    "Your brother then had\naccess to your fathers private papers here\n\nWell Lance hesitated and frowned not exactly.",
    "I mean I suppose\nhe could have looked through them at any time if he liked but he\nwouldnt be...",
    "Inspector Neele finished the sentence for him.",
    "Wouldnt be supposed to do so\n\nLance grinned broadly.",
    "Thats right.",
    "Frankly it would have been\nsnooping.",
    "But Percy I should imagine always did snoop.",
    "Inspector Neele nodded.",
    "He also thought it probable that Percival\nFortescue snooped.",
    "It would be in keeping with what the Inspector\nwas beginning to learn of his character.",
    "And talk of the devil murmured Lance as at that moment the door\nopened and Percival Fortescue came in.",
    "About to speak to the\nInspector he stopped frowning as he saw Lance.",
    "Hallo he said.",
    "You here You didnt tell me you were coming here\ntoday.",
    "I felt a kind of zeal for work coming over me said Lance so here I\nam ready to make myself useful.",
    "What do you want me to do\n\nPercival said testily\n\nNothing at present.",
    "Nothing at all.",
    "We shall have to come to some kind\nof arrangement as to what side of the business youre going to look\nafter.",
    "We shall have to arrange for an office for you.",
    "Lance inquired with a grin\n\n\fBy the way why did you get rid of glamorous Grosvenor old boy and\nreplace her by Horsefaced Hetty out there\n\nReally Lance Percival protested sharply.",
    "Definitely a change for the worse said Lance.",
    "Ive been looking\nforward to the glamorous Grosvenor.",
    "Why did you sack her Thought\nshe knew a bit too much\n\nOf course not.",
    "What an idea Percy spoke angrily a flush mounting\nhis pale face.",
    "He turned to the Inspector.",
    "You mustnt pay any\nattention to my brother he said coldly.",
    "He has a rather peculiar\nsense of humour.",
    "He added I never had a very high opinion of Miss\nGrosvenors intelligence.",
    "Mrs Hardcastle has excellent references and\nis most capable besides being very moderate in her terms.",
    "Very moderate in her terms murmured Lance casting his eyes\ntowards the ceiling.",
    "You know Percy I dont really approve of\nskimping over the office personnel.",
    "By the way considering how\nloyally the staff has stood by us during these last tragic weeks dont\nyou think we ought to raise their salaries all round\n\nCertainly not snapped Percival Fortescue.",
    "Quite uncalled for and\nunnecessary.",
    "Inspector Neele noticed the gleam of devilry in Lances eyes.",
    "Percival\nhowever was far too much upset to notice it.",
    "You always had the most extraordinarily extravagant ideas he\nstuttered.",
    "In the state in which this firm has been left economy is our\nonly hope.",
    "Inspector Neele coughed apologetically.",
    "Thats one of the things I wanted to talk to you about Mr Fortescue\nhe said to Percival.",
    "Yes Inspector Percival switched his attention to Neele.",
    "I want to put certain suggestions before you Mr Fortescue.",
    "I\nunderstand that for the past six months or longer possibly a year your\nfathers general behaviour and conduct has been a source of\nincreasing anxiety to you.",
    "He wasnt well said Percival with finality.",
    "He certainly wasnt at all\nwell.",
    "You tried to induce him to see a doctor but you failed.",
    "He refused\ncatagorically\n\nThat is so.",
    "May I ask you if you suspected that your father was suffering from\nwhat is familiarly referred to as G.P.I.",
    "General Paralysis of the Insane\na condition with signs of megalomania and irritability which terminates\nsooner or later in hopeless insanity\n\n\fPercival looked surprised.",
    "It is remarkably astute of you Inspector.",
    "That is exactly what I did fear.",
    "That is why I was so anxious for my\nfather to submit to medical treatment.",
    "Neele went on\n\nIn the meantime until you could persuade your father to do that he\nwas capable of causing a great deal of havoc to the business\n\nHe certainly was Percival agreed.",
    "A very unfortunate state of affairs said the Inspector.",
    "Quite terrible.",
    "No one knows the anxiety I have been through.",
    "Neele said gently\n\nFrom the business point of view your fathers death was an extremely\nfortunate circumstance.",
    "Percival said sharply\n\nYou can hardly think I would regard my fathers death in that light.",
    "It is not a question of how you regard it Mr Fortescue.",
    "Im speaking\nmerely of a question of fact.",
    "Your father died before his finances were\ncompletely on the rocks.",
    "Percival said impatiently\n\n\fYes yes.",
    "As a matter of actual fact you are right.",
    "It was a fortunate occurrence for your whole family since they are\ndependent on this business.",
    "Yes.",
    "But really Inspector I dont see what youre driving at... Percival\nbroke off.",
    "Oh Im not driving at anything Mr Fortescue said Neele.",
    "I just like\ngetting my facts straight.",
    "Now theres another thing.",
    "I understood you\nto say that youd had no communication of any kind with your brother\nhere since he left England many years ago.",
    "Quite so said Percival.",
    "Yes but it isnt quite so is it Mr Fortescue I mean that last spring\nwhen you were so worried about your fathers health you actually\nwrote to your brother in Africa told him of your anxiety about your\nfathers behaviour.",
    "You wanted I think your brother to combine with\nyou in getting your father medically examined and put under restraint\nif necessary.",
    "I  I  really I dont see... Percival was badly shaken.",
    "That is so isnt it Mr Fortescue\n\nWell actually I thought it only right.",
    "After all Lancelot was a junior\npartner.",
    "Inspector Neele transferred his gaze to Lance.",
    "Lance was grinning.",
    "You received that letter Inspector Neele asked.",
    "Lance Fortescue nodded.",
    "What did you reply to it\n\nLances grin widened.",
    "I told Percy to go and boil his head and to let the old man alone.",
    "I said\nthe old man probably knew what he was doing quite well.",
    "Inspector Neeles gaze went back again to Percival.",
    "Were those the terms of your brothers answer\n\nI  I  well I suppose roughly yes.",
    "Far more offensively couched\nhowever.",
    "I thought the Inspector had better have a bowdlerised version said\nLance.",
    "He went on Frankly Inspector Neele that is one of the\nreasons why when I got a letter from my father I came home to see\nfor myself what I thought.",
    "In the short interview I had with my father\nfrankly I couldnt see anything much wrong with him.",
    "He was slightly\nexcitable that was all.",
    "He appeared to me perfectly capable of\nmanaging his own affairs.",
    "Anyway after I got back to Africa and had\ntalked things over with Pat I decided that Id come home and  what\nshall we say  see fair play.",
    "He shot a glance at Percival as he spoke.",
    "I object said Percival Fortescue.",
    "I object strongly to what you are\nsuggesting.",
    "I was not intending to victimise my father I was concerned\nfor his health.",
    "I admit that I was also concerned... he paused.",
    "Lance filled the pause quickly.",
    "You were also concerned for your pocket eh For Percys little\npocket.",
    "He got up and all of a sudden his manner changed.",
    "All right\nPercy Im through.",
    "I was going to string you along a bit by pretending\nto work here.",
    "I wasnt going to let you have things all your own sweet\nway but Im damned if Im going on with it.",
    "Frankly it makes me sick to\nbe in the same room with you.",
    "Youve always been a dirty mean little\nskunk all your life.",
    "Prying and snooping and lying and making trouble.",
    "Ill tell you another thing.",
    "I cant prove it but Ive always believed it was\nyou who forged that cheque there was all the row about that got me\nshot out of here.",
    "For one thing it was a damn bad forgery a forgery\nthat drew attention to itself in letters a foot high.",
    "My record was too\nbad for me to be able to protest effectively but I often wondered that\nthe old boy didnt realise that if I had forged his name I could have\nmade a much better job of it than that.",
    "Lance swept on his voice rising Well Percy Im not going on with\nthis silly game.",
    "Im sick of this country and of the City.",
    "Im sick of little\nmen like you with their pinstripe trousers and their black coats and\ntheir mincing voices and their mean shoddy financial deals.",
    "Well\nshare out as you suggested and Ill get back with Pat to a different\ncountry  a country where theres room to breathe and move about.",
    "You can make your own division of securities.",
    "Keep the giltedged and\nthe conservative ones keep the safe 2 per cent and 3 per cent and 3\n\n\f12 per cent.",
    "Give me fathers latest wildcat speculations as you call\nthem.",
    "Most of them are probably duds.",
    "But Ill bet that one or two of\nthem will pay better in the end than all your playing safe with three per\ncent Trustee Stocks will do.",
    "Father was a shrewd old devil.",
    "He took\nchances plenty of them.",
    "Some of those chances paid five and six and\nseven hundred per cent.",
    "Ill back his judgment and his luck.",
    "As for you\nyou little worm... Lance advanced towards his brother who retreated\nrapidly round the end of the desk towards Inspector Neele.",
    "All right\nsaid Lance Im not going to touch you.",
    "You wanted me out of here\nyoure getting me out of here.",
    "You ought to be satisfied.",
    "He added as\nhe strode towards the door You can throw in the old Blackbird Mine\nconcession too if you like.",
    "If weve got the murdering MacKenzies on\nour trail Ill draw them off to Africa.",
    "He added as he swung through\nthe doorway Revenge  after all these years  scarcely seems\ncredible.",
    "But Inspector Neele seems to take it seriously dont you\nInspector\n\nNonsense said Percival.",
    "Such a thing is impossible\n\nAsk him said Lance.",
    "Ask him why hes making all these inquiries\ninto blackbirds and rye in fathers pocket.",
    "Gently stroking his upper lip Inspector Neele said\n\nYou remember the blackbirds last summer Mr Fortescue.",
    "There are\ncertain grounds for inquiry.",
    "Nonsense said Percival again.",
    "Nobodys heard of the MacKenzies\nfor years.",
    "And yet said Lance Id almost dare to swear that theres a\nMacKenzie in our midst.",
    "I rather imagine the Inspector thinks so too.",
    "II\n\nInspector Neele caught up Lancelot Fortescue as the latter emerged\ninto the street below.",
    "Lance grinned at him rather sheepishly.",
    "I didnt mean to do that he said.",
    "But I suddenly lost my temper.",
    "Oh\nwell  it would have come to the same before long.",
    "Im meeting Pat at\nthe Savoy  are you coming my way Inspector\n\nNo Im returning to Baydon Heath.",
    "But theres just something Id like\nto ask you Mr Fortescue.",
    "Yes\n\nWhen you came into the inner office and saw me there  you were\nsurprised.",
    "Why\n\nBecause I didnt expect to see you I suppose.",
    "I thought Id find\nPercival there.",
    "You werent told that hed gone out\n\nLance looked at him curiously.",
    "No.",
    "They said he was in his office.",
    "I see  nobody knew hed gone out.",
    "Theres no second door out of the\ninner office  but there is a door leading straight into the corridor from\nthe little antechamber  I suppose your brother went out that way  but\nIm surprised Mrs Hardcastle didnt tell you so.",
    "Lance laughed.",
    "Shed probably been to collect her cup of tea.",
    "Yes  yes  quite so.",
    "Lance looked at him.",
    "Whats the idea Inspector\n\nJust puzzling over a few little things thats all Mr Fortescue \n\nChapter 24\n\nIn the train on the way down to Baydon Heath Inspector Neele had\nsingularly little success doing The Times crossword.",
    "His mind was\ndistracted by various possibilities.",
    "In the same way he read the news\nwith only half his brain taking it in.",
    "He read of an earthquake in Japan\nof the discovery of uranium deposits in Tanganyika of the body of a\nmerchant seaman washed up near Southampton and of the imminent\nstrike among the dockers.",
    "He read of the latest victims of the cosh and\nof a new drug that had achieved wonders in advanced cases of\ntuberculosis.",
    "All these items made a queer kind of pattern in the back of his mind.",
    "Presently he returned to the crossword puzzle and was able to put\ndown three clues in rapid succession.",
    "When he reached Yewtree Lodge he had come to a certain decision.",
    "He said to Sergeant Hay\n\nWheres that old lady Is she still here\n\nMiss Marple Oh yes shes here still.",
    "Great buddies with the old lady\nupstairs.",
    "I see.",
    "Neele paused for a moment and then said Where is she now\nId like to see her.",
    "Miss Marple arrived in a few minutes time looking rather flushed and\nbreathing fast.",
    "You want to see me.",
    "Inspector Neele I do hope I havent kept you\nwaiting.",
    "Sergeant Hay couldnt find me at first.",
    "I was in the kitchen\ntalking to Mrs Crump.",
    "I was congratulating her on her pastry and how\nlight her hand is and telling her how delicious the souffl\u00e9 was last\nnight.",
    "I always think you know its better to approach a subject\ngradually dont you At least I suppose it isnt so easy for you.",
    "You\nmore or less have to come almost straight away to the questions you\nwant to ask.",
    "But of course for an old lady like me who has all the time\nin the world as you might say its really expected other that there\nshould be a great deal of unnecessary talk.",
    "And the way to a cooks\nheart as they say is through her pastry.",
    "What you really wanted to talk to her about said Inspector Neele\nwas Gladys Martin\n\nMiss Marple nodded.",
    "Yes.",
    "Gladys.",
    "You see Mrs Crump could really tell me a lot about the\ngirl.",
    "Not in connection with the murder.",
    "I dont mean that.",
    "But about\nher spirits lately and the odd things she said.",
    "I dont mean odd in the\nsense of peculiar.",
    "I mean just the odds and ends of conversation.",
    "Did you find it helpful asked Inspector Neele.",
    "Yes said Miss Marple.",
    "I found it very helpful indeed.",
    "I really think\nyou know that things are becoming very much clearer dont you\n\nI do and I dont said Inspector Neele.",
    "Sergeant Hay he noticed had left the room.",
    "He was glad of it because\nwhat he was about to do now was to say the least of it slightly\nunorthodox.",
    "Look here Miss Marple he said I want to talk to you seriously.",
    "Yes Inspector Neele\n\nIn a way said Inspector Neele you and I represent different points\nof view.",
    "I admit Miss Marple that Ive heard something about you at\nthe Yard.",
    "He smiled It seems youre fairly well known there.",
    "I dont know how it is fluttered Miss Marple but I so often seem to\nget mixed up in things that are really no concern of mine.",
    "Crimes I\nmean and peculiar happenings.",
    "Youve got a reputation said Inspector Neele.",
    "Sir Henry Clithering of course said Miss Marple is a very old friend\nof mine.",
    "As I said before Neele went on you and I represent opposite points\nof view.",
    "One might almost call them sanity and insanity.",
    "Miss Marple put her head a little on one side.",
    "Now what exactly do you mean by that I wonder Inspector\n\nWell Miss Marple theres a sane way of looking at things.",
    "This\nmurder benefits certain people.",
    "One person I may say in particular.",
    "The second murder benefits the same person.",
    "The third murder one\nmight call a murder for safety.",
    "But which do you call the third murder Miss Marple asked.",
    "Her eyes a very bright china blue looked shrewdly at the Inspector.",
    "He nodded.",
    "Yes.",
    "Youve got something there perhaps.",
    "You know the other day\nwhen the A.C. was speaking to me of these murders something that\nhe said seemed to me to be wrong.",
    "That was it.",
    "I was thinking of\n\n\fcourse of the nursery rhyme.",
    "The king in his countinghouse the\nqueen in the parlour and the maid hanging out the clothes.",
    "Exactly said Miss Marple.",
    "A sequence in that order but actually\nGladys must have been murdered before Mrs Fortescue mustnt she\n\nI think so said Neele.",
    "I take it its quite certainly so.",
    "Her body wasnt\ndiscovered till late that night and of course it was difficult then to say\nexactly how long shed been dead.",
    "But I think myself that she must\nalmost certainly have been murdered round about five oclock\nbecause otherwise...\n\nMiss Marple cut in.",
    "Because otherwise she would certainly have\ntaken the second tray into the drawingroom\n\nQuite so.",
    "She took one tray in with the tea on it she brought the\nsecond tray into the hall and then something happened.",
    "She saw\nsomething or she heard something.",
    "The question is what that\nsomething was.",
    "It might have been Dubois coming down the stairs\nfrom Mrs Fortescues room.",
    "It might have been Elaine Fortescues\nyoung man Gerald Wright coming in at the side door.",
    "Whoever it was\nlured her away from the teatray and out into the garden.",
    "And once\nthat had happened I dont see any possibility of her death being long\ndelayed.",
    "It was cold out and she was only wearing her thin uniform.",
    "Of course youre quite right said Miss Marple.",
    "I mean it was never a\ncase of the maid was in the garden hanging out the clothes.",
    "She\nwouldnt be hanging up clothes at that time of the evening and she\nwouldnt go out to the clothes line without putting a coat on.",
    "That was\n\n\fall camouflage like the clothes peg to make the thing fit in with the\nrhyme.",
    "Exactly said Inspector Neele crazy.",
    "Thats where I cant yet see\neye to eye with you.",
    "I cant  I simply cant swallow the nursery rhyme\nbusiness.",
    "But it fits Inspector.",
    "You must agree it fits.",
    "It fits said Neele heavily but all the same the sequence is wrong.",
    "I\nmean the rhyme definitely suggests that the maid was the third\nmurder.",
    "But we know that the Queen was the third murder.",
    "Adele\nFortescue was not killed until between twentyfivepast five and five\nminutes to six.",
    "By then Gladys must already have been dead.",
    "And thats all wrong isnt it said Miss Marple.",
    "All wrong for the\nnursery rhyme  thats very significant isnt it\n\nInspector Neele shrugged his shoulders.",
    "Its probably splitting hairs.",
    "The deaths fulfil the conditions of the\nrhyme and I suppose thats all that was needed.",
    "But Im talking now as\nthough I were on your side.",
    "Im going to outline my side of the case\nnow Miss Marple.",
    "Im washing out the blackbirds and the rye and all\nthe rest of it.",
    "Im going by sober facts and common sense and the\nreasons for which sane people do murders.",
    "First the death of Rex\nFortescue and who benefits by his death.",
    "Well it benefits quite a lot of\npeople but most of all it benefits his son Percival.",
    "His son Percival\nwasnt at Yewtree Lodge that morning.",
    "He couldnt have put poison in\n\n\fhis fathers coffee or in anything that he ate for breakfast.",
    "Or thats\nwhat we thought at first.",
    "Ah Miss Marples eyes brightened.",
    "So there was a method was\nthere Ive been thinking about it you know a good deal and Ive had\nseveral ideas.",
    "But of course no evidence or proof.",
    "Theres no harm in my letting you know said Inspector Neele.",
    "Taxine was added to a new jar of marmalade.",
    "That jar of marmalade\nwas placed on the breakfast table and the top layer of it was eaten by\nMr Fortescue at breakfast.",
    "Later that jar of marmalade was thrown out\ninto the bushes and a similar jar with a similar amount taken out of it\nwas placed in the pantry.",
    "The jar in the bushes was found and Ive just\nhad the result of the analysis.",
    "It shows definite evidence of taxine.",
    "So that was it murmured Miss Marple.",
    "So simple and easy to do.",
    "Consolidated Investments Neele went on was in a bad way.",
    "If the\nfirm had had to pay out a hundred thousand pounds to Adele\nFortescue under her husbands will it would I think have crashed.",
    "If\nMrs Fortescue had survived her husband for a month that money\nwould have had to be paid out to her.",
    "She would have had no feeling\nfor the firm or its difficulties.",
    "But she didnt survive her husband for a\nmonth.",
    "She died and as a result of her death the gainer was the\nresiduary legatee of Rex Fortescues will.",
    "In other words Percival\nFortescue again.",
    "Always Percival Fortescue the Inspector continued bitterly.",
    "And\nthough he could have tampered with the marmalade he couldnt have\npoisoned his stepmother or strangled Gladys.",
    "According to his\n\n\fsecretary he was in his city office at five oclock that afternoon and he\ndidnt arrive back here until nearly seven.",
    "That makes it very difficult doesnt it said Miss Marple.",
    "It makes it impossible said Inspector Neele gloomily.",
    "In other\nwords Percival is out.",
    "Abandoning restraint and prudence he spoke\nwith some bitterness almost unaware of his listener.",
    "Wherever I go\nwherever I turn I always come up against the same person.",
    "Percival\nFortescue Yet it cant be Percival Fortescue.",
    "Calming himself a little\nhe said Oh there are other possibilities other people who had a\nperfectly good motive.",
    "Mr Dubois of course said Miss Marple sharply.",
    "And that young Mr\nWright.",
    "I do so agree with you Inspector.",
    "Wherever there is a question\nof gain one has to be very suspicious.",
    "The great thing to avoid is\nhaving in any way a trustful mind.",
    "In spite of himself Neele smiled.",
    "Always think the worst eh he asked.",
    "It seemed a curious doctrine to be proceeding from this charming and\nfragile looking old lady.",
    "Oh yes said Miss Marple fervently.",
    "I always believe the worst.",
    "What\nis so sad is that one is usually justified in doing so.",
    "All right said Neele lets think the worst.",
    "Dubois could have done it\nGerald Wright could have done it that is to say if hed been acting in\n\n\fcollusion\n\nwith\n\nElaine\n\nFortescue\n\nand\n\nshe\n\ntampered\n\nwith\n\nthe\n\nmarmalade Mrs Percival could have done it I suppose.",
    "She was on\nthe spot.",
    "But none of the people I have mentioned tie up with the crazy\nangle.",
    "They dont tie up with blackbirds and pockets full of rye.",
    "Thats\nyour theory and it may be that youre right.",
    "If so it boils down to one\nperson doesnt it Mrs MacKenzies in a mental home and has been for\na good number of years.",
    "She hasnt been messing about with\nmarmalade pots or putting cyanide in the drawingroom afternoon tea.",
    "Her son Donald was killed at Dunkirk.",
    "That leaves the daughter.",
    "Ruby\nMacKenzie.",
    "And if your theory is correct if this whole series of\nmurders arises out of the old Blackbird Mine business then Ruby\nMacKenzie must be here in this house and theres only one person\nthat Ruby MacKenzie could be.",
    "I think you know said Miss Marple that youre being a little too\ndogmatic.",
    "Inspector Neele paid no attention.",
    "Just one person he said grimly.",
    "He got up and went out of the room.",
    "II\n\nMary Dove was in her own sittingroom.",
    "It was a small rather austerely\nfurnished room but comfortable.",
    "That is to say Miss Dove herself had\nmade it comfortable.",
    "When Inspector Neele tapped at the door Mary\nDove raised her head which had been bent over a pile of tradesmens\nbooks and said in her clear voice\n\n\fCome in.",
    "The Inspector entered.",
    "Do sit down.",
    "Inspector.",
    "Miss Dove indicated a chair.",
    "Could you wait\njust one moment The total of the fishmongers account does not seem\nto be correct and I must check it.",
    "Inspector Neele sat in silence watching her as she totted up the\ncolumn.",
    "How wonderfully calm and selfpossessed the girl was he\nthought.",
    "He was intrigued as so often before by the personality that\nunderlay that selfassured manner.",
    "He tried to trace in her features\nany resemblance to those of the woman he had talked to at the\nPinewood Sanatorium.",
    "The colouring was not unlike but he could\ndetect no real facial resemblance.",
    "Presently Mary Dove raised her\nhead from her accounts and said\n\nYes Inspector What can I do for you\n\nInspector Neele said quietly\n\nYou know.",
    "Miss Dove there are certain very peculiar features about\nthis case.",
    "Yes\n\nTo begin with there is the odd circumstance of the rye found in Mr\nFortescues pocket.",
    "That was very extraordinary Mary Dove agreed.",
    "You know I really\ncannot think of any explanation for that.",
    "Then there is the curious circumstance of the blackbirds.",
    "Those four\nblackbirds on Mr Fortescues desk last summer and also the incident\nof the blackbirds being substituted for the veal and ham in the pie.",
    "You\nwere here I think Miss Dove at the time of both those occurrences\n\nYes I was.",
    "I remember now.",
    "It was most upsetting.",
    "It seemed such a\nvery purposeless spiteful thing to do especially at the time.",
    "Perhaps not entirely purposeless.",
    "What do you know.",
    "Miss Dove\nabout the Blackbird Mine\n\nI dont think Ive ever heard of the Blackbird Mine\n\nYour name you told me is Mary Dove.",
    "Is that your real name Miss\nDove\n\nMary Dove raised her eyebrows.",
    "Inspector Neele was almost sure that\na wary expression had come to her blue eyes.",
    "What an extraordinary question Inspector.",
    "Are you suggesting that\nmy name is not Mary Dove\n\nThat is exactly what I am suggesting.",
    "Im suggesting said Neele\npleasantly that your name is Ruby MacKenzie.",
    "She stared at him.",
    "For a moment her face was entirely blank with\nneither protest on it nor surprise.",
    "There was Inspector Neele thought\n\n\fa very definite effect of calculation.",
    "After a minute or two she said in a\nquiet colourless voice\n\nWhat do you expect me to say\n\nPlease answer me.",
    "Is your name Ruby MacKenzie\n\nI have told you my name is Mary Dove.",
    "Yes but have you proof of that Miss Dove\n\nWhat do you want to see My birth certificate\n\nThat might be helpful or it might not.",
    "You might I mean be in\npossession of the birth certificate of a Mary Dove.",
    "That Mary Dove\nmight be a friend of yours or might be someone who had died.",
    "Yes there are a lot of possibilities arent there Amusement had\ncrept back into Mary Doves voice.",
    "Its really quite a dilemma for you\nisnt it.",
    "Inspector\n\nThey might possibly be able to recognise you at Pinewood\nSanatorium said Neele.",
    "Pinewood Sanatorium Mary raised her eyebrows.",
    "What or where is\nPinewood Sanatorium\n\nI think you know very well Miss Dove.",
    "I assure you I am quite in the dark.",
    "And you deny categorically that you are Ruby MacKenzie\n\nI shouldnt really like to deny anything.",
    "I think you know Inspector\nthat its up to you to prove I am this Ruby MacKenzie whoever she is.",
    "There was definite amusement now in her blue eyes amusement and\nchallenge.",
    "Looking him straight in the eyes Mary Dove said Yes its\nup to you Inspector.",
    "Prove that Im Ruby MacKenzie if you can.",
    "Chapter 25\n\nThe old tabbys looking for you sir said Sergeant Hay in a\nconspiratorial whisper as Inspector Neele descended the stairs.",
    "It\nappears as how shes got a lot more to say to you.",
    "Hell and damnation said Inspector Neele.",
    "Yes sir said Sergeant Hay not a muscle of his face moving.",
    "He was about to move away when Neele called him back.",
    "Go over those notes given us by Miss Dove Hay notes as to her\nformer employment and situations.",
    "Check up on them  and yes there\nare just one or two other things that I would like to know.",
    "Put these\ninquiries in hand will you\n\nHe jotted down a few lines on a sheet of paper and gave them to\nSergeant Hay who said\n\nIll get on to it at once sir.",
    "Hearing a murmur of voices in the library as he passed.",
    "Inspector\nNeele looked in.",
    "Whether Miss Marple had been looking for him or not she was now\nfully engaged talking to Mrs Percival Fortescue while her knitting\nneedles clicked busily.",
    "The middle of the sentence which Inspector\nNeele caught was\n\n...",
    "I have really always thought it was a vocation you needed for\nnursing.",
    "It certainly is very noble work.",
    "Inspector Neele withdrew quietly.",
    "Miss Marple had noticed him he\nthought but she had taken no notice of his presence.",
    "She went on in her gentle soft voice\n\nI had such a charming nurse looking after me when I once broke my\nwrist.",
    "She went on from me to nurse Mrs Sparrows son a very nice\nyoung naval officer.",
    "Quite a romance really because they became\nengaged.",
    "So romantic I thought it.",
    "They were married and were very\nhappy and had two dear little children.",
    "Miss Marple sighed\nsentimentally.",
    "It was pneumonia you know.",
    "So much depends on\nnursing in pneumonia does it not.",
    "Oh yes said Jennifer Fortescue nursing is nearly everything in\npneumonia though of course nowadays M and B works wonders and\nits not the long protracted battle it used to be.",
    "Im sure you must have been an excellent nurse my dear said Miss\nMarple.",
    "That was the beginning of your romance was it not I mean\nyou came here to nurse Mr Percival Fortescue did you not\n\nYes said Jennifer.",
    "Yes yes  thats how it did happen.",
    "Her voice was not encouraging but Miss Marple seemed to take no\nnotice.",
    "I understand.",
    "One should not listen to servants gossip of course but\nIm afraid an old lady like myself is always interested to hear about the\npeople in the house.",
    "Now what was I saying Oh yes.",
    "There was\nanother nurse at first was there not and she got sent away something like that.",
    "Carelessness I believe.",
    "I dont think it was carelessness said Jennifer.",
    "I believe her father\nor something was desperately ill and so I came to replace her.",
    "I see said Miss Marple.",
    "And you fell in love and that was that.",
    "Yes\nvery nice indeed very nice.",
    "Im not so sure about that said Jennifer Fortescue.",
    "I often wish \nher voice trembled  I often wish I was back in the wards again.",
    "Yes yes I understand.",
    "You were keen on your profession.",
    "I wasnt so much at the time but now when I think of it  lifes so\nmonotonous you know.",
    "Day after day with nothing to do and Val so\nabsorbed in business.",
    "Miss Marple shook her head.",
    "Gentlemen have to work so hard nowadays she said.",
    "There really\ndoesnt seem any leisure no matter how much money there is.",
    "Yes it makes it very lonely and dull for a wife sometimes.",
    "I often wish\nId never come here said Jennifer.",
    "Oh well I dare say it serves me\nright.",
    "I ought never to have done it.",
    "Ought never to have done what my dear\n\nI ought never to have married Val.",
    "Oh well  she sighed abruptly.",
    "Dont lets talk of it any more.",
    "Obligingly Miss Marple began to talk about the new skirts that were\nbeing worn in Paris.",
    "II\n\nSo kind of you not to interrupt just now said Miss Marple when\nhaving tapped at the door of the study.",
    "Inspector Neele had told her to\ncome in.",
    "There was just one or two little points you know that I\nwanted to verify.",
    "She added reproachfully.",
    "We didnt really finish our\ntalk just now.",
    "Im so sorry Miss Marple.",
    "Inspector Neele summoned up a charming\nsmile.",
    "Im afraid I was rather rude.",
    "I summoned you to a consultation\nand did all the talking myself.",
    "Oh thats quite all right said Miss Marple immediately because\nyou see I wasnt really quite ready then to put all my cards on the\ntable.",
    "I mean I wouldnt like to make any accusation unless I was\nabsolutely sure about it.",
    "Sure that is in my own mind.",
    "And I am sure\nnow.",
    "Youre sure about what Miss Marple\n\nWell certainly about who killed Mr Fortescue.",
    "What you told me about\nthe marmalade I mean just clinches the matter.",
    "Showing how I mean\nas well as who and well within the mental capacity.",
    "Inspector Neele blinked a little.",
    "Im so sorry said Miss Marple perceiving this reaction on his part\nIm afraid I find it difficult sometimes to make myself perfectly clear.",
    "Im not quite sure yet.",
    "Miss Marple what were talking about.",
    "Well perhaps said Miss Marple wed better begin all over again.",
    "I\nmean if you could spare the time.",
    "I would rather like to put my own\npoint of view before you.",
    "You see Ive talked a good deal to people to\nold Miss Ramsbottom and to Mrs Crump and to her husband.",
    "He of\ncourse is a liar but that doesnt really matter because if you know\nliars are liars it comes to the same thing.",
    "But I did want to get the\ntelephone calls clear and the nylon stockings and all that.",
    "Inspector Neele blinked again and wondered what he had let himself in\nfor and why he had ever thought that Miss Marple might be a desirable\nand clearheaded colleague.",
    "Still he thought to himself however\n\n\fmuddleheaded she was she might have picked up some useful bits of\ninformation.",
    "All Inspector Neeles successes in his profession had\ncome from listening well.",
    "He was prepared to listen now.",
    "Please tell me all about it.",
    "Miss Marple he said but start at the\nbeginning wont you.",
    "Yes of course said Miss Marple and the beginning is Gladys.",
    "I\nmean I came here because of Gladys.",
    "And you very kindly let me look\nthrough all her things.",
    "And what with that and the nylon stockings and\nthe telephone calls and one thing and another it did come out\nperfectly clear.",
    "I mean about Mr Fortescue and the taxine.",
    "You have a theory asked Inspector Neele as to who put the taxine\ninto Mr Fortescues marmalade.",
    "It isnt a theory said Miss Marple.",
    "I know.",
    "For the third time Inspector Neele blinked.",
    "It was Gladys of course said Miss Marple.",
    "Chapter 26\n\nInspector Neele stared at Miss Marple and slowly shook his head.",
    "Are you saying he said incredulously that Gladys Martin\ndeliberately murdered Rex Fortescue Im sorry Miss Marple but I\nsimply dont believe it.",
    "No of course she didnt mean to murder him said Miss Marple but\nshe did it all the same You said yourself that she was nervous and\nupset when you questioned her.",
    "And that she looked guilty.",
    "Yes but not guilty of murder.",
    "Oh no I agree.",
    "As I say she didnt mean to murder anybody but she\nput the taxine in the marmalade.",
    "She didnt think it was poison of\ncourse.",
    "What did she think it was Inspector Neeles voice still sounded\nincredulous.",
    "I rather imagine she thought it was a truth drug said Miss Marple.",
    "Its very interesting you know and very instructive  the things these\ngirls cut out of papers and keep.",
    "Its always been the same you know\nall through the ages.",
    "Recipes for beauty for attracting the man you\nlove.",
    "And witchcraft and charms and marvellous happenings.",
    "Nowadays theyre mostly lumped together under the heading of\nScience.",
    "Nobody believes in magicians any more nobody believes that\nanyone can come along and wave a wand and turn you into a frog.",
    "But\nif you read in the paper that by injecting certain glands scientists can\nalter your vital tissues and youll develop froglike characteristics well\neverybody would believe that.",
    "And having read in the papers about\ntruth drugs of course Gladys would believe it absolutely when he told\nher that thats what it was.",
    "When who told her asked Inspector Neele.",
    "Albert Evans said Miss Marple.",
    "Not of course that that is really his\nname.",
    "But anyway he met her last summer at a holiday camp and he\nflattered her up and made love to her and I should imagine told her\nsome story of injustice or persecution or something like that.",
    "Anyway\nthe point was that Rex Fortescue had to be made to confess what he\nhad done and make restitution.",
    "I dont know this of course.",
    "Inspector\nNeele but Im pretty sure about it.",
    "He got her to take a post here and\nits really very easy nowadays with the shortage of domestic staff to\nobtain a post where you want one.",
    "Staffs are changing the whole time.",
    "Then they arranged a date together.",
    "You remember on that last\npostcard he said Remember our date.",
    "That was to be the great day\nthey were working for.",
    "Gladys would put the drug that he gave her into\nthe top of the marmalade so that Mr Fortescue would eat it at\nbreakfast and she would also put the rye in his pocket.",
    "I dont know\nwhat story he told her to account for the rye but as I told you from the\nbeginning Inspector Neele Gladys Martin was a very credulous girl.",
    "In\nfact theres hardly anything she wouldnt believe if a personable\nyoung man put it to her the right way.",
    "Go on said Inspector Neele in a dazed voice.",
    "The idea probably was continued Miss Marple that Albert was\ngoing to call upon him at the office that day and that by that time the\ntruth drug would have worked and that Mr Fortescue would have\nconfessed everything and so on and so on.",
    "You can imagine the poor\ngirls feelings when she hears that Mr Fortescue is dead.",
    "But surely Inspector Neele objected she would have told\n\nMiss Marple asked sharply\n\n\fWhat was the first thing she said to you when you questioned her\n\nShe said I didnt do it Inspector Neele said.",
    "Exactly said Miss Marple triumphantly.",
    "Dont you see thats exactly\nwhat she would say If she broke an ornament you know Gladys\nwould always say I didnt do it Miss Marple.",
    "I cant think how it\nhappened.",
    "They cant help it poor dears.",
    "Theyre very upset at what\ntheyve done and their great idea is to avoid blame.",
    "You dont think that\na nervous young woman who had murdered someone when she didnt\nmean to murder him is going to admit it do you That would have\nbeen quite out of character.",
    "Yes Neele said I suppose it would.",
    "He ran his mind back over his interview with Gladys.",
    "Nervous upset\nguilty shiftyeyed all those things.",
    "They might have had small\nsignificance or a big one.",
    "He could not really blame himself for having\nfailed to come to the right conclusion.",
    "Her first idea as I say went on Miss Marple would be to deny it all.",
    "Then in a confused way she would try to sort it all out in her mind.",
    "Perhaps Albert hadnt known how strong the stuff was or hed made a\nmistake and given her too much of it.",
    "Shed think of excuses for him\nand explanations.",
    "Shed hope hed get in touch with her which of\ncourse he did.",
    "By telephone.",
    "Do you know that asked Neele sharply.",
    "Miss Marple shook her\nhead.",
    "No.",
    "I admit Im assuming it.",
    "But there were unexplained calls that day.",
    "That is to say people rang up and when Crump or Mrs Crump\nanswered the phone was hung up.",
    "Thats what hed do you know.",
    "Ring up and wait until Gladys answered the phone and then hed make\nan appointment with her to meet him.",
    "I see said Neele.",
    "You mean she had an appointment to meet him on\nthe day she died.",
    "Miss Marple nodded vigorously.",
    "Yes that was indicated.",
    "Mrs Crump was right about one thing.",
    "The\ngirl had on her best nylon stockings and her good shoes.",
    "She was\ngoing to meet someone.",
    "Only she wasnt going out to meet him.",
    "He was\ncoming to Yewtree Lodge.",
    "Thats why she was on the look out that day\nand flustered and late with tea.",
    "Then as she brought the second tray\ninto the hall I think she looked along the passage to the side door and\nsaw him there beckoning to her.",
    "She put the tray down and went out\nto meet him.",
    "And then he strangled her said Neele.",
    "Miss Marple pursed her lips together.",
    "It would only take a minute\nshe said but he couldnt risk her talking.",
    "She had to die poor silly\ncredulous girl.",
    "And then  he put a clothes peg on her nose Stern\nanger vibrated the old ladys voice.",
    "To make it fit in with the rhyme.",
    "The rye the blackbirds the countinghouse the bread and honey and\nthe clothes peg  the nearest he could get to a little dicky bird that\nnipped off her nose \n\n\fAnd I suppose at the end of it all hell go to Broadmoor and we shant\nbe able to hang him because hes crazy said Neele slowly.",
    "I think youll hang him all right said Miss Marple.",
    "And hes not crazy.",
    "Inspector not for a moment\n\nInspector Neele looked hard at her.",
    "Now see here.",
    "Miss Marple youve outlined a theory to me.",
    "Yes  yes although you say you know its only a theory.",
    "Youre saying that a man\nis responsible for these crimes who called himself Albert Evans who\npicked up the girl Gladys at a holiday camp and used her for his own\npurposes.",
    "This Albert Evans was someone who wanted revenge for the\nold Blackbird Mine business.",
    "Youre suggesting arent you that Mrs\nMacKenzies son Don MacKenzie didnt die at Dunkirk.",
    "That hes still\nalive that hes behind all this\n\nBut to Inspector Neeles surprise.",
    "Miss Marple was shaking her head\nviolently.",
    "Oh no she said oh no Im not suggesting that at all.",
    "Dont you see\nInspector Neele all this blackbird business is really a complete fake.",
    "It\nwas used that was all used by somebody who heard about the\nblackbirds  the ones in the library and in the pie.",
    "The blackbirds were\ngenuine enough.",
    "They were put there by someone who knew about the\nold business who wanted revenge for it.",
    "But only the revenge of trying\nto frighten Mr Fortescue or to make him uncomfortable.",
    "I dont believe\nyou know Inspector Neele that children can really be brought up and\ntaught to wait and brood and carry out revenge.",
    "Children after all\n\n\fhave got a lot of sense.",
    "But anyone whose father had been swindled\nand perhaps left to die might be willing to play a malicious trick on the\nperson who was supposed to have done it.",
    "Thats what happened I\nthink.",
    "And the killer used it.",
    "The killer said Inspector Neele.",
    "Come now Miss Marple lets have\nyour ideas about the killer.",
    "Who was he\n\nYou wont be surprised said Miss Marple.",
    "Not really.",
    "Because youll\nsee as soon as I tell you who he is or rather who I think he is for one\nmust be accurate must one not  youll see that hes just the type of\nperson who would commit these murders.",
    "Hes sane brilliant and\nquite unscrupulous.",
    "And he did it of course for money probably for a\ngood deal of money.",
    "Percival Fortescue Inspector Neele spoke almost imploringly but\nhe knew as he spoke that he was wrong.",
    "The picture of the man that\nMiss Marple had built up for him had no resemblance to Percival\nFortescue.",
    "Oh no said Miss Marple.",
    "Not Percival.",
    "Lance.",
    "Chapter 27\n\nIts impossible said Inspector Neele.",
    "He leaned back in his chair and watched Miss Marple with fascinated\neyes.",
    "As Miss Marple had said he was not surprised.",
    "His words were a\ndenial not of probability but of possibility.",
    "Lance Fortescue fitted the\n\n\fdescription Miss Marple had outlined it well enough.",
    "But Inspector\nNeele simply could not see how Lance could be the answer.",
    "Miss Marple leaned forward in her chair and gently persuasively and\nrather in the manner of someone explaining the simple facts of\narithmetic to a small child outlined her theory.",
    "Hes always been like that you see.",
    "I mean hes always been bad.",
    "Bad all through although with it hes always been attractive.",
    "Especially attractive to women.",
    "Hes got a brilliant mind and hell take\nrisks.",
    "Hes always taken risks and because of his charm people have\nalways believed the best and not the worst about him.",
    "He came home\nin the summer to see his father.",
    "I dont believe for a moment that his\nfather wrote to him or sent for him  unless of course youve got\nactual evidence to that effect.",
    "She paused inquiringly.",
    "Neele shook his head.",
    "No he said Ive no evidence of his father\nsending for him.",
    "Ive got a letter that Lance is supposed to have written\nto him after being here.",
    "But Lance could quite easily have slipped that\namong his fathers papers in the study here the day he arrived.",
    "Sharp of him said Miss Marple nodding her head.",
    "Well as I say he\nprobably flew over here and attempted a reconciliation with his father\nbut Mr Fortescue wouldnt have it.",
    "You see Lance had recently got\nmarried and the small pittance he was living on and which he had\ndoubtless been supplementing in various dishonest ways was not\nenough for him any more.",
    "He was very much in love with Pat who is a\ndear sweet girl and he wanted a respectable settled life with her nothing shifty.",
    "And that from his point of view meant having a lot of\nmoney.",
    "When he was at Yewtree Lodge he must have heard about\n\n\fthese blackbirds.",
    "Perhaps his father mentioned them.",
    "Perhaps Adele\ndid.",
    "He jumped to the conclusion that MacKenzies daughter was\nestablished in the house and it occurred to him that she would make a\nvery good scapegoat for murder.",
    "Because you see when he realised\nthat he couldnt get his father to do what he wanted he must have\ncoldbloodedly decided that murder it would have to be.",
    "He may have\nrealised that his father wasnt  er very well  and have feared that by\nthe time his father died there would have been a complete crash.",
    "He knew about his fathers health all right said the Inspector.",
    "Ah  that explains a good deal.",
    "Perhaps the coincidence of his fathers\nChristian name being Rex together with the blackbird incident\nsuggested the idea of the nursery rhyme.",
    "Make a crazy business of the\nwhole thing  and tie it up with that old revenge threat of the\nMacKenzies.",
    "Then you see he could dispose of Adele too and that\nhundred thousand pounds going out of the firm.",
    "But there would have\nto be a third character the maid in the garden hanging out the\nclothes  and I suppose that suggested the whole wicked plan to him.",
    "An innocent accomplice whom he could silence before she could talk.",
    "And that would give him what he wanted  a genuine alibi for the first\nmurder.",
    "The rest was easy.",
    "He arrived here from the station just\nbefore five oclock which was the time when Gladys brought the\nsecond tray into the hall.",
    "He came to the side door saw her and\nbeckoned to her.",
    "Strangling her and carrying her body round the\nhouse to where the clothes lines were would only have taken three or\nfour minutes.",
    "Then he rang the frontdoor bell was admitted to the\nhouse and joined the family for tea.",
    "After tea he went up to see Miss\nRamsbottom.",
    "When he came down he slipped into the drawingroom\nfound Adele alone there drinking a last cup of tea and sat down by her\n\n\fon the sofa and while he was talking to her he managed to slip the\ncyanide into her tea.",
    "It wouldnt be difficult you know.",
    "A little piece of\nwhite stuff like sugar.",
    "He might have stretched out his hand to the\nsugar basin and taken a lump and apparently dropped it into her cup.",
    "Hed laugh and say Look Ive dropped more sugar into your tea.",
    "Shed say she didnt mind stir it and drink it.",
    "It would be as easy and\naudacious as that.",
    "Yes hes an audacious fellow.",
    "Inspector Neele said slowly\n\nIts actually possible  yes.",
    "But I cannot see  really Miss Marple I\ncannot see  what he stood to gain by it.",
    "Granted that unless old\nFortescue died the business would soon be on the rocks is Lances\nshare big enough to cause him to plan three murders I dont think so.",
    "I really dont think so.",
    "That is a little difficult admitted Miss Marple.",
    "Yes I agree with you.",
    "That does present difficulties.",
    "I suppose... She hesitated looking at\nthe Inspector.",
    "I suppose  I am so very ignorant in financial matters but I suppose it is really true that the Blackbird Mine is worthless\n\nNeele reflected.",
    "Various scraps fitted together in his mind.",
    "Lances\nwillingness to take the various speculative or worthless shares off\nPercivals hands.",
    "His parting words today in London that Percival had\nbetter get rid of the Blackbird and its hoodoo.",
    "A gold mine.",
    "A worthless\ngold mine.",
    "But perhaps the mine had not been worthless.",
    "And yet\nsomehow that seemed unlikely.",
    "Old Rex Fortescue was hardly likely to\nhave made a mistake on that point although of course there might\nhave been soundings recently.",
    "Where was the mine West Africa\nLance had said.",
    "Yes but somebody else  was it Miss Ramsbottom  had\n\n\fsaid it was in East Africa.",
    "Had Lance been deliberately misleading\nwhen he said West instead of East Miss Ramsbottom was old and\nforgetful and yet she might have been right and not Lance.",
    "East\nAfrica.",
    "Lance had just come from East Africa.",
    "Had he perhaps some\nrecent knowledge\n\nSuddenly with a click another piece fitted into the Inspectors puzzle.",
    "Sitting in the train reading The Times.",
    "Uranium deposits found in\nTanganyika.",
    "Supposing that the uranium deposits were on the site of\nthe old Blackbird That would explain everything.",
    "Lance had come to\nhave knowledge of that being on the spot and with uranium deposits\nthere there was a fortune to be grasped.",
    "An enormous fortune He\nsighed.",
    "He looked at Miss Marple.",
    "How do you think he asked reproachfully that Im ever going to be\nable to prove all this\n\nMiss Marple nodded at him encouragingly as an aunt might have\nencouraged a bright nephew who was going in for a scholarship exam.",
    "Youll prove it she said.",
    "Youre a very very clever man Inspector\nNeele.",
    "Ive seen that from the first.",
    "Now you know who it is you ought\nto be able to get the evidence.",
    "At that holiday camp for instance\ntheyll recognise his photograph.",
    "Hell find it hard to explain why he\nstayed there for a week calling himself Albert Evans.",
    "Yes Inspector Neele thought.",
    "Lance Fortescue was brilliant and\nunscrupulous  but he was foolhardy too.",
    "The risks he took were just a\nlittle too great.",
    "Neele thought to himself Ill get him Then doubt sweeping over him\nhe looked at Miss Marple.",
    "Its all pure assumption you know he said.",
    "Yes  but you are sure arent you\n\nI suppose so.",
    "After all Ive known his kind before.",
    "The old lady nodded.",
    "Yes  that matters so much  thats really why Im sure.",
    "Neele looked at her playfully.",
    "Because of your knowledge of criminals.",
    "Oh no  of course not.",
    "Because of Pat  a dear girl  and the kind that\nalways marries a bad lot  thats really what drew my attention to him at\nthe start \n\nI may be sure  in my own mind said the Inspector  but theres a lot\nthat needs explaining  the Ruby MacKenzie business for instance.",
    "I\ncould swear that \n\nMiss Marple interrupted\n\nAnd youre quite right.",
    "But youve been thinking of the wrong person.",
    "Go and talk to Mrs Percy.",
    "II\n\nMrs Fortescue said Inspector Neele do you mind telling me your\nname before you were married.",
    "Oh Jennifer gasped.",
    "She looked frightened.",
    "You neednt be nervous madam said Inspector Neele but its much\nbetter to come out with the truth.",
    "Im right I think in saying that your\nname before you were married was Ruby MacKenzie\n\nMy  well oh well  oh dear  well why shouldnt it be said Mrs\nPercival Fortescue.",
    "No reason at all said Inspector Neele gently and added I was\ntalking to your mother a few days ago at Pinewood Sanatorium.",
    "Shes very angry with me said Jennifer.",
    "I never go and see her now\nbecause it only upsets her.",
    "Poor Mumsy she was so devoted to Dad\nyou know.",
    "And she brought you up to have very melodramatic ideas of\nrevenge\n\nYes said Jennifer.",
    "She kept making us swear on the Bible that wed\nnever forget and that wed kill him one day.",
    "Of course once Id gone\ninto hospital and started my training I began to realise that her mental\nbalance wasnt what it should be.",
    "You yourself must have felt revengeful though Mrs Fortescue\n\n\fWell of course I did.",
    "Rex Fortescue practically murdered my father I\ndont mean he actually shot him or knifed him or anything like that.",
    "But\nIm quite certain that he did leave Father to die.",
    "Thats the same thing\nisnt it\n\nIts the same thing morally  yes.",
    "So I did want to pay him back said Jennifer.",
    "When a friend of mine\ncame to nurse his son I got her to leave and to propose my replacing\nher.",
    "I dont know exactly what I meant to do...",
    "I didnt really I didnt\nInspector I never meant to kill Mr Fortescue.",
    "I had some idea I think\nof nursing his son so badly that the son would die.",
    "But of course if you\nare a nurse by profession you cant do that sort of thing.",
    "Actually I had\nquite a job pulling Val through.",
    "And then he got fond of me and asked\nme to marry him and I thought Well really thats a far more sensible\nrevenge than anything else.",
    "I mean to marry Mr Fortescues eldest\nson and get the money he swindled Father out of back that way.",
    "I think\nit was a far more sensible way.",
    "Yes indeed said Inspector Neele far more sensible.",
    "He added It\nwas you I suppose who put the blackbirds on the desk and in the\npie\n\nMrs Percival flushed.",
    "Yes.",
    "I suppose it was silly of me really...",
    "But Mr Fortescue had been\ntalking about suckers one day and boasting of how hed swindled\npeople  got the best of them.",
    "Oh in quite a legal way.",
    "And I thought Id\njust like to give him  well a kind of fright.",
    "And it did give him a fright\n\n\fHe was awfully upset.",
    "She added anxiously But I didnt do anything\nelse I didnt really.",
    "Inspector.",
    "You dont  you dont honestly think I\nwould murder anyone do you\n\nInspector Neele smiled.",
    "No he said I dont.",
    "He added By the way have you given Miss\nDove any money lately\n\nJennifers jaw dropped.",
    "How did you know\n\nWe know a lot of things said Inspector Neele and added to himself\nAnd guess a good many too.",
    "Jennifer continued speaking rapidly.",
    "She came to me and said that youd accused her of being Ruby\nMacKenzie.",
    "She said if Id get hold of five hundred pounds shed let you\ngo on thinking so.",
    "She said if you knew that I was Ruby MacKenzie Id\nbe suspected of murdering Mr Fortescue and my stepmother.",
    "I had an\nawful job getting the money because of course I couldnt tell Percival.",
    "He doesnt know about me.",
    "I had to sell my diamond engagement ring\nand a very beautiful necklace Mr Fortescue gave me.",
    "Dont worry Mrs Percival said Inspector Neele I think we can get\nyour money back for you.",
    "III\n\n\fIt was on the following day that Inspector Neele had another interview\nwith Miss Mary Dove.",
    "I wonder Miss Dove he said if youd give me a cheque for five\nhundred pounds payable to Mrs Percival Fortescue.",
    "He had the pleasure of seeing Mary Dove lose countenance for once.",
    "The silly fool told you I suppose she said.",
    "Yes.",
    "Blackmail Miss Dove is rather a serious charge.",
    "It wasnt exactly blackmail.",
    "Inspector.",
    "I think youd find it hard to\nmake out a case of blackmail against me.",
    "I was just doing Mrs Percival\na special service to oblige her.",
    "Well if youll give me that cheque Miss Dove well leave it like that.",
    "Mary Dove got her cheque book and took out her fountain pen.",
    "Its very annoying she said with a sigh.",
    "Im particularly hard up at\nthe moment.",
    "Youll be looking for another job soon I suppose\n\nYes.",
    "This one hasnt turned out quite according to plan.",
    "Its all been\nvery unfortunate from my point of view.",
    "Inspector Neele agreed.",
    "Yes it put you in rather a difficult position didnt it I mean it was\nquite likely that at any moment we might have to look into your\nantecedents.",
    "Mary Dove cool once more allowed her eyebrows to rise.",
    "Really Inspector my past is quite blameless I assure you.",
    "Yes it is Inspector Neele agreed cheerfully.",
    "Weve nothing against\nyou at all Miss Dove.",
    "Its a curious coincidence though that in the last\nthree places which you have filled so admirably there have happened\nto be robberies about three months after you left.",
    "The thieves have\nseemed remarkably well informed as to where mink coats jewels etc.",
    "were kept.",
    "Curious coincidence isnt it\n\nCoincidences do happen Inspector.",
    "Oh yes said Neele.",
    "They happen.",
    "But they mustnt happen too\noften Miss Dove.",
    "I dare say he added that we may meet again in the\nfuture.",
    "I hope  said Mary Dove I dont mean to be rude.",
    "Inspector Neele but I hope we dont.",
    "Chapter 28\n\nMiss Marple smoothed over the top of her suitcase tucked in an end of\nwoolly shawl and shut the lid down.",
    "She looked round her bedroom.",
    "No she had left nothing behind.",
    "Crump came in to fetch down her\n\n\fluggage.",
    "Miss Marple went into the next room to say goodbye to Miss\nRamsbottom.",
    "Im afraid said Miss Marple that Ive made a very poor return for\nyour hospitality.",
    "I hope you will be able to forgive me some day.",
    "Hah said Miss Ramsbottom.",
    "She was as usual playing patience.",
    "Black knave red queen she observed then she darted a shrewd\nsideways glance at Miss Marple.",
    "You found out what you wanted to I\nsuppose she said.",
    "Yes.",
    "And I suppose youve told that police inspector all about it Will he be\nable to prove a case\n\nIm almost sure he will said Miss Marple.",
    "It may take a little time.",
    "Im not asking you any questions said Miss Ramsbottom.",
    "Youre a\nshrewd woman.",
    "I knew that as soon as I saw you.",
    "I dont blame you for\nwhat youve done.",
    "Wickedness is wickedness and has got to be\npunished.",
    "Theres a bad streak in this family.",
    "It didnt come from our\nside Im thankful to say.",
    "Elvira my sister was a fool.",
    "Nothing worse.",
    "Black knave repeated Miss Ramsbottom fingering the card.",
    "Handsome but a black heart.",
    "Yes I was afraid of it.",
    "Ah well you\ncant always help loving a sinner.",
    "The boy always had a way with him.",
    "Even got round me... Told a lie about the time he left me that day.",
    "I\ndidnt contradict him but I wondered... Ive wondered ever since.",
    "But\nhe was Elviras boy  I couldnt bring myself to say anything.",
    "Ah well\nyoure a righteous woman Jane Marple and right must prevail.",
    "Im\nsorry for his wife though.",
    "So am I said Miss Marple.",
    "In the hall Pat Fortescue was waiting to say goodbye.",
    "I wish you werent going she said.",
    "I shall miss you.",
    "Its time for me to go said Miss Marple.",
    "Ive finished what I came\nhere to do.",
