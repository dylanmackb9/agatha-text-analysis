    "Badly topped it scudded along the ground and\nembedded itself firmly in the bunker\n\nThere were no eager crowds to groan with dismay.",
    "The solitary\nwitness of the shot manifested no surprise.",
    "And that is easily\nexplained  for it was not the Americanbom master of the game\nwho had played the shot but merely the fourth son of the Vicar\nofMarchboh  a small seaside town on the coast of Wales.",
    "Bobby uttered a decidedly profane ejaculation.",
    "He was an amiablelooking young man of about eight and twenty.",

    "Bobby sighed teed his ball reteed it waggled his club a long time\ntook back stiffly shut his eyes raised his head depressed his right\nshoulder did everything he ought not to have done and hit a\nscreamer down the middle of the course.",
    "He drew a deep breath of satisfaction.",
    "The wellknown golfers\ngloom passed from his eloquent face to be succeeded by the\nequally wellknown golfers exultation.",

    "He peered out to the right.",
    "It was a\ndifficult light.",

    "The doctor came over towards him since the next tee was right on\nthe edge of the cliff.",
    "The seventeenth was Bobbys particular bugbear.",
    "At it you had to\ndrive over a chasm.",
    "The distance was not actually so great but the\nattraction of the depths below was overpowering.",
    "They had crossed the footpath which now ran inland to their left\nskirting the very edge of the cliff.",
    "The doctor took an iron and just landed on the other side.",
    "Bobby took a deep breath and drove.",

    "Bobby walked slowly along.",
    "There was he knew one place where\none could scramble down fairly easily.",
    "Caddies did so hurling\nthemselves over the edge and reappearing triumphant and panting\nwith the missing ball.",
    "Suddenly Bobby stiffened and called to his companion.",
    "I say doctor come here.",
    "What do you make of that Some forty\nfeet below was a dark heap of something that looked like old\nclothes.",

    "Nothing to be done he said.",
    "His numbers up poor fellow.",
    "His backs broken.",
    "Well well.",

    "He\nstood up again.",
    "Ill go off and get help he said.",
    "Make arrangements to have the\nbody got up.",

    "Nothing.",

    "Hell last another twenty minutes at most.",
    "Just possible he may\nrecover consciousness before the end but very likely he wont.",

    "The\npallor of approaching death couldnt disguise the deep tan of the\nskin.",
    "A man who had lived an outofdoor life  abroad perhaps.",
    "Bobby studied him more closely  the crisp curling chestnut hair\njust touched with grey at the temples the big nose the strong jaw\nthe white teeth just showing through the parted lips.",

    "Then he noticed that in his action he had jerked something else out\nof the pocket.",

    "It was a womans face strangely haunting in quality.",
    "A fair woman\nwith wideapart eyes.",
    "She seemed little more than a girl certainly\nunder thirty but it was the arresting quality of her beauty rather\nthan the beauty itself that seized upon the boys imagination.",
    "It was\nthe kind of face he thought not easy to forget.",
    "Gently and reverently he replaced the photograph in the pocket\nfrom which it had come then he sat down again to wait for the\ndoctors return.",

    "Hell work\nhimself up till he gets that pain in the tummy and then he wont be\nable to eat his supper.",

    "Poor old Dad hes got less sense than a chicken He\nsat there thinking of his father with mingled affection and\nexasperation.",
    "His life at home seemed to him to be one long\nsacrifice to his fathers peculiar ideas.",
    "To Mr Jones the same time\nseemed to be one long sacrifice on his part ill understood or\nappreciated by the younger generation.",
    "So may ideas on the same\nsubject differ.",
    "What an age the doctor was Surely he might have been back by\nthis time\n\nBobby got up and stamped his feet moodily.",
    "At that moment he\nheard something above him and looked up thankful that help was\nat hand and his own services no longer needed.",
    "But it was not the doctor.",
    "It was a man in plus fours whom Bobby\ndid not know.",
    "I say said the newcomer.",

    "If you cannot do a thing properly my dear Bobby he said it is\nbetter not to do it at all.",
    "I know that you and all your young friends\nseem to have no idea of time but there is One whom we should not\nkeep waiting.",
    "You offered to play the organ of your own accord.",

    "Honestly\nBobby it isnt good enough.",

    "I could have carried on\nperfectly.",
    "They look all right said Frankie.",
    "She looked straight into their honest brown depths.",
    "So you see said Bobby Im going in with Badger.",
    "Frankie\nnodded.",
    "An attendant opened the door and said First luncheon.",
    "Shall we\nsaid Frankie.",
    "They passed along to the dining car.",
    "Bobby made a short strategic retreat during the time when the\nticket collector might be expected.",
    "We dont want him to strain his conscience too much he said.",
    "But Frankie said she didnt expect ticket collectors had any\nconsciences.",
    "It was just after five oclock when they reached Sileham which was\nthe station for Marchbolt.",
    "The cars meeting me said Frankie.",
    "Ill give you a lift.",
    "Thanks.",
    "That will save me carrying this beastly thing for two miles.",
    "He\nkicked his suitcase disparagingly.",
    "Three miles not two said Frankie.",
    "Two miles if you go by the footpath over the links.",
    "The one where \nYes  where that fellow went over.",
    "I suppose nobody pushed him\nover did they asked Frankie as she handed her dressingcase to\nher maid.",
    "Pushed him over Good Lord no.",
    "Why Well it would make it\nmuch more exciting wouldnt it said Frankie idly.",
    "CHAPTER 4 The Inquest\n\nThe inquest on the body of Alex Pritchard was held on the following\nday.",
    "Dr Thomas gave evidence as to the finding of the body.",
    "Life was not then extinct asked the coroner.",
    "No deceased was still breathing.",
    "There was however no hope of\nrecovery.",
    "The  Here the doctor became highly technical.",
    "The\ncoroner came to the rescue of the jury In ordinary everyday\nlanguage the mans back was broken If you like to put it that\nway said Dr Thomas sadly.",
    "He described how he had gone off to get help leaving the dying\nman in Bobbys charge.",
    "Now as to the cause of this disaster what is your opinion Dr\nThomas I should say that in all probability failing any evidence as\nto his state of mind that is to say the deceased stepped\n\n\finadvertently over the edge of the cliff.",
    "There was a mist rising from\nthe sea and at that particular point the path turns abruptly inland.",
    "Owing to the mist the deceased may not have noticed the danger\nand walked straight onin which case two steps would take him\nover the edge.",
    "There were no signs of violence Such as might\nhave been administered by a third party I can only say that all the\ninjuries present are fully explained by the body striking the rocks\nfifty or sixty feet below.",
    "There remains the question of suicide\nThat is of course perfectly possible.",
    "Whether the deceased\nwalked over the edge or threw himself over is a matter on which I\ncan say nothing.",
    "Robert Jones was called next.",
    "Bobby explained that he had been playing golf with the doctor and\nhad sliced his ball towards the sea.",
    "A mist was rising at the time\nand it was difficult to see.",
    "He thought he heard a cry and for a\nmoment wondered if his ball could have hit anybody coining along\nthe footpath.",
    "He had deddedhowever that it could not possibly\nhave travelled so far.",
    "Did you find the ball Yes it was about a hundred yards short of\nthe footpath.",
    "He then described how they had driven from the next\ntee and how he himself had driven into the chasm.",
    "Here the coroner stopped him since his evidence would have been\na repetition of the doctors.",
    "He questioned him closely however as\nto the cry he had heard or thought he heard.",
    "It was just a cry.",
    "A cry for help Oh no.",
    "Just a sort of shout you\nknow.",
    "In fact I wasnt quite sure I heard it.",
    "A startled kind of cry\nThats more like it said Bobby gratefully.",
    "Sort of noise a fellow\n\n\fmight let out if a ball hit him unexpectedly.",
    "Or if he took a step into\nnothingness when he thought he was on a path Yes.",
    "Then having\nexplained that the man actually died about five minutes after the\ndoctor left to get help Bobbys ordeal came to an end.",
    "The coroner was by now anxious to get on with a perfectly\nstraightforward business.",
    "Mrs Leo Cayman was called.",
    "Bobby gave a gasp of acute disappointment.",
    "Where was the face of\nthe photo that had tumbled from the dead mans pocket\nPhotographers thought Bobby disgustedly were the worst kind of\nliars.",
    "The photo obviously must have been taken some years ago\nbut even then it was hard to believe that that charming wideeyed\nbeauty could have become this brazenlooking woman with plucked\neyebrows and obviously dyed hair.",
    "Time thought Bobby suddenly\nwas a very frightening thing.",
    "What would Frankie for instance look\nlike in twenty years time He gave a little shiver.",
    "Meanwhile\n\nAmelia\n\nCayman\n\nof\n\n17\n\nSt\n\nLeonards\n\nGardens\n\nPaddington was giving evidence.",
    "Deceased was her only brother Alexander Pritchard.",
    "She had last\nseen her brother the day before the tragedy when he had\nannounced his intention of going for a walking tour in Wales.",
    "Her\nbrother had recently returned from the East.",
    "Did he seem in a happy and normal state of mind Oh quite.",
    "Alex\nwas always cheerful.",
    "So far as you know he had nothing on his\n\n\fmind Oh Im sure he hadnt.",
    "He was looking forward to his trip.",
    "There have been no money troubles  or other troubles of any kind\nin his life recently Well really I couldnt say as to that said Mrs\nCayman.",
    "You see hed only just come back and before that I hadnt seen\nhim for ten years and he was never one much for writing.",
    "But he took me out to theatres and lunches in London and gave me\none or two presents so I dont think he could have been short of\nmoney and he was in such good spirits that I dont think there\ncould have been anything else.",
    "What was your brothers\nprofession Mrs Cayman The lady seemed slightly embarrassed.",
    "Well I cant say I rightly know.",
    "Prospecting  thats what he called\nit.",
    "He was very seldom in England.",
    "You know of no reason which\nshould cause him to take his own life Oh no and I cant believe\nthat he did such a thing.",
    "It must have been an accident.",
    "How do\nyou explain the fact that your brother had no luggage with him  not\neven a knapsack He didnt like carrying a knapsack.",
    "He meant to\npost parcels alternate days.",
    "He posted one the day before he left\nwith his night things and a pair of socks only he addressed it to\nDerbyshire instead of Denbighshire so it only got here today.",
    "Ah\nThat clears up a somewhat curious point.",
    "Mrs Cayman went on to\nexplain how she had been communicated with through the\nphotographers whose name was on the photo her brother had\ncarried.",
    "She had come down with her husband to Marchbolt and\nhad at once recognized the body as that of her brother.",
    "As she said the last words she sniffed audibly and began to cry.",
    "The coroner said a few soothing words and dismissed her.",
    "Then he address the jury.",
    "Their task was to state how this man\ncame by his death.",
    "Fortunately the matter appeared to be quite\nsimple.",
    "There was no suggestion that Mr Pritchard had been\nworried or depressed or in a state of mind where he would be likely\nto take his own life.",
    "On the contrary he had been in good health\nand spirits and had been looking forward to his holiday.",
    "It was\nunfortunately the case that when a sea mist was rising the path\nalong the cliff was a dangerous one and possibly they might agree\nwith him that it was time something was done about it.",
    "The jurys verdict was prompt.",
    "We find that the deceased came to his death by misadventure and\nwe wish to add a rider that in our opinion the Town Council should\nimmediately take steps to put a fence or rail on the sea side of the\npath where it skirts the chasm.",
    "The coroner nodded approval.",
    "The inquest was over.",
    "CHAPTER 5 Mr and Mrs Cayman\n\nOn arriving back at the Vicarage about half an hour later Bobby\nfound that his connection with the death of Alex Pritchard was not\nyet quite over.",
    "He was informed that Mr and Mrs Cayman had called\nto see him and were in the study with his father.",
    "Bobby made his\nway\n\nthere\n\nand\n\nfound\n\nhis\n\nfather\n\nbravely\n\nmaking\n\nconversation without apparently much enjoying his task.",
    "suitable\n\n\fAh he said with some slight relief.",
    "Here is Bobby.",
    "Mr Cayman\nrose and advanced towards the young man with outstretched hand.",
    "Mr Cayman was a big florid man with a wouldbe hearty manner and\na cold and somewhat shifty eye that rather belied the manner.",
    "As\nfor Mrs Cayman though she might be considered attractive in a\nbold coarse fashion she had little now in common with that early\nphotograph of herself and no trace of that wistful expression\nremained.",
    "In fact Bobby reflected if she had not recognized her\nown photograph it seemed doubtful if anyone else would have\ndone so.",
    "I came down with the wife said Mr Cayman enclosing Bobbys\nhand in a firm and painful grip.",
    "Had to stand by you know Amelias\nnaturally upset.",
    "Mrs Cayman sniffed.",
    "We came round to see you continued Mr Cayman.",
    "You see my\npoor wifes brother died practically speaking in your arms.",
    "Naturally she wanted to know all you could tell her of his last\nmoments.",
    "Absolutely said Bobby unhappily.",
    "Oh absolutely.",
    "He\ngrinned nervously and was immediately aware of his fathers sigh a sigh of Christian resignation.",
    "Poor Alex said Mrs Cayman dabbing her eyes.",
    "Poor poor Alex.",
    "I\nknow said Bobby.",
    "Absolutely grim.",
    "He wriggled uncomfortably.",
    "You see said Mrs Cayman looking hopefully at Bobby if he left\nany last words or messages naturally I want to know.",
    "Oh rather\nsaid Bobby.",
    "But as a matter of fact he didnt.",
    "Nothing at all Mrs\n\n\fCayman\n\nlooked\n\ndisappointed\n\nand\n\nincredulous.",
    "Bobby\n\nfelt\n\napologetic.",
    "No  well  as a matter of fact nothing at all.",
    "It was best so said\nMr Cayman solemnly.",
    "To pass away unconscious  without pain why you must think of it as a mercy Amelia.",
    "I suppose I must\nsaid Mrs Cayman.",
    "You dont think he felt any pain Im sure he\ndidnt said Bobby.",
    "Mrs Cayman sighed deeply.",
    "Well thats something to be thankful for.",
    "Perhaps I did hope hed\nleft a last message but I can see that its best as it is.",
    "Poor Alex.",
    "Such a fine outofdoor man.",
    "Yes wasnt he said\nBobby.",
    "He recalled the bronze face the deep blue eyes.",
    "An\nattractive personality that of Alex Pritchard attractive even so\nnear death.",
    "Strange that he should be the brother of Mrs Cayman\nand the brotherinlaw of Mr Cayman.",
    "He had been worthy Bobby\nfelt of better things.",
    "Well were very much indebted to you Im sure said Mrs Cayman.",
    "Oh thats all right said Bobby.",
    "I mean  well couldnt do anything\nelse  I mean  He floundered hopelessly.",
    "We shant forget it said Mr Cayman.",
    "Bobby suffered once more\nthat painful grip.",
    "He received a flabby hand from Mrs Cayman.",
    "His\nfather made further adieus.",
    "Bobby accompanied the Caymans to\nthe front door.",
    "And what do you do with yourself young man inquired Cayman.",
    "Home on leave  something of that kind I spend most of my time\nlooking for a job said Bobby.",
    "He paused.",
    "I was in the Navy.",
    "Hard\ntimes  hard times nowadays said Mr Cayman shaking his head.",
    "Well I wish you luck Im sure.",
    "Thank you very much said Bobby\npolitely.",
    "He watched them down the weedgrown drive.",
    "Standing there he fell into a brown study.",
    "Various ideas flashed\nchaotically through his mind  confused reflections the photograph that girls face with the wideapart eyes and the misty hair  and ten\nor fifteen years later Mrs Cayman with her heavy makeup her\nplucked eyebrows those wideapart eyes sunk in between folds of\nflesh till they looked like pigs eyes and her violent hennatinted\nhair.",
    "All traces of youth and innocence had vanished.",
    "The pity of\nthings It all came perhaps of marrying a hearty bounder like Mr\nCayman.",
    "If she had married someone else she might possibly have\ngrown older gracefully.",
    "A touch of grey in her hair eyes still wide\napart looking out from a smooth pale face.",
    "But perhaps anyway \nBobby sighed and shook his head.",
    "Thats the worst of marriage he said gloomily.",
    "What did you say Bobby awoke from meditation to become aware\nof Frankie whose approach he had not heard.",
    "Hullo he said.",
    "Hullo.",
    "Why marriage And whose I was making a reflection of a\ngeneral nature said Bobby.",
    "Namely   On the devasting effects of marriage.",
    "Who is\ndevastated Bobby explained.",
    "He found Frankie unsympathetic.",
    "Nonsense.",
    "The womans exactly like her photograph.",
    "When did\nyou see her Were you at the inquest Of course I was at the\ninquest.",
    "What do you think Theres little enough to do down here.",
    "An inquest is a perfect godsend.",
    "Ive never been to one before.",
    "I was thrilled to the teeth.",
    "Of course\nit would have been better if it had been a mysterious poisoning\ncase with the analysts reports and all that sort of thing but one\nmustnt be too exacting when these simple pleasures come ones\nway.",
    "I hoped up to the end for a suspicion of foul play but it all\nseemed most regrettably straightforward.",
    "What bloodthirsty instincts you have Frankie.",
    "I know.",
    "Its\nprobably atavism however do you pronounce it  Ive never been\nsure.",
    "Dont you think so Im sure Im atavistic.",
    "My nickname at\nschool was Monkey Face.",
    "Do monkeys like murder queried\nBobby.",
    "You sound like a correspondence in a Sunday paper said Frankie.",
    "Our correspondents views on this subject are solicited.",
    "You\nknow said Bobby reverting to the original topic I dont agree with\nyou about the female Cayman.",
    "Her photograph was lovely.",
    "Touched up  thats all interrupted Frankie.",
    "Well then it was so much touched up that you wouldnt have\nknown them for the same person.",
    "Youre blind said Frankie.",
    "The\nphotographer had done all that the art of photography could do but\nit was still a nasty bit of work.",
    "I absolutely disagree with you said\nBobby coldly.",
    "Anyway where did you see it In the local Evening\nEcho.",
    "It probably reproduced badly.",
    "It seems to me youre\nabsolutely batty said Frankie crossly over a paintedup raddled\nbitch  yes I said bitch  like the Cayman.",
    "Frankie said Bobby Im\nsurprised at you.",
    "In the Vicarage drive too.",
    "Semiholy ground so to\nspeak.",
    "Well you shouldnt have been so ridiculous.",
    "There was a\npause then Frankies sudden fit of temper abated.",
    "What is ridiculous she said is to quarrel about the damned\nwoman.",
    "I came to suggest a round of golf.",
    "What about it OK\nchief said Bobby happily.",
    "They set off amicably together and their conversation was of such\nthings as slicing and pulling and how to perfect a chip shot on to the\ngreen.",
    "The recent tragedy passed quite out of mind until Bobby holing a\nlong putt at the eleventh to halve the hole suddenly gave an\nexclamation.",
    "What is it Nothing.",
    "Ive just remembered something.",
    "What\nWell these people the Caymans  they came round and asked if\nthe fellow had said anything before he died  and I told them he\nhadnt.",
    "Well And now Ive just remembered that he did.",
    "Not one\nof your brightest mornings in fact.",
    "Well you see it wasnt the sort\n\n\fof thing they meant.",
    "Thats why I suppose I didnt think of it.",
    "What\ndid he say asked Frankie curiously.",
    "He said Why didnt they ask Evans What a funny thing to say.",
    "Nothing else No.",
    "He just opened his eyes and said that  quite\nsuddenly  and then died poor chap.",
    "Oh well said Frankie\nturning it over in her mind.",
    "I dont see that you need worry.",
    "It wasnt\nimportant.",
    "No of course not.",
    "Still I wish Id just mentioned it.",
    "You\nsee I said hed said nothing at all.",
    "Well it amounts to the same\nthing said Franlde.",
    "I mean it isnt like  Tell Gladys I always loved\nher or The will is in the walnut bureau or any of the proper\nromantic Last Words there are in books.",
    "You dont think its worth\nwriting about it to them I shouldnt bother.",
    "It couldnt be\nimportant.",
    "I expect youre right said Bobby and turned his\nattention with renewed vigour to the game.",
    "But the matter did not really dismiss itself from his mind.",
    "It was a\nsmall point but it fretted him.",
    "He felt very faintly uncomfortable\nabout it.",
    "Frankies point of view was he felt sure the right and\nsensible one.",
    "The thing was of no importance  let it go.",
    "But his\nconscience continued to reproach him faintly.",
    "He had said that the\ndead man had said nothing.",
    "That wasnt true.",
    "It was all very trivial and silly but he couldnt feel\nquite comfortable about it.",
    "Finally that evening on an impulse he sat down and wrote to Mr\nCayman.",
    "Dear Mr Cayman I have just remembered that your brotherinlaw\ndid actually say something before he died.",
    "I think the exact words\nwere Why didnt they ask Evans I apologizeor not mentioning\nthis this morning but I attached no importance to the words at the\ntime and so I suppose they slipped my memory.",
    "Yours truly Robert Jones.",
    "On the next day but one he received a reply Dear Mr Jones wrote\nMr CaymanJ Your letter of 6th instant to hand.",
    "Many thanks for\nrepeating my poor brotherinlaws last words so punctiliously in\nspite of their trivial character.",
    "What my wife hoped was that her\nbrother might have left her some last message.",
    "Still thank you for\nbeing so conscientious.",
    "Yours faithfully Leo Cayman.",
    "Bobby felt snubbed.",
    "CHAPTER 6 End of a Picnic\n\nOn the following day Bobby received a letter of quite a different\nnature Its all fixed old boy wrote Badger in an illiterate scrawl\nwhich reflected no credit on the expensive public school which had\neducated him.",
    "Actually got five cars yesterday for fifteen pounds\nthe lot  an Austin two Morrises and a couple of Rovers.",
    "At the\nmoment they wont actually go but we can tinker them up\nsufficiently I think.",
    "Dash it all a cars a car after all.",
    "So long as it\ntakes the purchaser home without breaking down thats all they\ncan expect.",
    "I thought of opening up Monday week and am relying\n\n\fonyou so dont let me down willyou old boy I must say old Aunt\nCarrie was a sport.",
    "I once broke the window of an old boy next door\nto her who d been rude to her about her cats and she never got\nover it.",
    "Sent me a river every Christmas  and now this.",
    "We re bound to succeed.",
    "The things a dead cert.",
    "I mean a cars a\ncar after all.",
    "You can pick em up for nothing.",
    "Put a lick of paint on\nand thats all the ordinary fool notices.",
    "The thing will go with a\nBang.",
    "Now dont forget.",
    "Monday week.",
    "Im relying on you.",
    "Yours ever Badger.",
    "Bobby informed his father that he would be going up to town on\nMonday week to take up a job.",
    "The description of the job did not\nrouse the Vicar to anything like enthusiasm.",
    "He had it may be\npointed out come across Badger Beadon in the past.",
    "He merely\ntreated Bobby to a long lecture on the advisability of not making\nhimself liable for anything.",
    "Not an authority on financial or business\nmatters his advice was technically vague but its meaning\nunmistakable.",
    "On the Wednesday of that week Bobby received another letter.",
    "It\nwas addressed in a foreign slanting handwriting.",
    "Its contents were\nsomewhat surprising to the young man.",
    "It was from the firm ofHenriquez and Dallo in Buenos Aires and to\nput it concisely it offered Bobby a job in the firm with a salary of a\nthousand a year.",
    "For the first minute or two the young man thought he must be\ndreaming.",
    "A thousand a year.",
    "He reread the letter more carefully.",
    "There was mention of an exNaval man being preferred.",
    "A\nsuggestion that Bobbys name had been put forward by someone\nsomeone not named.",
    "That acceptance must be immediate and\nthat Bobby must be prepared to start for Buenos Aires within a\nweek.",
    "Well Im damned said Bobby giving vent to his feelings in a\nsomewhat unfortunate manner.",
    "Bobby Sorry Dad.",
    "Forgot you\nwere there.",
    "Mr Jones cleared his throat.",
    "I should like to point out to you  Bobby felt that this process usually a leng one  must at all costs be avoided.",
    "He achieved this\ncourse by a simple statement Someones offered me a thousand a\nyear.",
    "The Vicar remained openmouthed unable for the moment to\nmake any comment.",
    "Thats put him off his drive all right thought Bobby with\nsatisfaction.",
    "My dear Bobby did I understand you to say that someone had\noffered you a thousand a year A thousand Holed it in one.",
    "Dad\nsaid Bobby.",
    "Its impossible said the Vicar.",
    "Bobby was not hurt by this frank incredulity.",
    "His estimate of his own\nmonetary value differed little from that of his father.",
    "They must be complete mutts he agreed heartily.",
    "Who  er  are these people Bobby handed him the letter.",
    "The\nVicar fumbling for his pincenez peered at it suspiciously.",
    "Finally\nhe perused it twice.",
    "Most remarkable he said at last.",
    "Most remarkable.",
    "Lunatics\nsaid Bobby.",
    "Ah my boy said the Vicar.",
    "It is after all a great thing to be an\nEnglishman.",
    "Honesty.",
    "Thats what we stand for.",
    "The Navy has\ncarried that ideal all over the world.",
    "An Englishmans word This\nSouth American firm realizes the value of a young man whose\nintegrity will be unshaken and of whose fidelity his employers will\nbe assured.",
    "You can always depend on an Englishman to play the\ngame  And keep a straight bat said Bobby.",
    "The Vicar looked at his son doubtfully.",
    "The phrase an excellent\none had actually been on the tip of his tongue but there was\nsomething in Bobbys tone that struck him as not quite sincere.",
    "The young man however appeared to be perfectly serious.",
    "All the same.",
    "Dad he said why me What do you mean  why\nyou There are a lot of Englishmen in England said Bobby.",
    "Hearty fellows full of cricketing qualities.",
    "Why pick on me\nProbably your late commanding officer may have recommended\nyou.",
    "Yes I suppose thats true said Bobby doubtfully.",
    "It doesnt\nmatter anyway since I cant take the job.",
    "Cant take it My dear\n\n\fboy what do you mean Well Im fixed up you see.",
    "With Badger.",
    "Badger Badger Beadon.",
    "Nonsense my dear Bobby.",
    "This is\nserious.",
    "Its a bit hard I own said Bobby with a sigh.",
    "Any childish arrangement you have made with young Beadon\ncannot count for a moment.",
    "It counts with me.",
    "Young Beadon is\ncompletely irresponsible.",
    "He has already I understand been a\nsource of considerable trouble and expense to his parents.",
    "Hes\nnot had much luck.",
    "Badgers so infernally trusting.",
    "Luck  luck I\nshould say that young man had never done a hands turn in his life.",
    "Nonsense Dad.",
    "Why he used to get up at five in the morning to\nfeed those beastly chickens.",
    "It wasnt his fault they all got the roop\nor the croup or whatever it was.",
    "I have never approved of this\ngarage project.",
    "Mere folly.",
    "You must give it up.",
    "Cant sir.",
    "Ive promised.",
    "I cant let old Badger\ndown.",
    "Hes counting on me.",
    "The discussion proceeded.",
    "The Vicar\nbiased by his views on the subject of Badger was quite unable to\nregard any promise made to that young man as binding.",
    "He looked\non Bobby as obstinate and determined at all costs to lead an idle\nlife in company with one of the worse possible companions.",
    "Bobby\non the other hand stolidly repeated without originality that he\ncouldnt let old Badger down.",
    "The Vicar finally left the room in anger and Bobby then and there\nsat down to write to the firm of Henriquez and Dallo refusing their\noffer.",
    "He sighed as he did so.",
    "He was letting a chance go here which was\nnever likely to occur again.",
    "But he saw no alternative.",
    "Later on the links he put the problem to Frankie.",
    "She listened\nattentively.",
    "Youd have had to go to South America Yes.",
    "Would you have\nliked that Yes why not Frankie sighed.",
    "Anyway she said with decision.",
    "I think you did quite right.",
    "About\nBadger you mean Yes.",
    "I couldnt let the old bird down could I\nNo but be careful the old bird as you call him doesnt let you in.",
    "Oh I shall be careful.",
    "Anyway I shall be all right.",
    "I havent got any\nassets.",
    "That must be rather fun said Frankie.",
    "\u2022Why I dont know why.",
    "It just sounded rather nice and free and\nirresponsible.",
    "I suppose though when I come to think of it that I\nhavent got any assets much either.",
    "I mean.",
    "Father gives me an\nallowance and Ive got lots of houses to live in and clothes and\nmaids and some hideous family jewels and a good deal of credits at\nshops but thats all the family really.",
    "Its not me.",
    "No but all the\nsame  Bobby paused.",
    "Oh its quite different I know.",
    "Yes said Bobby.",
    "Its quite\ndifferent.",
    "He felt suddenly very depressed.",
    "They walked in silence to the next tee.",

    "Bobby topped his drive and it trickled into the bunker.",
    "Hard lines said Frankie and drove a nice straight ball that sailed\nover it.",
    "By the way she remarked.",
    "We might do something together in\nLondon.",

    "Ill give a beer and sausage party if you prefer it said Frankie\nencouragingly.",
    "Oh look here Frankie whats the good I mean you cant mix your\ncrowds.",

    "Look here Frankie its no good\nand you know it isnt.",
    "Its all right down here.",
    "Theres not much to do\nand I suppose Im better than nothing.",
    "I mean youre always awfully\ndecent to me and all that and Im grateful.",
    "But I mean I know Im\njust nobody  I mean  When youve quite finished expressing your\ninferiority complex said Frankie coldly perhaps youll try getting\nout of the bunker with a niblick instead of a putter.",
    "Have I  oh\ndamn He replaced the putter in his bag and took out the niblick.",
    "Frankie watched with malicious satisfaction as he hacked at the\nball five times in succession.",
    "Clouds of sand rose round them.",
    "Your hole said Bobby picking up the ball.",
    "I think it is said Frankie.",
    "And that gives me the match.",

    "Ive got a lot to do.",
    "Of course.",
    "I\nsuppose you have.",
    "They walked together in silence to the\nclubhouse.",
    "Well said Frankie holding out her hand.",
    "Goodbye my dear.",
    "Its\nbeen too marvellous to have you to make use of while Ive been\ndown here.",
    "See something of you again perhaps when Ive nothing\nbetter to do.",
    "Look here Frankie  Perhaps youll condescend to\ncome to my coster party.",
    "I believe you can get pearl buttons quite\ncheaply at Woolworths.",
    "Frankie  His words were drowned in the\nnoise of the Bentleys engine which Frankie had just started.",
    "She\ndrove away with an airy wave of her hand.",
    "Damn said Bobby in a heartfelt tone.",
    "Frankie he considered had behpved outrageously.",
    "Perhaps he\nhadnt put things very tactfully but dash it all what he had said\nwas true enough.",
    "Perhaps though he shouldnt have put it into words.",
    "The next three days seemed interminably long.",
    "The Vicar had a sore throat which necessitated his speaking in a\nwhisper when he spoke at all.",
    "He spoke very little and was\nobviously bearing his fourth sons presence as a Christian should.",
    "Once or twice he quoted Shakespeare to the effect that a serpents\ntooth etc.",
    "On Saturday Bobby felt that he could bear the strain of home life no\nlonger.",
    "He got Mrs Roberts who with her husband ran the\nVicarage to give him a packet of sandwiches and supplementing\nthis with a bottle of beer which he bought in Marchbolt he set off\nfor a solitary picnic.",
    "He had missed Frankie abominably these last few days.",
    "These older people were the limit...",
    "They harped on things so.",
    "Bobby stretched himself out on a brackeny bank and debated with\nhimself whether he should eat his lunch first and go to sleep\nafterwards or sleep first and eat afterwards.",
    "While he was cogitating the matter was settled for him by his falling\nasleep without noticing it.",
    "When he awoke it was halfpast three Bobby grinned as he thought\nhow his father would disapprove of this way of spending a day.",
    "A\ngood walk across country  twelve miles or so  that was the kind of\nthing that a healthy young man should do.",
    "It led inevitably to that\nfamous remark And now I think Ive earned my lunch.",
    "Idiotic\nthought Bobby.",
    "Why earn lunch by doing a lot of walking you dont\nparticularly want to do Whats the merit in it If you enjoy it then\nits pure selfindulgence and if you dont enjoy it youre a fool to do\nit.",
    "Whereupon he fell upon his unearned lunch and ate it with gusto.",
    "With a sigh of satisfaction he unscrewed the bottle of beer.",
    "Unusually bitter beer but decidedly refreshing.",

    "Gosh said Bobby very much surprised.",
    "If it isnt Frankie Hullo\nBobby Ive brought the usual flowers.",

    "All right.",
    "Go ahead.",
    "Rattle off some\nmore initials.",
    "Do you know my girl that half a grain is a fatal dose\nI ought to be dead about sixteen times over.",
    "Its true that recovery\nhas been known after sixteen grains  still eight is pretty good\ndont you think Im the hero of this place.",

    "He continued to talk.",
    "Any signs of inferiority complex that\nhe had displayed at his last meeting with Frankie had now quite\ndisappeared.",
    "He took a firm and egotistical pleasure in recounting\nevery detail of his case.",
    "Thats enough said Frankie quelling him.",
    "I dont really care\nterribly for stomach pumps.",
    "To listen to you one would think nobody\nhad ever been poisoned before.",
    "Jolly few have been poisoned with\neight grains of morphia and got over it Bobby pointed out.",
    "Dash it\n\n\fall youre not sufficiently impressed.",
    "Pretty sickening for the\npeople who poisoned you said Frankie.",
    "I know.",
    "Waste of perfectly good morphia.",
    "It was in the beer\nwasnt it Yes.",
    "You see someone found me sleeping like the dead\ntried to wake me and couldnt.",
    "Then they got alarmed carried me to\na farmhouse and sent for a doctor  I know all the next part said\nFrankie hastily.",
    "At first they had the idea that Id taken the stuff deliberately.",
    "Then when they heard my story they went off and looked for the\nbeer bottle and found it where Id thrown it and had it analysed  the\ndregs of it were quite enough for that apparently.",
    "No clue as to\nhow the morphia got in the bottle None whatever.",
    "Theyve\ninterviewed the pub where I bought it and opened other bottles and\neverythings been quite all right.",
    "Someone must have put the stuff\nin the beer while you were asleep Thats it.",
    "I remember that the\npaper across the top wasnt still sticking properly.",
    "Frankie nodded\nthoughtfully.",
    "Well she said.",
    "It shows that what I said in the train that day was\nquite right.",
    "What did you say That that man  Pritchard  had\nbeen pushed over the cliff That wasnt in the train.",
    "You said that at\nthe station said Bobby feebly.",
    "Same thing.",
    "But why Darling  its obvious.",
    "Why should anyone\nwant to putyou out of the way Youre not the heir to a fortune or\nanything.",
    "I may be.",
    "Some great aunt Ive never heard of in New\nZealand or somewhere may have left me all her money.",
    "Nonsense.",
    "Not without knowing you.",

    "No one benefits\nby your death so thats ruled out.",
    "Then theres revenge.",
    "You\nhavent seduced a chemists daughter by any chance Not that I\ncan remember said Bobby with dignity.",
    "I know.",
    "One seduces so much that one cant keep count.",
    "But I\nshould say offhand that youve never seduced anyone at all.",
    "Youre\nmaking me blush Frankie.",
    "And why must it be a chemists\ndaughter anyway Free access to morphia.",
    "Its not so easy to get\nhold of morphia.",
    "Well I havent seduced a chemists daughter.",
    "And you havent got any enemies that you know of Bobby shook\nhis head.",
    "Well there you are said Frankie triumphantly.",
    "It must be the man\nwho was pushed over the cliff.",
    "What do the police think They\nthink it must have been a lunatic.",
    "Nonsense.",
    "Lunatics dont wander\nabout with unlimited supplies of morphia looking for odd bottles of\nbeer to put it into.",
    "No somebody pushed Pritchard over the cliff.",
    "A\nminute or two later you come along and he thinks you saw him do it\nand so determines to put you out of the way.",
    "I dont think that will\nhold water Frankie.",
    "Why not Well to begin with I didnt see\nanything.",
    "Yes but he didnt know that.",
    "And if I had seen anything\nI should have said so at the inquest.",
    "I suppose thats so said\nFrankie unwillingly.",
    "She thought for a minute or two.",
    "Perhaps he thought youd seen something that you didnt think was\nanything but which really was something.",
    "That sounds pure\ngibberish but you get the idea Bobby nodded.",
    "Yes I see what you mean but it doesnt seem very probable\nsomehow.",
    "Im sure that cliff business had something to do with\nthis.",
    "You were on the spot  the first person to be there  Thomas was\nthere too Bobby reminded her.",
    "And nobodys tried to poison him.",
    "Perhaps theyre going to said Frankie cheerfully.",
    "Or perhaps\ntheyve tried and failed.",
    "It all seems very farfetched.",
    "I think its\nlogical.",
    "If you get two out of the way things happening in a stagnant\npond like Marchbolt  wait  theres a third thing.",
    "What That job\nyou were offered.",
    "That of course is quite a small thing but it was\nodd you must admit.",
    "Ive never heard of a foreign firm that\nspecialized in seeking out undistinguished exNaval officers.",
    "Did\nyou say undistinguished You hadnt got into the BMJ then.",
    "But\nyou see my point.",
    "Youve seen something you werent meant to see  or so they\nwhoever they are think.",
    "Very well.",
    "They first try to get rid of you by\noffering you a job abroad.",
    "Then when that fails they try to put you\nout of the way altogether.",
    "Isnt that rather drastic And anyway a\ngreat risk to take Oh but murderers are always frightfully rash.",
    "The more murders they do the more murders they want to do.",
    "Like The Third Bloodstain said Bobby remembering one of his\nfavourite works of fiction.",
    "Yes and in real life too  Smith and his wives and Armstrong and\npeople.",
    "Well but Frankie what on earth is it Im supposed to have\nseen That of course is the difficulty admitted Frankie.",
    "I agree\nthat it cant have been the actual pushing because you would have\ntold about that.",
    "It must be something about the man himself.",
    "Perhaps he had a birthmark or doublejointed fingers or some\nstrange physical peculiarity.",
    "Your mind is running on Dr\nThomdyke I see.",
    "It couldnt be anything like that because whatever\nI saw the police would see as well.",
    "So they would.",
    "That was an\nidiotic suggestion.",
    "Its very difficult isnt it Its a pleasing theory\nsaid Bobby.",
    "And it makes me feel important but all the same I\ndont believe its much more than a theory.",
    "Im sure Im right.",
    "Frankie rose.",
    "I must be off now.",
    "Shall I come and see you again\ntomorrow Oh Do.",
    "The arch chatter of the nurses gets very\nmonotonous.",
    "By the way youre back from London very soon My dear as soon\nas I heard about you I tore back.",
    "Its most exciting to have a\nromantically poisoned friend.",
    "I dont know whether morphia is so\nvery romantic said Bobby reminiscently.",
    "Well Ill come tomorrow.",
    "Do I kiss you or dont I Its not catching\nsaid Bobby encouragingly.",
    "Then Ill do my duty to the sick thoroughly.",
    "She kissed him lightly.",
    "See you tomorrow.",
    "The nurse came in with Bobbys tea as she\nwent out.",
    "Ive seen her pictures in the papers often.",
    "Shes not so very like\nthem though.",
    "And of course Ive seen her driving about in her car\nbut Ive never seen her before close to so to speak.",
    "Not a bit haughty is she Oh no said Bobby.",
    "I should never call\nFrankie haughty.",
    "I said to Sister I said shes as natural as\nanything.",
    "Not a bit stuck up.",
    "I said to Sister shes just like you or\nme I said.",
    "Silently dissenting violently from this view Bobby\nreturned no reply.",
    "The nurse disappointed by his lack of response\nleft the room.",
    "Bobby was left to his own thoughts.",
    "He finished his tea.",
    "Then he went over in his mind the possibilities\nof Frankies amazing theory and ended by deciding reluctantly\nagainst it.",
    "He then cast about for other distractions.",
    "His eye was caught by the vases of lilies.",
    "Frightfully sweet of\nFrankie to bring him all these flowers and of course they were\nlovely but he wished it had occurred to her to bring him a few\ndetective stories instead.",
    "He cast his eye over the table beside him.",
    "There was a novel of Ouidas and a copy of John Halifax Gentleman\nand last weeks Marchbolt Weekly Times.",
    "He picked up John\nHalifax Gentleman.",
    "After five minutes he put it down.",
    "To a mind nourished on The Third\nBloodstain The Case of the Murdered Archduke and The Strange\nAdventure of the Florentine Dagger John Halifax Gentleman\nlacked pep.",
    "With a sigh he picked up last weeks Marchbolt Weekly Times. .\n\nA moment or two later he was pressing the bell beneath his pillow\nwith a vigour which brought a nurse into the room at a run.",
    "Whatevers the matter Mr Jones Are you taken bad Ring up the\nCastle cried Bobby.",
    "Tell Lady Frances she must come back here\nat once.",
    "Oh Mr Jones.",
    "You cant send a message like that.",
    "Cant\nI said Bobby.",
    "If I were allowed to get up from this blasted bed\nyoud soon see whether I could or couldnt.",
    "As it is youve got to do\nit for me.",
    "But shell hardly be back.",
    "You dont know that Bentley.",
    "She wont have had her tea.",
    "Now look here my dear girl said\nBobby dont stand there arguing with me.",
    "Ring up as I tell you.",
    "Tell\nher shes got to come here at once because Ive got something very\nimportant to say to her.",
    "Overborne but unwilling the nurse went.",
    "She took some liberties with Bobbys message.",
    "If it was no inconvenience to Lady Frances Mr Jones wondered if\nshe would mind coming as he had something he would like to say to\nher but of course.",
    "Lady Frances was not to put herself out in any\nway.",
    "Lady Frances replied curtly that she would come at once.",
    "Depend upon it said the nurse to her colleagues shes sweet on\nhim Thats what it is.",
    "Frankie arrived all agog.",
    "Whats this desperate summons she demanded.",
    "Bobby was sitting up in bed a bright red spot in each cheek.",
    "In his hand he waved the copy of the Marchbolt Weekly Times.",
    "Look at this Frankie.",
    "Frankie looked.",
    "Well she demanded.",
    "This is the picture you meant when you said it was touched up but\nquite like the Cayman woman.",
    "Bobbys finger pointed to a\nsomewhat blurred reproduction of a photograph.",
    "Underneath it\nwere the words portrait FOUND ON THE DEAD MAN AND BY\nWHICH HE WAS IDENTIFIED.",
    "mrs amelia cayman THE DEAD\nMANS SISTER.",
    "Thats what I said and its true too.",
    "I cant see\nanything to rave over in it.",
    "No more than I.",
    "But you said  I know I\nsaid.",
    "But you see Frankie  Bobbys voice became very impressive\n this isnt the photograph that I put back in the dead mans\npocket...",
    "They looked at each other.",
    "Then in that case began Frankie slowly.",
    "Either there must have been two photographs   Which isnt likely \nOr else  They paused.",
    "That man  whats his name said Frankie.",
    "Bassingtonffrench said Bobby.",
    "Im quite sure\n\nCHAPTER 8 Riddle of a Photograph\n\n\fThey stared at each other as they tried to adjust themselves to the\naltered situation.",
    "It couldnt be anyone else said Bobby.",
    "He was the only person\nwho had the chance.",
    "Unless as we said there were two\nphotographs.",
    "We agreed that that wasnt likely.",
    "If there had been\ntwo photographs theyd have tried to identify him by means of both\nof them  not only one.",
    "Anyway thats easily found out said\nFrankie.",
    "We can ask the police.",
    "Well assume for the moment that\nthere was just the one photograph the one you saw that you put\nback again in his pocket.",
    "It was there when you left him and it\nwasnt there when the police came therefore the only person who\ncould have taken it away and put the other one in its place was this\nman Bassingtonffrench.",
    "What was he like Bobby Bobby frowned\nin the effort of remembrance.",
    "A sort of nondescript fellow.",
    "Pleasant voice.",
    "A gentleman and all\nthat.",
    "I really didnt notice him particularly.",
    "He said that he was a\nstranger down here  and something about looking for a house.",
    "We\ncan verify that anyway said Frankie.",
    "Wheeler  Owen are the only\nhouse agents.",
    "Suddenly she gave a shiver.",
    "Bobby have you thought If Pritchard was pushed over Bassingtonffrench must be the man who did it... Thats pretty\ngrim said Bobby.",
    "He seemed such a nice pleasant sort of fellow.",
    "But you know Frankie we cant be sure he really was pushed over.",
    "You have been all along.",
    "No I just wanted it to be that way\nbecause it made things more exciting.",
    "But now its more or less\nproved.",
    "If it was murder everything fits in.",
    "Your unexpected\n\n\fappearance which upsets the murderers plans.",
    "Your discovery of\nthe photograph and in consequence the need to put you out of the\nway.",
    "Theres a flaw there said Bobby.",
    "Why You were the only person who saw that photograph.",
    "As soon as Bassingtonffrench was left alone with the body he\nchanged the photograph which only you had seen.",
    "But Bobby\ncontinued to shake his head.",
    "No that wont do.",
    "Lets grant for the moment that that photograph\nwas so important that I had to be got out of the way as you put it.",
    "Sounds absurd but I suppose its just possible.",
    "Well then whatever\nwas going to be done would have to be done at once.",
    "The fact that I\nwent to London and never saw the Marchbolt Weekly Times or the\nother papers with the photograph in it was just pure chance  a\nthing nobody could count on.",
    "The probability was that I should say\nat once That isnt the photograph I saw.",
    "Why wait till after the\ninquest when everything was nicely settled Theres something in\nthat admitted Frankie.",
    "And theres another point.",
    "I cant be absolutely sure of course but\nI could almost swear that when I put the photograph back in the\ndead mans pocket Bassingtonffrench wasnt there.",
    "He didnt arrive\ntill about five or ten minutes later.",
    "He might have been watching\nyou all the time argued Frankie.",
    "I dont see very well how he could said Bobby slowly.",
    "Theres really only one place where you can see down to exactly\nthe spot we were.",
    "Farther round the cliff bulges and then recedes\nunderneath so that you cant see over.",
    "Theres just the one place\nand when Bassingtonffrench did arrive there I heard him at once.",
    "Footsteps echo down below.",
    "He may have been near at hand but\nhe wasnt looking over till then  Ill swear.",
    "Then you think that he\ndidnt know about your seeing the photograph I dont see how he\ncould have known.",
    "And he cant have been afraid youd seen him\ndoing it  the murder I mean  because as you say thats absurd.",
    "Youd never have held your tongue about it.",
    "It looks as though it\nmust have been something else altogether.",
    "Only I dont see what it\ncould have been.",
    "Something they didnt know about till after the\ninquest.",
    "I dont know why I say they.",
    "Why not After all the\nCaymans must have been in it too.",
    "Its probably a gang.",
    "I like gangs.",
    "Thats a low taste said Frankie\nabsently.",
    "A singlehanded murder is much higher class.",
    "Bobby\nYes What was it Pritchard said  just before he died You know\nyou told me about it that day on the links.",
    "That funny question\nWhy didnt they ask Evans Yes.",
    "Suppose that was it But\nthats ridiculous.",
    "It sounds so but it might be important really.",
    "Bobby Im sure its that.",
    "Oh no Im being an idiot  you never told\nthe Caymans about it I did as a matter of fact said Bobby slowly.",
    "You didr Yes.",
    "I wrote to them that evening.",
    "Saying of course that\nit was probably quite unimportant.",
    "And what happened Cayman\nwrote back politely agreeing of course that there was nothing in\nit but thanking me for taking the trouble.",
    "I felt rather snubbed.",
    "And two days later you got this letter from a strange firm bribing\n\n\fyou to go to South America Yes.",
    "Well said Frankie I dont know\nwhat more you want.",
    "They try that first you turn it down and the next thing is that they\nfollow you round and seize a good moment to empty a lot of\nmorphia into your bottle of beer.",
    "Then the Caymans are in it Of\ncourse the Caymans are in it Yes said Bobby thoughtfully.",
    "If your\nreconstruction is correct they must be in it.",
    "According to our\npresent theory it goes like this.",
    "Dead man X is deliberately pushed\nover cliff presumably by OF pardon these initials.",
    "It is important\nthat X should not be correctly identified so portrait of Mrs C is put\nin his pocket and portrait of fair unknown removed.",
    "Who was she I\nwonder Keep to the point said Frankie sternly.",
    "Mrs C waits for photographs to appear and turns up as griefstricken sister and identifies X as her brother from foreign parts.",
    "You dont believe he could really have been her brother Not for a\nmoment You know it puzzled me all along.",
    "The Caymans were a\ndifferent class altogether.",
    "The dead man was  well it sounds a\nmost awful thing to say and just like some deadly old retired AngloIndian but the dead man was a pukka sahib.",
    "And the Caymans\nmost emphatically werent Most emphatically.",
    "And then just\nwhen everything has gone off well from the Caymans point of view body successfully identified verdict of accidental death everything\nin the garden lovely you come along and mess things up mused\nFrankie.",
    "Why didn t they ask Evans  Bobby repeated the phrase\nthoughtfully.",
    "You know I cant see what on earth there can be in\nthat to put the wind up anybody.",
    "Ah thats because you dont\n\n\fknow.",
    "Its like making crossword puzzles.",
    "You write down a clue\nand you think its too idiotically simple and that everyone will guess\nit straight off and youre frightfully surprised when they simply\ncant get it in the least.",
    "Why didnt they ask Evans  must have\nbeen a most frightfully significant phrase to them and they couldnt\nrealize that it meant nothing at all to you.",
    "More fools they.",
    "Oh\nquite so.",
    "But its just possible they thought that if Pritchard said\nthat he might have said something more which would also recur to\nyou in due time.",
    "Anyway they werent going to take chances.",
    "You\nwere safer out of the way.",
    "They took a lot of risk.",
    "Why didnt they\nengineer another accident No no.",
    "That would have been\nstupid.",
    "Two accidents within a week of each other It might have\nsuggested a connection between the two and then people would\nhave begun inquiring into the first one.",
    "No I think theres a kind of\nbald simplicity about their method which is really rather clever.",
    "And yet you said just now that morphia wasnt easy to get hold of.",
    "No more it isnt.",
    "You have to sign poison books and things.",
    "Oh of course thats a clue.",
    "Whoever did it had easy access to\nsupplies of morphia.",
    "A doctor a hospital nurse or a chemist\nsuggested Bobby.",
    "Well I was thinking more of illicitly imported drugs.",
    "You cant mix\nup too many different sorts of crime said Bobby.",
    "You see the strong point would be the absence of motive.",
    "Your death doesnt benefit anyone.",
    "So what will the police think A\nlunatic said Bobby.",
    "And thats what they do think.",
    "You see Its\nawfully simple really.",
    "Bobby began to laugh suddenly.",
    "Whats amusing you Just the thought of how sickmaking it must\nbe for them\n\nAll that morphia  enough to kill five or six people  and here I am\nstill alive and kicking.",
    "One of Lifes little ironies that one cant\nforesee agreed Frankie.",
    "The question is  what do we do next said Bobby practically.",
    "Oh lots of things said Frankie promptly.",
    "Such as...  Well  finding out about the photograph  that there\nwas only one not two.",
    "And about Bassingtonffrenchs house\nhunting.",
    "That will probably be quite all right and above board.",
    "Why do you say that Look here Frankie think a minute.",
    "Bassingtonffrench must be above suspicion.",
    "He must be all clear\nand above board.",
    "Not only must there be nothing to connect him in any way with the\ndead man but he must have a proper reason for being down here.",
    "He may have invented house hunting on the spur of the moment\nbut I bet he carried out something of the kind.",
    "There must be no\nsuggestion of a mysterious stranger seen in the neighbourhood of\nthe accident.",
    "I fancy that Bassingtonffrench is his own name and\nthat hes the sort of person who would be quite above suspicion.",
    "Yes said Frankie thoughtfully.",
    "Thats a very good deduction.",
    "There will be nothing whatever to connect Bassingtonffrench with\nAlex Pritchard.",
    "Now if we knew who the dead man really was  Ah\nthen it might be different.",
    "So it was very important that the body\n\n\fshould not be recognized  hence all the Cayman camouflage.",
    "And\nyet it was taking a big risk.",
    "You forget that Mrs Cayman identified\nhim as soon as was humanly possible.",
    "After that even if there had\nbeen pictures of him in the papers you know how blurry these\nthings are people would only say Curious this man Pritchard\nwho fell over a cliff is really extraordinarily like Mr X.",
    "There must\nbe more to it than that said Frankie shrewdly.",
    "X must have been a man who wouldnt easily be missed.",
    "I mean he\ncouldnt have been the sort of family man whose wife or relations\nwould go to the police at once and report him missing.",
    "Good for\nyou Frankie.",
    "No he must have been just going abroad or perhaps\njust come back he was marvellously tanned  like a biggame\nhunter  he looked that sort of person and he cant have had any\nvery near relations who knew all about his movements.",
    "Were\ndeducing beautifully said Frankie.",
    "I hope were not deducing all\nwrong.",
    "Very likely said Bobby.",
    "But I think what weve said so far\nis fairly sound sense  granted that is the wild improbability of the\nwhole thing.",
    "Frankie waved away the wild improbability with an airy\ngesture.",
    "The thing is  what to do next she said.",
    "It seems to me weve got\nthree angles of attack.",
    "Go on Sherlock.",
    "The first is you.",
    "Theyve\nmade one attempt on your life.",
    "Theyll probably try again.",
    "This time we might get what they call a\nline on them.",
    "Using you as a decoy I mean.",
    "No thank you\nFrankie said Bobby with feeling.",
    "Ive been very lucky this time but\nI mightnt be so lucky again if they changed the attack to a blunt\ninstrument.",
    "I was thinking of taking a great deal of care of myself in\n\n\fthe future.",
    "The decoy idea can be washed out.",
    "I was afraid youd\nsay that said Frankie with a sigh.",
    "Young men are sadly\ndegenerate nowadays.",
    "Father says so.",
    "They dont enjoy being\nuncomfortable and doing dangerous and unpleasant things any\nlonger.",
    "Its a pity.",
    "A great pity said Bobby but he spoke with\nfirmness.",
    "Whats the second plan of campaign Working from the Why\ndidnt they ask Evans clue said Frankie.",
    "Presumably the dead\nman came down here to see Evans whoever he was.",
    "Now if we\ncould find Evans  How many Evanses Bobby interrupted do you\nthink there are in Marchbolt Seven hundred I should think\nadmitted Frankie.",
    "At least We might do something that way but Im rather doubtful.",
    "We could list all the Evanses and visit the likely ones.",
    "And ask\nthem  what Thats the difficulty said Frankie.",
    "We need to know a little more said Bobby.",
    "Then that idea of yours\nmight come in useful.",
    "Whats No.",

    "There we have got something tangible to go upon.",

    "Ill ask Father.",
    "He knows all these county family\nnames and their various branches.",
    "Yes said Bobby.",
    "We might do\nsomething that way.",
    "At any rate we are going to do something\nOf course we are.",
    "Do you think Im going to be given eight grains of\nmorphia and do nothing about it Thats the spirit said Frankie.",
    "And besides that said Bobby theres the indignity of the stomach\npump to be washed out.",
    "Thats enough said Frankie.",
    "Youll be\n\n\fgetting morbid and indecent again if I dont stop you.",
    "You have no\ntrue womanly sympathy said Bobby.",

    "Meanwhile the young man remained very strictly on his guard.",
    "The\neffect of eight grains of morphia was to render their taker extremely\nsuspicious of food and drink and had also induced him to bring to\nLondon a Service revolver the possession of which was extremely\nirksome to him.",
    "He was just beginning to feel that the whole thing had been an\nextravagant nightmare when Frankies Bentley roared down the\nMews and drew up outside the garage.",
    "Bobby in greasestained\noveralls came out to receive it.",
    "Frankie was at the wheel and\nbeside her sat a rather gloomylooking young man.",
    "Hullo Bobby said Frankie.",
    "This is George Arbuthnot.",
    "Hes a doctor and we shall need him.",
    "Bobby winced slightly as he\nand George Arbuthnot made faint recognitions of each others\npresence.",
    "Are you sure were going to need a doctor he asked.",
    "Arent you being a bit pessimistic I didnt mean we should need\nhim in that way said Frankie.",
    "I need him for a scheme that Ive got\n\n\fon.",
    "Look here is there anywhere we can go and talk Bobby\nlooked round him.",
    "Well theres my bedroom he said doubtfully.",

    "No what happens is this\nGeorge is passing also in a car youd better sell us a second one\nsees the accident leaps out and takes charge.",
    "I am a doctor.",

    "George makes his examination and emerges with\nhis verdict.",
    "Happily it is not as serious as he thought.",
    "No bones\nbroken but danger of concussion.",
    "I must on no account be moved\nfor two or three days.",
    "After that I shall be able to return to London.",
    "And then George departs and its up to me to ingratiate myself with\nthe household.",

    "He doesnt know me from Adam.",
    "And Im in a frightfully strong\nposition because Ive got a title.",

    "Im not\njust a stray young woman gaining admission to the house for\nmysterious purposes.",
    "I am an earls daughter and therefore highly\nrespectable.",

    "Wait a\nminute though I believe there is a kind you can get stuck on hair by\nhair so to speak that absolutely defies detection.",

    "It doesnt matter what he thinks.",
    "Once Ive got the moustache what do I do Put on a chauffeurs\nuniform and drive the Bentley down to Staverley.",
    "Oh I see.",
    "Bobby\nbrightened.",
    "You see my idea is this said Frankie Nobody looks at a chauffeur\nin the way they look at a person.",
    "In any case Bassingtonffrench\nonly saw you for a minute or two and he must have been too rattled\nwondering if he could change the photograph in time to look at you\nmuch.",
    "You were just a young golfing ass to him.",
    "It isnt like the\nCaymans who sat opposite you and talked to you and who were\ndeliberately trying to sum you up.",
    "Id bet anything that seeing you in\n\n\fchauffeurs uniform Bassingtonffrench wouldnt recognize you\neven without the moustache.",
    "He might just possibly think that your\nface reminded him of somebody  no more than that.",
    "And with the\nmoustache it ought to be perfectly safe.",
    "Now tell me what do you\nthink of the plan Bobby turned it over in his mind.",
    "To tell you the truth Frankie he said generously I think its pretty\ngood.",
    "In that case said Frankie briskly.",
    "Lets go and buy some\ncars.",
    "I say I think George has broken your bed.",
    "It doesnt matter\nsaid Bobby hospitably.",
    "It was never a particularly good bed.",
    "They\ndescended to the garage where a nervouslooking young man with\na curious lack of chin and an agreeable smile greeted them with a\nvague Haw haw haw His general appearance was slightly\nmarred by the fact that his eyes had a distinct disinclination to look\nin the same direction.",
    "Hullo Badger said Bobby.",
    "You remember Frankie dont you\nBadger clearly didnt but he said Haw haw haw again in an\namiable manner.",
    "Last time I saw you said Frankie you were head downward in the\nmud and we had to pull you out by the legs.",

    "Look here cant I be there Ill put on a beard if you\nlike.",
    "Certainly not said Frankie.",
    "A beard would probably ruin\neverything by falling off at the wrong moment.",
    "But I dont see why\nyou shouldnt be a motorcyclist  with a lot of cap and goggles.",
    "What do you think George George Arbuthnot spoke for the\nsecond time All right he said the more the merrier.",

    "Hardly anything ever goes down this road I\nshould imagine but at lunch time we ought to be perfectly safe.",
    "They proceeded for half a mile on the side road and then Frankie\npointed out the place she had selected for the accident to take\nplace.",
    "It couldnt be better in my opinion she said.",
    "Straight down this hill\nand then as you see the road gives a sudden very sharp turn\nround that bulging bit of wall.",
    "The wall is actually the wall of\nMerroway Court.",
    "If we start the car and let it run down the hill it will\ncrash straight into the wall and something pretty drastic ought to\nhappen to it.",
    "I should say so Bobby agreed.",
    "But someone ought\nto be on the lookout at the corner to be sure someone isnt coming\nround it in the opposite direction.",
    "Quite right said Frankie.",
    "We\ndont want to involve anybody else in a mess and perhaps maim\nthem for life.",
    "George can take his car down there and turn it as\nthough he were coming from the other direction.",
    "Then when he\nwaves a handkerchief it will show that all is clear.",
    "Youre looking\nvery pale Frankie said Bobby anxiously.",
    "Are you sure youre all right Im made up pale explained\nFrankie.",
    "Ready for the concussion.",
    "You dont want me to be carried\ninto the house blooming with health.",
    "How wonderful women are\nsaid Bobby appreciatively.",
    "You look exactly like a sick monkey.",
    "I think youre very rude said\nFrankie.",
    "Now then I shall go and prospect at the gate into\nMerroway Court.",
    "Its just this side of the bulge.",
    "Theres no lodge\nfortunately.",
    "When George waves his handkerchief and I wave mine\n\n\fyou start her off.",
    "Right said Bobby.",
    "Ill stay on the running board\nto guide her until the pace gets too hot and then Ill jump off.",
    "Dont\nhurt yourself said Frankie.",
    "I shall be extremely careful not to.",
    "It would complicate matters to\nhave a real accident on the spot of the faked one.",
    "Well start off\nGeorge said Frankie.",
    "George nodded jumped into the second car and ran slowly down\nthe hill.",
    "Bobby and Frankie stood looking after him.",
    "Youll  look after yourself wont you Frankie said Bobby with a\nsudden gruffness.",
    "I mean  dont go doing anything foolish.",
    "I shall\nbe all right.",
    "Most circumspect.",
    "By the way I dont think Id better\nwrite to you direct.",
    "Ill write to George or my maid or someone or\nother to pass on to you.",
    "I wonder if George is going to be a\nsuccess in his profession.",
    "Why shouldnt he Well he doesnt\nseem to have acquired a chatty bedside manner yet.",
    "I expect that\nwill come said Frankie.",
    "Id better be going now.",
    "Ill let you know\nwhen I want you to come down with the Bentley.",
    "Ill get busy with\nthe moustache.",
    "So long Frankie.",
    "They looked at each other for a\nmoment and then Frankie nodded and began to walk down the hill.",
    "George had turned the car and then backed it round the bulge.",
    "Frankie disappeared for a moment then reappeared in the road\nwaving a handkerchief.",
    "A second handkerchief waved from the\nbottom of the road at the turn.",
    "Bobby put the car into third gear then standing on the footboard\nhe released the brake.",
    "The car moved grudgingly forward impeded\nby being in gear.",
    "The slope however was sufficiently steep.",
    "The\nengine started.",
    "The car gathered way.",
    "Bobby steadied the steering wheel.",
    "At the last possible moment he\njumped off.",
    "The car went on down the hill and crashed into the wall with\nconsiderable force.",
    "All was well  the accident had taken place\nsuccessfully.",
    "Bobby saw Frankie run quickly to the scene of the crime and plop\ndown amid the wreckage.",
    "George in his car came round the corner\nand pulled up.",
    "With a sigh Bobby mounted his motor cycle and rode away in the\ndirection of London.",
    "At the scene of the accident things were busy.",
    "Shall I roll about in the road a bit asked Frankie to get myself\ndusty You might as well said George.",
    "Here give me your hat.",
    "He took it and inflicted a terrific dent on it.",
    "Frankie gave a faint\nanguished cry.",
    "Thats the concussion explained George.",
    "Now then lie doggo\njust where you are.",
    "I think I heard a bicycle bell.",
    "Sure enough at\nthat moment a boy of about seventeen came whistling round the\n\n\fcorner.",
    "He stopped at once delighted with the pleasurable\nspectacle that met his eyes.",
    "Ooer he ejaculated as there been an accident No said\nGeorge sarcastically.",
    "The young lady ran her car into the wall on\npurpose.",
    "Accepting as he was meant to do this remark as irony\nrather than the simple truth which it was the boy said with relish\nLooks bad dont she Is she dead Not yet said George.",
    "She\nmust be taken somewhere at once.",
    "Im a doctor.",
    "Whats this place\nin here Merroway Court.",
    "Belongs to Mr Bassingtonffrench.",
    "Hes\na JP he is.",
    "She must be carried there at once said George\nauthoritatively.",
    "Here leave your bicycle and lend me a hand.",
    "Only too willing the\nboy propped his bicycle against the wall and came to assist.",
    "Between them George and the boy carried Frankie up the drive to a\npleasant oldfashionedlooking manor house.",
    "Their approach had been observed for an elderly butler came out\nto meet them.",
    "Theres been an accident said George curtly.",
    "Is there a room I\ncan carry this lady into She must be attended to at once.",
    "The\nbutler went back into the hall in a flustered way.",
    "George and the\nboy followed him up closely still carrying the limp body of Frankie.",
    "The butler had gone into a room on the left and from there a woman\nemerged.",
    "She was tall with red hair and about thirty years of age.",
    "Her eyes were a light clear blue.",
    "She dealt with the situation quickly.",
    "There is a spare bedroom on the ground floor she said.",
    "Will you bring her in there Ought I to telephone for a doctor I am\na doctor explained George.",
    "I was passing in my car and saw the\naccident occur.",
    "Oh how very fortunate.",
    "Come this way will you\nShe showed them the way into a pleasant bedroom with windows\ngiving on the garden.",
    "Is she badly hurt she inquired.",
    "I cant tell yet.",
    "Mrs Bassingtonffrench took the hint and retired.",
    "The boy accompanied her and launched out into a description of\nthe accident as though he had been an actual witness of it.",
    "Run smack into the wall she did.",
    "Cars all smashed up.",
    "There she was lying on the ground with her hat all dinted in.",
    "The gentleman he was passing in his car  He proceeded ad lib till\ngot rid of with a halfcrown.",
    "Meanwhile Frankie and George were conversing in careful\nwhispers.",
    "George darling this wont blight your career will it They wont\nstrike you off the register or whatever it is will they Probably\nsaid George gloomily.",
    "That is if it ever comes out.",
    "It wont said\nFrankie.",
    "Dont worry George.",
    "I shant let you down.",
    "She added\n\n\fthoughtfully You did it very well.",
    "Ive never heard you talk so much\nbefore.",
    "George sighed.",
    "He looked at his watch.",
    "I shall give my examination another three minutes he said.",
    "What about the car Ill arrange with a garage to have that cleared\nup.",
    "Good.",
    "George continued to study his watch.",
    "Finally he said\nwith an air of relief Time.",
    "George said Frankie youve been an\nangel.",
    "I dont know why you did it.",
    "No more do I said George.",
    "Damn fool thing to do.",
    "He nodded to her.",
    "Bye bye.",
    "Enjoy yourself.",
    "I wonder if I shall said Frankie.",
    "She was thinking of that cool impersonal voice with the slight\nAmerican accent.",
    "George went in search of the owner of it whom he found waiting for\nhim in the drawingroom.",
    "Well he said abruptly.",
    "Im glad to say its not so bad as I feared.",
    "Concussion very slight and already passing off.",
    "She ought to stay\nquietly where she is for a day or so though.",
    "He paused.",
    "She\nseems to be a Lady Frances Derwent.",
    "Oh fancy said Mrs\nBassingtonffrench.",
    "Then I know some cousins of hers  the\nDraycotts  quite well.",
    "I dont know if its inconvenient for you to\nhave her here said George.",
    "But if she could stay where she is for\na day or two...",
    "Here George paused.",
    "Oh of course.",
    "That will be all right Dr  Arbuthnot.",
    "By the way\nIll see to the car business.",
    "I shall be passing a garage.",
    "Thank you\n\n\fvery much Dr Arbuthnot.",
    "How very lucky you happened to be\npassing.",
    "I suppose a doctor ought to see her tomorrow just to see\nshes getting on all right.",
    "Dont think its necessary said George.",
    "All she needs is quiet.",
    "But I should feel happier.",
    "And her people\nought to know.",
    "Ill attend to that said George.",
    "And as to the\ndoctoring business  well it seems shes a Christian Scientist and\nwont have doctors at any price.",
    "She wasnt too pleased at finding\nme in attendance.",
    "Oh dear said Mrs Bassingtonffrench.",
    "But shell be quite all right said George reassuringly.",
    "You can\ntake my word for it.",
    "If you really think so Dr Arbuthnot said Mrs\nBassingtonffrench rather doubtfully.",
    "I do said George.",
    "Goodbye.",
    "Dear me.",
    "I left one of my instruments\nin the bedroom.",
    "He came rapidly into the room and up to the\nbedside.",
    "Trankie he said in a quick whisper.",
    "Youre a Christian Scientist.",
    "Dont forget.",
    "But why I had to do it.",
    "Only way.",
    "All right said\nFrankie.",
    "I wont forget.",
    "CHAPTER 12 In the Enemys Camp\n\nWell here I am thought Frankie.",
    "Safely in the enemys camp.",
    "Now its up to me.",
    "There was a tap on the door and Mrs\nBassingtonfFrench entered.",
    "Frankie raised herself a little on her pillows.",
    "Im so frightfully sorry she said in a faint voice.",
    "Causing you all\nthis bother.",
    "Nonsense said Mrs Bassingtonffrench.",
    "Frankie\nheard anew that cool attractive drawling voice with a slight\nAmerican accent and remembered that Lord Marchington had said\nthat one of the Hampshire Bassingtonffrenches had married an\nAmerican heiress.",
    "Dr Arbuthnot says you will be quite all right in a\nday or two if you just keep quiet.",
    "Frankie felt that she ought at this\npoint to say something about error or mortal mind but was\nfrightened of saying the wrong thing.",
    "He seems nice she said.",
    "He was very kind.",
    "He seemed a most\ncapable young man said Mrs Bassingtonffrench.",
    "It was very\nfortunate that he just happened to be passing.",
    "Yes wasnt it Not\nof course that I really needed him.",
    "But you mustnt talk continued\nher hostess.",
    "Ill send my maid along with some things for you and\nthen she can get you properly into bed.",
    "Its frightfully kind of you.",
    "Not at all.",
    "Frankie felt a momentary qualm as the other woman\nwithdrew.",
    "A nice kind creature she said to herself.",
    "And beautifully\nunsuspecting.",
    "For the first time she felt that she was playing a\nmean trick on her hostess.",
    "Her mind had been so taken up with the\nvision of a murderous Bassingtonffrench pushing an unsuspecting\nvictim over a precipice that lesser characters in the drama had not\nentered her imagination.",
    "Oh well thought Frankie Ive got to go through with it now.",
    "But I\nwish she hadnt been so nice about it.",
    "She spent a dull afternoon\nand evening lying in her darkened room.",
    "Mrs Bassingtonffrench\nlooked in once or twice to see how she was but did not stay.",
    "The next day however Frankie admitted the daylight and\nexpressed a desire for company and her hostess came and sat\nwith\n\nher\n\nfor\n\nsome\n\ntime.",
    "They\n\ndiscovered\n\nmany\n\nmutual\n\nacquaintances and friends and by the end of the day Frankie felt\nwith a guilty qualm that they had become friends.",
    "Mrs Bassingtonffrench referred several times to her husband and\nto her small boy.",
    "Tommy.",
    "She seemed a simple woman deeply\nattached to her home and yet for some reason or other Frankie\nfancied that she was not quite happy.",
    "There was an anxious\nexpression in her eyes sometimes that did not agree with a mind at\npeace with itself.",
    "On the third day Frankie got up and was introduced to the master of\nthe house.",
    "He was a big man heavy jowled with a kindly but rather abstracted\nair.",
    "He seemed to spend a good deal of his time shut up in his study.",
    "Yet Frankie judged him to be very fond of his wife though\ninteresting himself very little in her concerns.",
    "Tommy the small boy was seven and a healthy mischievous child.",
    "Sylvia Bassingtonffrench obviously adored him.",
    "Its so nice down here said Frankie with a sigh.",
    "She was lying out on a long chair in the garden.",
    "I dont know whether its the bang on the head or what it is but I\njust dont feel I want to move.",
    "Id like to lie here for days and days.",
    "Well do said Sylvia Bassingtonffrench in her calm incurious\ntones.",
    "No really I mean it.",
    "Dont hurry back to town.",
    "You see she\nwent on its a great pleasure to me to have you here.",
    "Youre so\nbright and amusing.",
    "It quite cheers me up.",
    "So she needs cheering\nup flashed across Frankies mind.",
    "At the same time she felt ashamed of herself.",
    "I feel we really have become friends continued the other woman.",
    "Frankie felt still more ashamed.",
    "It was a mean thing she was doing  mean  mean  mean.",
    "She would give it up Go back to town Her hostess went on It wont\nbe too dull here.",
    "Tomorrow my brotherinlaw is coming back.",
    "Youll\nlike him Im sure.",
    "Everyone likes Roger.",
    "He lives with you Off\nand on.",
    "Hes a restless creature.",
    "He calls himself the neerdoweel\nof the family and perhaps its true in a way.",
    "He never sticks to a job\nfor long  in fact I dont believe hes ever done any real work in his\nlife.",
    "But some people just are like that  especially in old families.",
    "And theyre usually people with a great charm of manner.",
    "Roger is\nwonderfully sympathetic.",
    "I dont know what I should have done\nwithout him this spring when Tommy was ill. What was the matter\nwith Tommy He had a bad fall from the swing.",
    "It must have been\ntied on to a rotten branch and the branch gave way.",
    "Roger was very\nupset because he was swinging the child at the time  you know\ngiving him high ones such as children love.",
    "We thought at first\n\n\fTommys spine was hurt but it turned out to be a very slight injury\nand hes quite all right now.",
    "He certainly looks it said Frankie\nsmiling as she heard faint yells and whoops in the distance.",
    "I know.",
    "He seems in perfect condition.",
    "Its such a relief.",
    "Hes had bad luck in accidents.",
    "He was nearly drowned last winter.",
    "Was he really said Frankie thoughtfully.",
    "She no longer meditated returning to town.",
    "The feeling of guilt had\nabated.",
    "Accidents\n\nDid\n\nRoger\n\nBassingtonffrench\n\nspecialize\n\nin\n\naccidents\n\nshe\n\nwondered.",
    "She said If youre sure you mean it Id love to stay a little longer.",
    "But wont your husband mind my butting in like this Henry Mrs\nBassingtonffrenchs lips curled in a strange expression.",
    "No Henry\nwont mind.",
    "Henry never minds anything  nowadays.",
    "Frankie\nlooked at her curiously.",
    "If she knew me better shed tell me something she thought to\nherself.",
    "I believe there are lots of odd things going on in this\nhousehold.",
    "Henry Bassingtonffrench joined them for tea and\nFrankie studied him closely.",
    "There was certainly something odd\nabout the man.",
    "His type was an obvious one  a jovial sportloving\nsimple country gentleman.",
    "But such a man ought not to sit twitching\nnervously his nerves obviously on edge now sunk in an\n\n\fabstraction from which it was impossible to rouse him now giving\nout bitter and sarcastic replies to anything said to him.",
    "Not that he was always like that.",
    "Later that evening at dinner he\nshowed out in quite a new light.",
    "He joked laughed told stories and\nwas for a man of his abilities quite brilliant.",
    "Too brilliant Frankie\nfelt.",
    "The brilliance was just as unnatural and out of character.",
    "He has such queer eyes she thought.",
    "They frighten me a little.",
    "And yet surely she did not suspect Henry Bassingtonffrench of\nanything It was his brother not he who had been in Marchbolt on\nthat fatal day.",
    "As to the brother Frankie looked forward to seeing him with eager\ninterest.",
    "According to her and to Bobby the man was a murderer.",
    "She was going to meet a murderer face to face.",
    "She felt momentarily nervous.",
    "Yet after all how could he guess\n\nHow could he in any way connect her with a successfully\naccomplished crime\n\nYoure making a bogey for yourself out of nothing she said to\nherself.",
    "Roger Bassingtonffrench arrived just before tea on the following\nafternoon.",
    "Frankie did not meet him till tea time.",
    "She was still supposed to\nrest in the afternoon.",
    "When she came out on to the lawn where tea was laid Sylvia said\nsmiling Here is our invalid.",
    "This is my brotherinlaw.",
    "Lady Frances\nDerwent.",
    "Frankie saw a tall slender young man of something over\nthirty with very pleasant eyes.",
    "Although she could see what Bobby\nmeant by saying he ought to have a monocle and a toothbrush\nmoustache she herself was more inclined to notice the intense\nblue of his eyes.",
    "They shook hands.",
    "He said Ive been hearing all about the way you tried to break\ndown the park wall.",
    "Ill admit said Frankie that Im the worlds\nworst driver.",
    "But I was driving an awful old rattletrap.",
    "My own car was laid up\nand I bought a cheap one secondhand.",
    "She was rescued from the\nruins by a very goodlooking young doctor said Sylvia.",
    "He was rather sweet agreed Frankie.",
    "Tommy arrived at this moment and flung himself upon his uncle with\nsqueaks of joy.",
    "Have you brought me a Homby train You said you would.",
    "You said you would.",
    "Oh Tommy You mustnt ask for things said\nSylvia.",
    "Thats all right Sylvia.",
    "It was a promise.",
    "Ive got your train all right\nold man.",
    "He looked casually at his sisterinlaw.",
    "Isnt Henry coming\nto tea I dont think so.",
    "The constrained note was in her voice.",
    "He\nisnt feeling awfully well today I imagine.",
    "Then she said\nimpulsively Oh Roger Im glad youre back.",
    "He put his hand on\nher arm for a minute.",
    "Thats all right Sylvia old girl.",
    "After tea Roger played trains with\nhis nephew.",
    "Frankie watched them her mind in a turmoil.",
    "Surely this wasnt the sort of man to push people over cliffs\n\nThis charming young man couldnt be a coldblooded murderer\n\nBut then  she and Bobby must have been wrong all along.",
    "Wrong that is about this part of it.",
    "She felt sure now that it wasnt Bassingtonffrench who had pushed\nPritchard over the cliff.",
    "Then who was it\n\nShe was still convinced he had been pushed over.",
    "Who had done it\nAnd who had put the morphia in Bobbys beer\n\n\fWith the thought of morphia suddenly the explanation of Henry\nBassingtonffrenchs peculiar eyes came to her with their pinpoint\npupils.",
    "Was Henry Bassingtonffrench a drug fiend\n\nCHAPTER 13 Alan Carstairs\n\nStrangely enough she received confirmation of this theory no later\nthan the following day and it came from Roger.",
    "They had been playing a single at tennis against each other and\nwere sitting afterwards sipping iced drinks.",
    "They had been talking about various indifferent subjects and\nFrankie had become more and more sensible of the charm of\nsomeone who had like Roger Bassingtonffrench travelled about\nall over the world.",
    "The family neerdoweel she could not help\nthinking contrasted very favourably with his heavy seriousminded\nbrother.",
    "A pause had fallen while these thoughts were passing through\nFrankies mind.",
    "It was broken by Roger  speaking this time in an\nentirely different tone of voice.",
    "Lady Frances Im going to do a rather peculiar thing.",
    "Ive known\nyou less than twentyfour hours but I feel instinctively that youre\nthe one person I can ask advice from.",
    "Advice said Frankie\nsurprised.",
    "Yes.",
    "I cant make up my mind between two different courses of\naction.",
    "He paused.",
    "He was leaning forward swinging a racquet\nbetween his knees a light frown on his forehead.",
    "He looked\nworried and upset.",
    "Its about my brother.",
    "Lady Frances.",
    "Yes He is taking drugs.",
    "I\nam sure of it.",
    "What makes you think so asked Frankie.",
    "Everything.",
    "His appearance.",
    "His extraordinary changes of mood.",
    "And have you noticed his eyes The pupils are like pinpoints.",
    "I had noticed that admitted Frankie.",
    "What do you think it is\nMorphia or some form of opium.",
    "Has it been going on for long I\ndate the beginning of it from about six months ago.",
    "I remember that\nhe complained of sleeplessness a good deal.",
    "How he first came to take the stuff I dont know but I think it must\nhave begun soon after then.",
    "How does he get hold of it inquired\nFrankie practically.",
    "I think it comes to him by post.",
    "Have you noticed that he is\nparticularly nervous and irritable some days at tea time Yes I\nhave.",
    "I suspect that that is when he has finished up his supply and\nis waiting for more.",
    "Then after the six oclock post has come he\ngoes into his study and emerges for dinner in quite a different\nmood.",
    "Frankie nodded.",
    "She remembered that unnatural brilliance\nof conversation sometimes at dinner.",
    "But where does the supply come from she asked.",
    "Ah that I dont know.",
    "No reputable doctor would give it to him.",
    "There are I suppose various sources where one could get it in\nLondon by paying a big price.",
    "Frankie nodded thoughtfully.",
    "She was remembering having said to Bobby something about a\ngang of drug smugglers and his replying that one could not mix up\ntoo many crimes.",
    "It was queer that so soon in their investigations\nthey should have come upon the traces of such a thing.",
    "It was queerer that it should be the chief suspect who should draw\nher attention to the fact.",
    "It made her more inclined than ever to\nacquit Roger Bassingtonffrench of the charge of murder.",
    "And yet there was the inexplicable matter of the changed\nphotograph.",
    "The evidence against him she reminded herself was\nstill exactly what it had been.",
    "On the other side was only the\npersonality of the man himself.",
    "And everyone always said that\nmurderers were charming people\n\nShe shook off these reflections and turned to her companion.",
    "Why exactly are you telling me this she asked frankly.",
    "Because I dont know what to do about Sylvia he said simply.",
    "You think she doesnt know Of course she doesnt know.",
    "Ought I\nto tell her Its very difficult  It is difficult.",
    "Thats why I thought you\nmight be able to help me.",
    "Sylvia has taken a great fancy to you.",
    "She\ndoesnt care much for any of the people round about but she liked\nyou at once she tells me.",
    "What ought I to do.",
    "Lady Frances By\n\n\ftelling her I shall add a great burden to her life.",
    "If she knew she\nmight have some influence suggested Frankie.",
    "I doubt it.",
    "When its a case of drugtaking nobody even the\nnearest and dearest has any influence.",
    "Thats rather a hopeless\npoint of view isnt it Its a fact.",
    "There are ways of course.",
    "If\nHenry would only consent to go in for a cure  theres a place\nactually near here.",
    "Run by a Dr Nicholson.",
    "But hed never consent would he He\nmight.",
    "You can catch a morphia taker in a mood of extravagant\nremorse sometimes when theyd do anything to cure themselves.",
    "Im inclined to think that Henry might be got to that frame of mind\nmore easily if he thought Sylvia didnt know  if her knowing was\nheld over him as a kind of threat.",
    "If the cure was successful theyd\ncall it nerves of course she never need know.",
    "Would he have to\ngo away for the cure The place I mean is about three miles from\nhere the other side of the village.",
    "Its run by a Canadian  Dr\nNicholson.",
    "A very clever man I believe.",
    "And fortunately.",
    "Henry\nlikes him.",
    "Hush  here comes Sylvia.",
    "Mrs Bassingtonffrench joined them\nobserving Have you been very energetic Three sets said\nFrankie.",
    "And I was beaten every time.",
    "You play a very good game\nsaid Roger.",
    "Im terribly lazy about tennis said Sylvia.",
    "We must ask the\nNicholsons over one day.",
    "Shes very fond of a game.",
    "Why what is\nit She had caught the glance the other two had exchanged.",
    "Nothing  only I happened to be talking about the Nicholsons to\nLady Frances.",
    "Youd better call her Frankie like I do said Sylvia.",
    "Isnt it odd how whenever one talks of any person or thing\nsomebody else does the same immediately afterwards They are\nCanadians arent they inquired Frankie.",
    "He is certainly.",
    "I rather fancy she is English but Im not sure.",
    "Shes\na very pretty little thing  quite charming with the most lovely big\nwistful eyes.",
    "Somehow or other I fancy she isnt terribly happy.",
    "It\nmust be a depressing life.",
    "He runs a kind of sanatorium doesnt\nhe Yes  nerve cases and people who take drugs.",
    "Hes very\nsuccessful I believe.",
    "Hes rather an impressive man.",
    "You like\nhim No said Sylvia abruptly I dont.",
    "And rather vehemently\nafter a moment or two she added Not at all.",
    "Later on she pointed\nout to Frankie a photograph of a charming largeeyed woman which\nstood on the piano.",
    "Thats Moira Nicholson.",
    "An appealing face isnt it A man who\ncame down here with some friends of ours some time ago was quite\nstruck with it.",
    "He wanted an introduction to her I think.",
    "She\nlaughed.",
    "Ill ask them to dinner tomorrow night.",
    "Id like to know what you\nthink of him.",
    "Him Yes.",
    "As I told you I dislike him and yet hes\nquite an attractivelooking man.",
    "Something in her tone made\nFrankie look at her quickly but Sylvia Bassingtonffrench had\nturned away and was taking some dead flowers out of a vase.",
    "I must collect my ideas thought Frankie as she drew a comb\nthrough her thick dark hair when dressing for dinner that night.",
    "And she added resolutely its time I made a few experiments.",
    "Was or was not Roger Bassingtonffrench the villain she and\nBobby assumed him to be\n\nShe and Bobby had agreed that whoever had tried to put the latter\nout of the way must have easy access to morphia.",
    "Now in a way this\nheld good for Roger Bassingtonffrench.",
    "If his brother received\nsupplies of morphia by post it would be easy enough for Roger to\nabstract a packet and use it for his own purposes.",
    "Mem.",
    "wrote Frankie on a sheet of paper\n\n1 Find out where Roger was on the 16th  day when Bobby was\npoisoned.",
    "She thought she saw her way to doing that fairly clearly.",
    "2 she wrote.",
    "Produce picture of dead man and observe\nreactions if any.",
    "Also noteifR.B.F.",
    "admits being in Marchbolt then.",
    "She felt slightly nervous over the second resolution.",
    "It meant\ncoming out into the open.",
    "On the other hand the tragedy had\nhappened in her own part of the world and to mention it casually\nwould be the most natural thing in the world.",
    "She crumpled up the sheet of paper and burnt it.",
    "She managed to introduce the first point fairly naturally at dinner.",
    "You know she said frankly to Roger.",
    "I cant help feeling that weve\nmet before.",
    "And it wasnt very long ago either.",
    "It wasnt by any\nchance at that party of Lady Shanes at Claridges.",
    "On the 16th it\nwas.",
    "It couldnt have been on the 16th said Sylvia quickly.",
    "Roger was here then.",
    "I remember because we had a childrens\nparty that day and what I should have done without Roger I simply\ndont know.",
    "She gave a grateful glance at her brotherinlaw and he\nsmiled back at her.",
    "I dont feel Ive ever met you before he said thoughtfully to\nFrankie and added Im sure if I had Id remember it.",
    "He said it\nrather nicely.",
    "One point settled thought Frankie.",
    "Roger Bassingtonffrench was\nnot in Wales on the day that Bobby was poisoned.",
    "The second point\ncame up fairly easily later.",
    "Frankie led the talk to country places\nthe dullness thereof and the interest aroused by any local\nexcitement.",
    "We had a man fall over the cliff last month she remarked.",
    "We were all thrilled to the core.",
    "I went to the inquest full of\nexcitement but it was all rather dull really.",
    "Was that a place called\nMarchbolt asked Sylvia suddenly.",
    "Frankie nodded.",
    "Derwent Castle is only about seven miles from Marchbolt she\nexplained.",
    "Roger that must have been your man cried Sylvia.",
    "Frankie looked inquiringly at him.",
    "I was actually in at the death said Roger.",
    "I stayed with the body\ntill the police came.",
    "I thought one of the Vicars sons did that said\nFrankie.",
    "He had to go off to play the organ or something  so I took over.",
    "How perfectly extraordinary said Frankie.",
    "I did hear somebody\nelse had been there too but I never heard the name.",
    "So it was you There was a general atmosphere of How curious.",
    "Isnt the world small Frankie felt she was doing this rather well.",
    "Perhaps thats where you saw me before  in Marchbolt\nsuggested Roger.",
    "I wasnt there actually at the time of the accident said Frankie.",
    "I\ncame back from London a couple of days afterwards.",
    "Were you at the inquest No.",
    "I went back to London the morning\nafter the tragedy.",
    "He had some absurd idea of buying a house\ndown there said Sylvia.",
    "Utter nonsense said Henry Bassingtonfench.",
    "Not at all said Roger goodhumouredly.",
    "You know perfectly well Roger that as soon as youd bought it\nyoud get a fit of wanderlust and go off abroad again.",
    "Oh I shall\nsettle down some day Sylvia.",
    "When you do youd better settle\ndown near us said Sylvia.",
    "Not go off to Wales.",
    "Roger laughed.",
    "Then he turned to Frankie.",
    "Any points of interest about the accident It didnt turn out to be\nsuicide or anything Oh no it was all painfully above board and\nsome appalling relations came and identified the man.",
    "He was on a\nwalking tour it seems.",
    "Very sad really because he was awfully\ngoodlooking.",
    "Did you see his picture in the papers I think I did said Sylvia\nvaguely.",
    "But I dont remember.",
    "Ive got a cutting upstairs from our\nlocal paper.",
    "Frankie was all eagerness.",
    "She ran upstairs and came\ndown with the cutting in her hand.",
    "She gave it to Sylvia.",
    "Roger\ncame and looked over Sylvias shoulder.",
    "Dont you think hes goodlooking she demanded in a rather\nschoolgirl manner.",
    "He is rather said Sylvia.",
    "He looks very like that man Alan\nCarstairs dont you think so Roger I believe I remembered saying\nso at the time.",
    "Hes got quite a look of him here agreed Roger.",
    "But there wasnt much real resemblance you know.",
    "You cant tell\nfrom newspaper pictures can you said Sylvia as she handed the\ncutting back.",
    "Frankie agreed that you couldnt.",
    "The conversation passed to other matters.",
    "Frankie went to bed undecided.",
    "Everyone seemed to have reacted\nwith perfect naturalness.",
    "Rogers househunting stunt had been no\nsecret.",
    "The only thing she had succeeded in getting was a name.",
    "The name of Alan Carstairs.",
    "CHAPTER 14 Dr Nicholson\n\nFrankie attacked Sylvia the following morning.",
    "She started by saying carelessly What was that mans name you\nmentioned last night Alan Carstairs was it I feel sure Ive heard\nthat name before.",
    "Oh he was.",
    "Distinctly attractive.",
    "Funny  his being so like the man\nwho fell over the cliff at Marchbolt said Frankie.",
    "I wonder if everyone has a double.",
    "They compared instances\nciting Adolf Beck and referring lightly to the Lyons Mail.",
    "Frankie\nwas careful to make no further references to Alan Carstairs.",
    "To\nshow too much interest in him would be fatal.",
    "In her own mind however she felt she was getting on now.",
    "She was quite convinced that Alan Carstairs had been the victim of\nthe cliff tragedy at Marchbolt.",
    "He fulfilled all the conditions.",
    "He had\nno\n\nintimate\n\nfriends\n\nor\n\nrelations\n\nin\n\nthis\n\ncountry\n\nand\n\nhis\n\ndisappearance was unlikely to be noticed for some time.",
    "A man\nwho frequently ran off to East Africa and South America was not\n\n\flikely to be missed at once.",
    "Moreover Frankie noted although\nSylvia Bassingtonffrench had commented on the resemblance in\nthe newspaper reproduction it had not occurred to her for a\nmoment that it actually was the man.",
    "That Frankie thought was rather an interesting bit of psychology.",
    "We seldom suspect people who are news of being people we have\nusually seen or met.",
    "Very good then.",
    "Alan Carstairs was the dead man.",
    "The next step\nwas to learn more about Alan Carstairs.",
    "His connection with the\nBassingtonffrenches seemed to have been of the slightest.",
    "He had\nbeen brought down there quite by chance by friends.",
    "What was the\nname Rivington.",
    "Frankie stored it in her memory for future use.",
    "That certainly was a possible avenue of inquiry.",
    "But it would be well\nto go slowly.",
    "Inquiries about Alan Carstairs must be very discreetly\nmade.",
    "I dont want to be poisoned or knocked on the head thought\nFrankie with a grimace.",
    "They were ready enough to bump off\nBobby for practically nothing at all  Her thoughts flew off at a\ntangent to that tantalizing phrase that had started the whole\nbusiness.",
    "Evans Who was Evans Where did Evans fit in\n\nA dope gang decided Frankie.",
    "Perhaps some relation of Carstairs\nwas victimized and he was determined to bust it up.",
    "Perhaps he came to England for that purpose.",
    "Evans may have\nbeen one of the gang who had retired and gone to Wales to live.",
    "Carstairs had bribed Evans to give the others away and Evans had\nconsented and Carstairs went there to see him and someone\nfollowed him and killed him.",
    "Was that somebody Roger Bassingtonffrench It seemed very\nunlikely.",
    "The Caymans now were far more what Frankie imagined\na gang of dope smugglers would be likely to be.",
    "And yet  that photograph.",
    "If only there was some explanation of\nthat photograph.",
    "That evening Dr Nicholson and his wife were expected to dinner.",
    "Frankie was finishing dressing when she heard their car drive up to\nthe front door.",
    "Her window faced that way and she looked out.",
    "A tall man was just alighting from the drivers seat of a darkblue\nTalbot.",
    "Frankie withdrew her head thoughtfully.",
    "Carstairs had been a Canadian.",
    "Dr Nicholson was a Canadian.",
    "And\nDr Nicholson had a darkblue Talbot.",
    "Absurd to build anything upon that of course but wasnt it just\nfaintly suggestive\n\n\fDr Nicholson was a big man with a manner that suggested great\nreserves of power.",
    "His speech was slow on the whole he said very\nlittle but contrived somehow to make every word sound significant.",
    "He wore strong glasses and behind them his very paleblue eyes\nglittered reflectively.",
    "His wife was a slender creature of perhaps twentyseven pretty\nindeed beautiful.",
    "She seemed Frankie thought slightly nervous\nand chattered rather feverishly as though to conceal the fact.",
    "You had an accident I hear.",
    "Lady Frances said Dr Nicholson as he\ntook his seat beside her at the dinner table.",
    "Frankie explained the catastrophe.",
    "She wondered why she should\nfeel so nervous doing so.",
    "The doctors manner was simple and\ninterested.",
    "Why should she feel as though she were rehearsing a\ndefence to a charge that had never been made.",
    "Was there any\nearthly reason why the doctor should disbelieve in her accident\n\nThat was too bad he said as she finished having perhaps made\na more detailed story of it than seemed strictly necessary.",
    "But you seem to have made a very good recovery.",
    "We wont admit\nshes cured yet.",
    "Were keeping her with us said Sylvia.",
    "The doctors gaze went to Sylvia.",
    "Something like a very faint smile\ncame to his lips but passed almost immediately.",
    "I should keep her with you as long as possible he said gravely.",
    "Frankie was sitting between her host and Dr Nicholson.",
    "Henry Bassingtonffrench was decidedly moody tonight.",
    "His hands\ntwitched he ate next to nothing and he took no part in the\nconversation.",
    "Mrs Nicholson opposite had a difficult time with him and turned to\nRoger with obvious relief.",
    "She talked to him in a desultory fashion\nbut Frankie noticed that her eyes were never long absent from her\nhusbands face.",
    "Dr Nicholson was talking about life in the country.",
    "Do you know what a culture is.",
    "Lady Frances Do you mean book\nlearning asked Frankie rather puzzled.",
    "No no.",
    "I was referring to germs.",
    "They develop you know in\nspecially prepared serum.",
    "The country.",
    "Lady Frances is a little like\nthat.",
    "There is time and space and infinite leisure suitable\nconditions you see for development.",
    "Do you mean bad things\nasked Frankie puzzled.",
    "That depends.",
    "Lady Frances on the kind of germ cultivated.",
    "Idiotic conversation thought Frankie and why should it make me\nfeel creepy but it does\n\nShe said flippantly I expect Im developing all sorts of dark\nqualities.",
    "He looked at her and said calmly Oh no I dont think so.",
    "Lady Frances.",
    "I think you would always be on the side of law and\norder.",
    "Was there a faint emphasis on the word law\n\n\fSuddenly across the table Mrs Nicholson said My husband prides\nhimself on summing up character.",
    "Dr Nicholson nodded his head\ngently.",
    "Quite right Moira.",
    "Little things interest me.",
    "He turned to Frankie\nagain.",
    "I had heard of your accident you know.",
    "One thing about it\nintrigued me very much.",
    "Yes said Frankie her heart beating\nsuddenly.",
    "The doctor who was passing  the one who brought you in here.",
    "Yes He must have had a curious character  to turn his car before\ngoing to the rescue.",
    "I dont understand.",
    "Of course not.",
    "You were\nunconscious.",
    "But young Reeves the message boy came from\nStaverley on his bicycle and no car passed him yet he comes round\nthe corner finds the smash and the doctors car pointing the same\nway he was going towards London.",
    "You see the point The doctor\ndid not come from the direction of Staveley so he must have come\nthe other way down the hill.",
    "But in that case his car should have\nbeen pointing towards Staverley.",
    "But it wasnt.",
    "Therefore he must\nhave turned it.",
    "Unless he had come from Staverley some time\nbefore said Frankie.",
    "Then his car would have been standing there as you came down\nthe hill.",
    "Was it The paleblue eyes were looking at her very intently\nthrough the thick glasses.",
    "I dont remember said Frankie.",
    "I dont think so.",
    "You sound like a\ndetective Jasper said Mrs Nicholson.",
    "And all about nothing at all.",
    "Little things interest me said\nNicholson.",
    "He turned to his hostess and Frankie drew a breath of relief.",
    "Why had he catechized her like that How had he found out all\nabout the accident Little things interest me he had said.",
    "Was that all there was to it\n\nFrankie remembered the darkblue Talbot saloon and the fact that\nCarstairs had been a Canadian.",
    "It seemed to her that Dr Nicholson\nwas a sinister man.",
    "She kept out of his way after dinner attaching herself to the gentle\nfragile Mrs Nicholson.",
    "She noticed that all the time Mrs Nicholsons\neyes still watched her husband.",
    "Was it love Frankie wondered or\nfear\n\nNicholson devoted himself to Sylvia and at halfpast ten he caught\nhis wifes eye and they rose to go.",
    "Well said Roger after they had gone what do you think of our Dr\nNicholson A very forceful personality hasnt he Im like Sylvia\nsaid Frankie.",
    "I dont think I like him very much.",
    "I like her better.",
    "Goodlooking but rather a little idiot said Roger.",
    "She either\nworships him or is scared to death of him I dont know which.",
    "Thats just what I wondered agreed Frankie.",
    "I dont like him said Sylvia but I must admit that hes got a lot of of.",
    "force.",
    "I believe hes cured drug takers in the most marvellous\nway.",
    "People whose relations despaired utterly.",
    "Theyve gone there as a last hope and come out absolutely cured.",
    "Yes cried Henry Bassingtonffrench suddenly.",
    "And do you know\nwhat goes on there Do you know the awful suffering and mental\ntorment A mans used to a drug and they cut him off it  cut him off\nit  till he goes raving mad for the lack of it and beats his head\nagainst the wall.",
    "Thats what he does  your forceful doctor\ntortures people  tortures them  sends them to Hell  drives them\nmad...",
    "He was shaking violently.",
    "Suddenly he turned and left the\nroom.",
    "Sylvia Bassingtonffrench looked startled.",
    "What is the matter with Henry she said wonderingly.",
    "He seems\nvery upset.",
    "Frankie and Roger dared not look at each other.",
    "Hes not looked well all evening ventured Frankie.",
    "No.",
    "I noticed that.",
    "Hes very moody lately.",
    "I wish he hadnt given up\nriding.",
    "Oh by the way Dr Nicholson invited Tommy over tomorrow\nbut I dont like him going there very much not with all those queer\nnerve cases and dopetakers.",
    "I dont suppose the doctor would\nallow him to come into contact with them said Roger.",
    "He seems\nvery fond of children.",
    "Yes I think its a disappointment he hasnt\ngot any of his own.",
    "Probably to her too.",
    "She looks very sad  and\nterribly delicate.",
    "Shes like a sad Madonna said Frankie.",
    "Yes that describes her very well.",
    "If Dr Nicholson is so fond of\nchildren I suppose he came to your childrens party said Frankie\ncarelessly.",
    "Unfortunately he was away for a day or two just then.",
    "I think he had\nto go to London for some conference.",
    "I see.",
    "They went up to bed.",
    "Before she went to sleep Frankie wrote to Bobby.",
    "CHAPTER 15 A Discovery\n\nBobby had had an irksome time.",
    "His forced inaction was\nexceedingly trying.",
    "He hated staying quietly in London and doing\nnothing.",
    "He had been rung up on the telephone by George Arbuthnot who in\na few laconic words told him that all had gone well.",
    "A couple of\ndays later he had a letter from Frankie delivered to him by her\nmaid the letter having gone under cover to her at Lord\nMarchingtons town house.",
    "Since then he had heard nothing.",
    "Letter for you called out Badger.",
    "Bobby came forward excitedly but the letter was one addressed in\nhis fathers handwriting and postmarked Marchbolt.",
    "At that moment however he caught sight of the neat blackgowned\nfigure of Frankies maid approaching down the Mews.",
    "Five minutes later he was tearing open Frankies second letter.",
    "Dear Bobby wrote Frankie  think its about time you came down.",
    "Ive given them instructions at home that youre to have the Bentley\nwhenever you ask for it.",
    "Get a chauffeurs livery  darkgreen ours\nalways are.",
    "Put it down to father at Harrods.",
    "Its best to be correct\nin details.",
    "Concentrate on making a good job of the moustache.",
    "It\nmakes a frightful difference to anyones face.",
    "Come down here and ask for me.",
    "You might bring me an ostensible\nnote from Father.",
    "Report that the car is now in working order again.",
    "The garage here only holds two cars and as its got the family\nDaimler and Roger Bassingtonffrench s twoseater in it it is\nfortunately full up so you will go to Staverley and put up there.",
    "Get what local information you can when there  particularly about\na Dr Nicholson who runs a place for dope patients.",
    "Several\nsuspicious circumstances about him  he has a darkblue Talbot\nsaloon he was away from home on the 16th when your beer was\ndoctored and he takes altogether too detailed an interest in the\ncircumstances of my accident.",
    "I think Ive identified the corpse\n\nAu revoir my fellow sleuth.",
    "Love from your successfully concussed Frankie.",
    "P.S.",
    "I shall post this myself.",
    "Bobbys spirits rose with a bound.",
    "Discarding his overalls and breaking the news of his immediate\ndeparture to Badger he was about to hurry off when he\nremembered that he had not yet opened his fathers letter.",
    "He did\nso with a rather qualified enthusiasm since the Vicars letters were\nactuated by a spirit of duty rather than pleasure and breathed an\natmosphere of Christian forbearance which was highly depressing.",
    "The Vicar gave conscientious news of doings in Marchbolt\ndescribing his own troubles with the organist and commenting on\nthe unchristian spirit of one of his churchwardens.",
    "The rebinding of\nthe hymn books was also touched upon.",
    "And the Vicar hoped that\nBobby was sticking manfully to his job and trying to make good and\nremained his ever affectionate father.",
    "There was a postscript By the way someone called who asked for\nyour address in London.",
    "I was out at the time and he did not leave his name.",
    "Mrs Roberts\ndescribes him as a tall stooping gentleman with pincenez.",
    "He\nseemed very sorry to miss you and very anxious to see you again.",
    "A tall stooping man with pincenez.",
    "Bobby ran over in his mind\nanyone of his acquaintance likely to fit that description but could\nthink of nobody.",
    "Suddenly a quick suspicion darted into his mind.",
    "Was this the\nforerunner of a new attempt upon his life Were these mysterious\nenemies or enemy trying to track him down\n\n\fHe sat still and did some serious thinking.",
    "They whoever they\nwere had only just discovered that he had left the neighbourhood.",
    "All unsuspecting Mrs Roberts had given his new address.",
    "So that already they whoever they were might be keeping a watch\nupon the place.",
    "If he went out he would be followed and just as\nthings were at the moment that would never do.",
    "Badger said Bobby.",
    "Yes old lad.",
    "Come here.",
    "The next five minutes were spent in\ngenuine hard work.",
    "At the end often minutes Badger could repeat\nhis instructions by heart.",
    "When he was word perfect Bobby got into a twoseater Flat dating\nfrom 1902 and drove dashingly down the Mews.",
    "He parked the Flat\nin St Jamess Square and walked straight from there to his club.",
    "There he did some telephoning and a couple of hours later certain\nparcels were delivered to him.",
    "Finally about halfpast three a\nchauffeur in dark green livery walked to St Jamess Square and\nwent rapidly up to a large Bentley which had been parked there\nabout half an hour previously.",
    "The parking attendant nodded to him  the gentleman who had left\nthe car had remarked stammering slightly as he did so that his\nchauffeur would be fetching it shortly.",
    "Bobby let in the clutch and drew neatly out.",
    "The abandoned Flat still\nstood demurely awaiting its owner.",
    "Bobby despite the intense\n\n\fdiscomfort of his upper lip began to enjoy himself.",
    "He headed\nnorth not south and before long the powerful engine was forging\nahead on the Great North Road.",
    "It was only an extra precaution that he was taking.",
    "He was pretty\nsure that he was not being followed.",
    "Presently he turned off to the\nleft and made his way by circuitous roads to Hampshire.",
    "It was just after tea that the Bentley purred up the drive of\nMerroway Court a stiff and correct chauffeur at the wheel.",
    "Hullo said Frankie lightly.",
    "Theres the car.",
    "She went out to the\nfront door.",
    "Sylvia and Roger came with her.",
    "Is everything all right Hawkins The chauffeur touched his cap.",
    "Yes mlady.",
    "Shes been thoroughly overhauled.",
    "Thats all right\nthen.",
    "The chauffeur produced a note.",
    "From his lordship mlady.",
    "Frankie took it.",
    "Youll put up at the  what is it  Anglers Arms in Staverley\nHawkins.",
    "Ill telephone in the morning if I want the car.",
    "Very good\nyour ladyship.",
    "Bobby backed turned and sped down the drive.",
    "Im so sorry we havent room here said Sylvia.",
    "Its a lovely car.",
    "You get some pace out of that said Roger.",
    "I do admitted Frankie.",
    "She was satisfied that no faintest quiver of recognition had shown\non Rogers face.",
    "She would have been surprised if it had.",
    "She would\nnot have recognized Bobby herself had she met him casually.",
    "The\nsmall moustache had a perfectly natural appearance and that with\nthe stiff demeanour so uncharacteristic of the natural Bobby\ncompleted the disguise enhanced by the chauffeurs livery.",
    "The voice too had been excellent and quite unlike Bobbys own.",
    "Frankie began to think that Bobby was far more talented than she\nhad given him credit for being.",
    "Meanwhile Bobby had successfully taken up his quarters at the\nAnglers Arms.",
    "It was up to him to create the part of Edward Hawkins chauffeur to\nLady Frances Derwent.",
    "As to the behaviour of chauffeurs in private life Bobby was\nsingularly illinformed but he imagined that a certain haughtiness\nwould not come amiss.",
    "He tried to feel himself a superior being and\nto act accordingly.",
    "The admiring attitude of various young women\nemployed in the Anglers Arms had a distinctly encouraging effect\nand he soon found that Frankie and her accident had provided the\nprincipal topic of conversation in Staverley ever since it had\nhappened.",
    "Bobby unbent towards the landlord a stout genial\nperson of the name of Thomas Askew and permitted information to\nleak from him.",
    "Young Reeves he was there and saw it happen declared Mr\nAskew.",
    "Bobby blessed the natural mendacity of the young.",
    "The famous\naccident was now vouched for by an eye witness.",
    "Thought his last moment had come he did went on Mr Askew.",
    "Straight for him down the hill it come  and then took the wall\ninstead.",
    "A wonder the young lady wasnt killed.",
    "Her ladyship takes\nsome killing said Bobby.",
    "Had many accidents has she Shes been lucky said Bobby.",
    "But\nI assure you Mr Askew that when her ladyships taken over the\nwheel from me as she sometimes does  well Ive made sure my last\nhour has come.",
    "Several persons present shook their heads wisely\nand said they didnt wonder and its just what they would have\nthought.",
    "Very nice little place you have here Mr Askew said Bobby kindly\nand condescendingly.",
    "Very nice and snug.",
    "Mr Askew expressed\ngratification.",
    "Merroway Court the only big place in the neighbourhood Well\ntheres the Grange Mr Hawkins.",
    "Not that youd call that a place\nexactly.",
    "Theres no family living there.",
    "No it had been empty for\nyears until this American doctor took it.",
    "An American doctor\nThats it  Nicholson his name is.",
    "And if you ask me Mr Hawkins\nthere are some very queer goings on there.",
    "The barmaid at this\npoint remarked that Dr Nicholson gave her the shivers he did.",
    "Goings on Mr Askew said Bobby.",
    "Now what do you mean by\ngoings on Mr Askew shook his head darkly.",
    "Theres those there that dont want to be there.",
    "Put away by their\nrelations.",
    "I assure you Mr Hawkins the meanings and the shrieks\nand the groans that go on there you wouldnt believe.",
    "Why dont\nthe police interfere Oh well you see its supposed to be all right.",
    "Nerve cases and such like.",
    "Loonies that arent so very bad.",
    "The\ngentlemans a doctor and its all right so to speak  Here the\nlandlord buried his face in a pint pot and emerged again to shake\nhis head in a very doubtful fashion.",
    "Ah said Bobby in a dark and meaning way.",
    "If we knew everything\nthat went on in these places... And he too applied himself to a\npewter pot.",
    "The barmaid chimed in eagerly.",
    "Thats what I say Mr Hawkins.",
    "What goes on there Why one night\na poor young creature escaped  in her nightgown she was  and\nthe doctor and a couple of nurses out looking for her.",
    "Oh dont let them take me back Thats what she was crying out.",
    "Pitiful it was.",
    "And about her being rich really and her relations\nhaving her put away.",
    "But they took her back they did and the\ndoctor he explained that shed got a persecution mania  thats what\nhe called it.",
    "Kind of thinking everyone was against her.",
    "But Ive\noften wondered  yes I have.",
    "Ive often wondered... Ah said Mr\nAskew.",
    "Its easy enough to say  Somebody present said that there\nwas no knowing what went on in places.",
    "And somebody else said\nthat.was right.",
    "Finally the meeting broke up and Bobby announced his intention of\ngoing for a stroll before turning in.",
    "The Grange was he knew on the other side of the village from\nMerroway Court so he turned his footsteps in that direction.",
    "What\nhe had heard that evening seemed to him worthy of attention.",
    "A lot\nof it could of course be discounted.",
    "Villages are usually prejudiced against newcomers and still more\nso if the newcomer is of a different nationality.",
    "If Nicholson ran a\nplace for curing drug takers in all probability there would be\nstrange sounds issuing from it  groans and even shrieks might be\nheard without any sinister reason for them but all the same the\nstory of the escaping girl struck Bobby unpleasantly.",
    "Supposing the Grange were really a place where people were kept\nagainst their will A certain amount of genuine cases might be\ntaken as camouflage.",
    "At this point in his meditations Bobby arrived at a high wall with an\nentrance of wroughtiron gates.",
    "He stepped up to the gates and\ntried one gently.",
    "It was locked.",
    "Well after all why not\n\nAnd yet somehow the touch of that locked gate gave him a faintly\nsinister feeling.",
    "The place was like a prison.",
    "He moved a little farther along the road measuring the wall with his\neye.",
    "Would it be possible to climb over The wall was smooth and\nhigh and presented no accommodating crannies.",
    "He shook his head.",
    "Suddenly he came upon a little door.",
    "Without much real hope he tried it.",
    "To his surprise it yielded.",
    "It was not locked.",
    "Bit of an oversight here thought Bobby with a grin.",
    "He slipped through closing the door softly behind him.",
    "He found himself on a path leading through a shrubbery.",
    "He\nfollowed the path which twisted a good deal  in fact it reminded\nBobby of the one in Alice Through the Looking Glass.",
    "Suddenly without any warning the path gave a sharp turn and\nemerged into an open space close to the house.",
    "It was a moonlit\nnight and the space was clearly lit.",
    "Bobby had stepped full into the\nmoonlight before he could stop himself.",
    "At the same moment a womans figure came round the corner of the\nhouse.",
    "She was treading very softly glancing from side to side with\n or so it seemed to the watching Bobby  the nervous alertness of a\nhunted animal.",
    "Suddenly she stopped dead and stood swaying as\nthough she would fall.",
    "Bobby rushed forward and caught her.",
    "Her lips were white and it\nseemed to him that never had he seen such an awful fear on any\nhuman countenance.",
    "Its all right he said reassuringly in a very low voice.",
    "Its quite all\nright.",
    "The girl for she was little more moaned faintly her eyelids\nhalf closed.",
    "Im so frightened she murmured.",
    "Im so terribly frightened.",
    "Whats the matter said Bobby.",
    "The girl only shook her head and repeated faintly Im so\nfrightened.",
    "Im so horribly frightened.",
    "Suddenly some sound\nseemed to come to her ears.",
    "She sprang upright away from Bobby.",
    "Then she turned to him.",
    "Go away she said.",
    "Go away at once.",
    "I want to help you said\nBobby.",
    "Do you She looked at him for a minute or two a strange\nsearching and moving glance.",
    "It was as though she explored his\nsoul.",
    "Then she shook her head.",
    "No one can help me.",
    "I can said Bobby.",
    "Id do anything.",
    "Tell me\nwhat it is that frightens you so.",
    "She shook her head.",
    "Not now.",
    "Oh quick  theyre coming You cant help me unless you\ngo now.",
    "At once  at once.",
    "Bobby yielded to her urgency.",
    "With a whispered Im at the Anglers Arms he plunged back along\nthe path.",
    "The last he saw of her was an urgent gesture bidding him\nhurry.",
    "Suddenly he heard footsteps on the path in front of him.",
    "Someone was coming along the path from the little door.",
    "Bobby plunged abruptly into the bushes at the side of the path.",
    "He had not been mistaken.",
    "A man was coming along the path.",
    "He\npassed close to Bobby but it was too dark for the young man to see\nhis face.",
    "When he had passed Bobby resumed his retreat.",
    "He felt that he\ncould do nothing more that night.",
    "Anyway his head was in a whirl.",
    "For he had recognized the girl  recognized her beyond any\npossible doubt.",
    "She was the original of the photograph which had so mysteriously\ndisappeared.",
    "CHAPTER 16 Bobby Becomes a Solicitor\n\nMr Hawkins Yes said Bobby his voice slightly muffled owing to\na large mouthful of bacon and eggs.",
    "Youre wanted on the telephone.",
    "Bobby took a hasty gulp of coffee\nwiped his mouth and rose.",
    "The telephone was in a small dark passage.",
    "He took up the\nreceiver..\n\nHullo said Frankies voice.",
    "Hullo Frankie said Bobby incautiously.",
    "This is Lady Frances Derwent speaking said the voice coldly.",
    "Is\nthat Hawkins Yes mlady.",
    "I shall want the car at ten oclock to\ntake me up to London.",
    "Very good your ladyship.",
    "Bobby replaced\nthe receiver.",
    "When does one say my lady and when does one say your\nladyship he cogitated.",
    "I ought to know but I dont.",
    "Its the sort of thing that will lead a real chauffeur or butler to catch\nme out.",
    "At the other end Frankie hung up the receiver and turned\nto Roger Bassingtonffrench.",
    "Its a nuisance she observed lightly to have to go up to London\ntoday.",
    "All owing to Fathers fuss.",
    "Still said Roger youll be back\nthis evening Oh yes Id half thought of asking you if youd give\nme a lift to town said Roger carelessly.",
    "Frankie paused for an infinitesimal second before her answer given with an apparent readiness.",
    "Why of course she said.",
    "But on second thoughts I dont think I will go up today went on\nRoger.",
    "Henrys looking even odder than usual.",
    "Somehow I dont very much like leaving Sylvia alone with him.",
    "I\nknow said Frankie.",
    "Are you driving yourself asked Roger casually as they moved\naway from the telephone.",
    "Yes but I shall take Hawkins.",
    "Ive got some shopping to do as well\nand its a nuisance if youre driving yourself  you cant leave the car\nanywhere.",
    "Yes of course.",
    "He said no more but when the car\ncame around Bobby at the wheel very stiff and correct of\ndemeanour he came out on the doorstep to see her off.",
    "Goodbye said Frankie.",
    "Under the circumstances she did not think of holding out a hand\nbut Roger took hers and held it a minute.",
    "You are coming back he said with curious insistence.",
    "Frankie laughed.",
    "Of course.",
    "I only meant goodbye till this evening.",
    "Dont have any\nmore accidents.",
    "Ill let Hawkins drive if you like.",
    "She sprang in\nbeside Bobby who touched his cap.",
    "The car moved off down the\ndrive Roger still standing on the step looking after it.",
    "Bobby said Frankie do you think it possible that Roger might fall\nfor me Has he inquired Bobby.",
    "Well I just wondered.",
    "I expect you know the symptoms pretty\nwell said Bobby.",
    "But he spoke absently.",
    "Frankie shot him a quick glance.",
    "Has anything  happened she asked.",
    "Yes it has.",
    "Frankie Ive found the original of the photograph You\nmean  the one  the one you talked so much about the one that was\nin the dead mans pocket Yes.",
    "Bobby Ive got a few things to tell\nyou but nothing to this.",
    "Where did you find her Bobby jerked his head back over his\nshoulder.",
    "In Dr Nicholsons nursing home.",
    "Tell me.",
    "Carefully and\nmeticulously Bobby described the events of the previous night.",
    "Frankie listened breathlessly.",
    "Then we are on the right track she said.",
    "And Dr Nicholson is\nmixed up in all this Im afraid of that man.",
    "What is he like Oh big\nand forceful  and he watches you.",
    "Very intently behind glasses.",
    "And you feel he knows all about you.",
    "When did you meet him He\ncame to dinner.",
    "She described the dinner party and Dr Nicholsons\ninsistent dwelling on the details of her accident.",
    "I felt he was suspicious she ended up.",
    "Its certainly queer his going into details like that said Bobby.",
    "What do you think is at the bottom of all this business Frankie\nWell Im beginning to think that your suggestion of a dope gang\nwhich I was so haughty about at the time isnt such a bad guess\nafter all.",
    "With Dr Nicholson at the head of the gang Yes.",
    "This\nnursing home business would be a very good cloak for that sort of\nthing.",
    "Hed have a certain supply of drugs on the premises quite\nlegitimately.",
    "While pretending to cure drug cases he might really\nbe supplying them with the stuff.",
    "That seems plausible enough\nagreed Bobby.",
    "I havent told you yet about Henry Bassingtonffrench.",
    "Bobby\nlistened attentively to her description of her hosts idiosyncracies.",
    "His wife doesnt suspect Im sure she doesnt.",
    "What is she like\nIntelligent I never thought exactly.",
    "No I suppose she isnt very.",
    "And yet in some ways she seems quite shrewd.",
    "A frank pleasant\nwoman.",
    "And our Bassingtonffrench There Im puzzled said\nFrankie slowly.",
    "Do you think Bobby that just possibly we might be\nall wrong about him Nonsense said Bobby.",
    "We worked it all out\nand decided that he must be the villain of the piece.",
    "Because of the\nphotograph Because of the photograph.",
    "No one else could have\nchanged that photograph for the other.",
    "I know said Frankie.",
    "But\nthat one incident is all that we have against him.",
    "Its quite enough.",
    "I suppose so.",
    "And yet  Well I dont know but I have a queer sort\nof feeling that hes innocent  that hes not concerned in the matter\nat all.",
    "Bobby looked at her coldly.",
    "Did you say that he had fallen for you or that you had fallen for\nhim he inquired politely.",
    "Frankie flushed.",
    "Dont be so absurd Bobby.",
    "I just wondered if there couldnt be\nsome innocent explanation thats all.",
    "I dont see that there can be.",
    "Especially\n\nnow that weve actually found\n\nthe girl\n\nin the\n\nneighbourhood.",
    "That seems to clinch matters.",
    "If we only had some\ninkling as to who the dead man was  Oh but I have.",
    "I told you so in\nmy letter.",
    "Im nearly sure that the murdered man was somebody\ncalled Alan Carstairs.",
    "Once more she plunged into narrative.",
    "You know said Bobby we really are getting on.",
    "Now we must try\nmore or less to reconstruct the crime.",
    "Lets spread out our facts\nand see what sort of a job we can make of it.",
    "He paused for a\nmoment and the car slackened speed as though in sympathy.",
    "Then\nhe pressed his foot down once more on the accelerator and at the\nsame time spoke.",
    "First well assume that you are right about Alan Carstairs.",
    "He certainly fulfils the conditions.",
    "Hes the right sort of man he led\na wandering life he had very few friends and acquaintances in\nEngland and if he disappeared he wasnt likely to be missed or\nsought after.",
    "So far good.",
    "Alan Carstairs comes down to Staverley with these\npeople  what did you say their name was   Rivington.",
    "Theres a\npossible channel of inquiry there.",
    "In fact I think we ought to follow\n\n\fit up.",
    "We will.",
    "Very well Carstairs comes down to Staverley with\nthe Rivingtons.",
    "Now is there anything in that You mean did he get\nthem to bring him down here deliberately Thats what I mean.",
    "Or\nwas it just a casual chance Was he brought down here by them\nand did he then come across the girl by accident just as I did I\npresume he knew her before or he wouldnt have had her\nphotograph\n\non\n\nhim.",
    "The\n\nalternative\n\nbeing\n\nsaid\n\nFrankie\n\nthoughtfully that he was already on the track of Nicholson and his\ngang.",
    "And used the Rivingtons as a means of getting to this part of\nthe world naturally Thats quite a possible theory said Frankie.",
    "He may have been on the track of this gang.",
    "Or simply on the\ntrack of the girl.",
    "The girl Yes.",
    "She may have been abducted.",
    "He\nmay have come over to England to find her.",
    "Well but if he had\ntracked her down to Staverley why should he go off to Wales\nObviously theres a lot we dont know yet said Bobby.",
    "Evans said Frankie thoughtfully.",
    "We dont get any clues as to\nEvans.",
    "The Evans part of it must have to do with Wales.",
    "They were\nboth silent for a moment or two.",
    "Then Frankie woke up to her\nsurroundings.",
    "My dear were actually at Putney Hill.",
    "It seems like five minutes.",
    "Where are we going and what are we doing Thats for you to say.",
    "I\ndont even know why weve come up to town.",
    "The journey to town\nwas only an excuse for getting a talk with you.",
    "I couldnt very well\nrisk being seen walking the lanes at Staverley deep in conversation\nwith my chauffeur.",
    "I used the pseudoletter from Father as an\nexcuse for driving up to town and talking to you on the way and\neven that was nearly wrecked by Bassingtonffrench coming too.",
    "That would have torn it severely.",
    "Not really.",
    "Wed have dropped\n\n\fhim wherever he liked and then wed have gone on to Brook Street\nand talked there.",
    "I think wed better do that anyway.",
    "Your garage\nplace may be watched.",
    "Bobby agreed and related the episode of\nthe inquiries made about him at Marchbolt.",
    "Well go to the Derwents town residence said Frankie.",
    "Theres no one there but my maid and a couple of caretakers.",
    "They\ndrove to Brook Street.",
    "Frankie rang the bell and was admitted\nBobby remaining outside.",
    "Presently Frankie opened the door again\nand beckoned him in.",
    "They went upstairs to the big drawingroom\nand pulled up some of the blinds and removed the swathing from\none of the sofas.",
    "Theres one other thing I forgot to tell you said Frankie.",
    "On the 16th the day you were poisoned Bassingtonffrench was at\nStaverley but Nicholson was away  supposedly at a conference in\nLondon.",
    "And his car is a darkblue Talbot.",
    "And he has access to\nmorphia said Bobby.",
    "They exchanged significant glances.",
    "Its not exactly evidence I suppose said Bobby but it fits in\nnicely.",
    "Frankie went to a side table and returned with a telephone\ndirectory.",
    "What are you going to do Im looking up the name Rivington.",
    "She\nturned pages rapidly.",
    "A. Rivington  Sons Builders.",
    "B.",
    "A. C. Rivington Dental Surgeon.",
    "D. Rivington Shooters Hill I think not.",
    "Miss Florence Rivington.",
    "Col.\nH. Rivington D.S.O.",
    "thats more like it  Tite Street Chelsea.",
    "She\ncontinued her search.",
    "Theres M. R. Rivington Onslow Square.",
    "Hes possible.",
    "And theres a William Rivington at Hampstead.",
    "I think Onslow\nSquare and Tite Street are the most likely ones.",
    "The Rivingtons\nBobby have got to be seen without delay.",
    "I think youre right.",
    "But\nwhat are we going to say Think up a few good lies Frankie.",
    "Im not\nmuch good at that sort of thing.",
    "Frankie reflected for a minute or\ntwo.",
    "I think she said thatll you have to go.",
    "Do you feel you could be\nthe junior partner of a solicitors firm That seems a most\ngentlemanly role said Bobby.",
    "t was afraid you might think of\nsomething much worse than that.",
    "All the same its not quite in\ncharacter is it How do you mean Well solicitors never do make\npersonal visits do they\n\nSurely they always write letters at six and eightpence a time or\nelse write and ask someone to keep an appointment at their office.",
    "This particular firm of solicitors is unconventional said Frankie.",
    "Wait a minute.",
    "She left the room and returned with a card.",
    "Mr Frederick Spragge she said handing it to Bobby.",
    "You are a\nyoung member of the firm of Spragge Spragge Jenkinson and\nSpragge of Bloomsbury Square.",
    "Did you invent that firm\nFrankie Certainly not.",
    "Theyre Fathers solicitors.",
    "And suppose\n\n\fthey have me up for impersonation Thats all right.",
    "There isnt any\nyoung Spragge.",
    "The only Spragge is about a hundred and anyway\nhe eats out of my hand.",
    "Ill fix him if things go wrong.",
    "Hes a great\nsnob  he loves lords and dukes however little money he makes out\nof them.",
    "What about clothes Shall I ring up Badger to bring some\nalong Frankie looked doubtful.",
    "I dont want to insult your clothes Bobby she said.",
    "Or throw your\npoverty in your teeth or anything like that.",
    "But will they carry\nconviction I think myself that wed better raid Fathers wardrobe.",
    "His clothes wont fit you too badly.",
    "A quarter of an hour later\nBobby attired in a morning coat and striped trousers of exquisitely\ncorrect cut and passable fit stood surveying himself in Lord\nMarchingtons pier glass.",
    "Your father does himself well in clothes he remarked graciously.",
    "With the might of Savile Row behind me I feel a great increase of\nconfidence.",
    "I suppose youll have to stick to your moustache said\nFrankie.",
    "Its sticking to me said Bobby.",
    "Its a work of art that couldnt be\nrepeated in a hurry.",
    "Youd better keep it then.",
    "Though its more\nlegallooking to be cleanshaven.",
    "Its better than a beard said\nBobby.",
    "Now then Frankie do you think your father could lend me\na hat\n\nCHAPTER 17 Mrs Rivington Talks\n\nSupposing said Bobby pausing on the doorstep that Mr M.\n\n\fR. Rivington of Onslow Square is himself a solicitor That would be\na blow.",
    "Youd better try the Tite Street colonel first said Frankie.",
    "He wont know anything about solicitors.",
    "Accordingly Bobby took\na taxi to Tite Street.",
    "Colonel Rivington was out.",
    "Mrs Rivington\nhowever was at home.",
    "Bobby delivered over to the smart parlourmaid his card on which\nhe had written From Messrs Spragge Spragge Jenkinson\nSpragge.",
    "Very Urgent.",
    "The card and Lord Marchingtons clothes produced their effect\nupon the parlourmaid.",
    "She did not for an instant suspect that Bobby\nhad come to sell miniatures or tout for insurances.",
    "He was shown into a beautifully and expensively furnished drawingroom and presently Mrs Rivington beautifully and expensively\ndressed and made up came into the room.",
    "I must apologize for troubling you Mrs Rivington said Bobby.",
    "But\nthe matter was rather urgent and we wished to avoid the delay of\nletters.",
    "That any solicitor could ever wish to avoid delay seemed so\ntransparently impossible that Bobby for a moment wondered\nanxiously whether Mrs Rivington would see through the pretence.",
    "Mrs Rivington however was clearly a woman of more looks than\nbrains who accepted things as they were presented to her.",
    "Oh do sit down she said.",
    "I got the telephone message just now\nfrom your office saying that you were on your way here.",
    "Bobby\nmentally applauded Frankie for this lastminute flash of brilliance.",
    "He sat down and endeavoured to look legal.",
    "It is about our client Mr Alan Carstairs he said.",
    "Oh yes He may have mentioned that we were acting for him.",
    "Did\nhe now I believe he did said Mrs Rivington opening very large\nblue eyes.",
    "She was clearly of a suggestible type.",
    "But of course I\nknow about you.",
    "You acted for Dolly Maltravers didnt you when\nshe shot that dreadful dressmaker man I suppose you know all the\ndetails She looked at him with frank curiosity.",
    "It seemed to Bobby\nthat Mrs Rivington was going to be easy meat.",
    "We know a lot that never comes into court he said smiling.",
    "Oh I suppose you must.",
    "Mrs Rivington looked at him enviously.",
    "Tell me did she really  I mean was she dressed as that woman\nsaid The story was contradicted in court said Bobby solemnly.",
    "He slightly dropped the corner of his eyelid.",
    "Oh I see breathed Mrs Rivington enraptured.",
    "About Mr Carstairs said Bobby feeling that he had now\nestablished friendly relations and could get on with his job.",
    "He left\nEngland very suddenly as perhaps you know Mrs Rivington shook\nher head.",
    "Has he left England I didnt know.",
    "We havent seen him for some\ntime.",
    "Did he tell you how long he expected to be over here He\nsaid he might be here for a week or two or it might be six months or\na year.",
    "Where was he staying At the Savoy.",
    "And you saw him\nlast  when Oh about three weeks or a month ago.",
    "I cant\nremember.",
    "You took him down to Staverley one day Of course I\nbelieve thats the last time we saw him.",
    "He rang up to know when he\ncould see us.",
    "Hed just arrived in London and Hubert was very put\nout because we were going up to Scotland the next day and we\nwere going down to Staverley to lunch and dining out with some\ndreadful people that we couldnt get rid of and he wanted to see\nCarstairs because he liked him so much and so I said My dear\nlets take him down to the Bassingtonffrenches with us.",
    "They wont\nmind.",
    "And we did.",
    "And of course they didnt.",
    "She came\nbreathlessly to a pause.",
    "Did he tell you his reasons for being in England asked Bobby.",
    "No.",
    "Did he have any Oh yes I know.",
    "We thought it was something\nto do with that millionaire man that friend of his who had such a\ntragic death.",
    "Some doctor told him he had cancer and he killed\nhimself.",
    "A very wicked thing for a doctor to do dont you think so\nAnd theyre often quite wrong.",
    "Our doctor said the other day that\nmy little girl had measles and it turned out to be a sort of heat rash.",
    "I told Hubert I should change him.",
    "Ignoring Mrs Rivingtons\ntreatment of doctors as though they were library books Bobby\nreturned to the point.",
    "Did Mr Carstairs know the Bassingtonffrenches Oh no But I\nthink he liked them.",
    "Though he was very queer and moody on the\nway back.",
    "I suppose something that had been said must have upset\nhim.",
    "Hes a Canadian you know and I often think Canadians are so\ntouchy.",
    "You dont know what it was that upset him I havent the\nleast idea.",
    "The silliest things do it sometimes dont they Did he\ntake any walks in the neighbourhood asked Bobby.",
    "Oh no What a very odd idea She stared at him.",
    "Bobby tried again.",
    "Was there a party Did he meet any of the neighbours No it was\njust ourselves and them.",
    "But its odd your saying that  Yes said\nBobby eagerly as she paused.",
    "Because he asked a most frightful lot of questions about some\npeople who lived near there.",
    "Do you remember the name No I\ndont.",
    "It wasnt anyone very interesting  some doctor or other.",
    "Dr\nNicholson I believe that was the name.",
    "He wanted to know all\nabout him and his wife and when they came there  all sorts of\nthings.",
    "It seemed so odd when he didnt know them and he wasnt a bit a\ncurious man as a rule.",
    "But of course perhaps he was only making\nconversation and couldnt think of anything to say.",
    "One does do things like that sometimes.",
    "Bobby agreed that one did\nand asked how the subject of the Nicholsons had come up but that\nMrs Rivington was unable to tell him.",
    "She had been out with Henry\n\n\fBassingtonffrench in the garden and had come in to find the others\ndiscussing the Nicholsons.",
    "So far the conversation had proceeded easily Bobby pumping the\nlady without any camouflage but she now displayed a sudden\ncuriosity.",
    "But what is it you want to know about Mr Carstairs she asked.",
    "I really wanted his address explained Bobby.",
    "As you know we act\nfor him and weve just had a rather important cable from New York you know theres rather a serious fluctuation in the dollar just now  Mrs Rivington nodded with desperate intelligence.",
    "And so continued Bobby rapidly we wanted to get into touch with\nhim  to get his instructions  and he hasnt left an address  and\nhaving heard him mention he was a friend of yours I thought you\nmight possibly have news of him.",
    "Oh I see said Mrs Rivington\ncompletely satisfied.",
    "What a pity.",
    "But hes always rather a vague\nman I should think.",
    "Oh distinctly so said Bobby.",
    "Well he rose I\napologize for taking up so much of your time.",
    "Oh not at all said\nMrs Rivington.",
    "And its so interesting to know that Dolly Maltravers\nreally did  as you say she did.",
    "I said nothing at all said Bobby.",
    "Yes but then lawyers are so discreet arent they said Mrs\nRivington with a little gurgle of laughter.",
    "So thats all right thought Bobby as he walked away down Tite\nStreet.",
    "I seem to have taken Dolly Whatsemames character away\nfor good but I daresay she deserves it and that charming idiot of a\n\n\fwoman will never wonder why if I wanted Carstairs address I\ndidnt simply ring up and ask for it Back in Brook Street he and\nFrankie discussed the matter from every angle.",
    "It looks as though it were really pure chance that took him to the\nBassingtonffrenches said Frankie thoughtfully.",
    "I know.",
    "But evidently when he was down there some chance\nremark directed his attention to the Nicholsons.",
    "So that really it is\nNicholson\n\nwho\n\nis\n\nat\n\nthe\n\nheart\n\nof\n\nthe\n\nmystery\n\nnot\n\nthe\n\nBassingtonffrenches Bobby looked at her.",
    "Still intent on whitewashing your hero he inquired coldly.",
    "My dear Im only pointing out what it looks like.",
    "Its the mention of\nNicholson and his nursing home that excited Carstairs.",
    "Being taken\ndown to the Bassingtonffrenches was a pure matter of chance.",
    "You\nmust admit that.",
    "It seems like it.",
    "Why only seems Well there\nis just one other possibility.",
    "In some way Carstairs may have found\nout that the Rivingtons were going down to lunch with the\nBassingtonffrenches.",
    "He may have overheard some chance\nremark in a restaurant  at the Savoy perhaps.",
    "So he rings them up\nvery urgent to see them and what he hopes may happen does\nhappen.",
    "Theyre very booked up and they suggest his coming down\nwith them  their friends wont mind and they do so want to see him.",
    "That is possible Frankie.",
    "It is possible I suppose.",
    "But it seems a\nvery roundabout method of doing things.",
    "No more roundabout\nthan your accident said Bobby.",
    "My accident was vigorous direct action said Frankie coldly.",
    "Bobby removed Lord Marchingtons clothes and replaced them\nwhere he had found them.",
    "Then he donned his chauffeurs uniform\nonce more and they were soon speeding back to Staverley.",
    "If Roger has fallen for me said Frankie demurely hell be pleased\nIve come back so soon.",
    "Hell think I cant bear to be away from him\nfor long.",
    "Im not sure that you can bear it either said Bobby.",
    "Ive\nalways heard that really dangerous criminals were singularly\nattractive.",
    "Somehow I cant believe he is a criminal.",
    "So you\nremarked before.",
    "Well I feel like that.",
    "You cant get over the\nphotograph.",
    "Damn the photograph said Frankie.",

    "It was halfpast two.",
    "They dont expect me back for hours yet she thought.",
    "I wonder\nwhere they are She opened the door of the library and went in\nstopping suddenly on the threshold.",
    "Dr Nicholson was sitting on the sofa holding both Sylvia\nBassingtonffrenchs hands in his.",
    "Sylvia jumped to her feet and came across the room towards\nFrankie.",
    "Hes been telling me she said.",
    "Her voice was stifled.",
    "She put both hands to her face as though to\nhide it from view.",
    "Its too terrible she sobbed and brushing past Frankie she ran\nout of the room.",
    "Dr Nicholson had risen.",
    "Frankie advanced a step or two towards\nhim.",
    "His eyes watchful as ever met hers.",
    "Poor lady he said suavely.",
    "It has been a great shock to her.",
    "The\nmuscles at the corner of his mouth twitched.",
    "For a moment or two\nFrankie fancied that he was amused.",
    "And then quite suddenly she\nrealized that it was quite a different emotion.",
    "The man was angry.",
    "He was holding himself in hiding his anger\nbehind a suave bland mask but the emotion was there.",
    "It was all he\ncould do to hold that emotion in.",
    "There was a moments pause.",
    "It was best that Mrs Bassingtonffrench should know the truth\nsaid the doctor.",
    "I want her to induce her husband to place himself\nin my hands.",
    "Im afraid said Frankie gently that I interrupted\nyou.",
    "She paused.",

    "Its a lady.",
    "Youll find her in Mr Askews little sittingroom.",
    "Bobby\nmade his way there slightly puzzled.",
    "Unless she had flown there on\nwings he could not see how Frankie could possibly have got to the\nAnglers Arms ahead of him and that his visitor could be anyone\nelse but Frankie never occurred to him.",
    "He opened the door of the small room which Mr Askew kept as his\nprivate sittingroom.",
    "Sitting bolt upright in a chair was a slender\nfigure dressed in black  the girl of the photograph.",
    "Bobby was so astonished that for a moment or two he could not\nspeak.",
    "Then he noticed that the girl was terribly nervous.",
    "Her small hands were trembling and closed and unclosed\nthemselves on the arm of the chair.",
    "She seemed too nervous even\nto speak but her large eyes held a kind of terrified appeal.",
    "So its you said Bobby at last.",
    "He shut the door behind him and\ncame forward to the table.",
    "Still the girl did not speak  still those large terrified eyes looked\ninto his.",
    "At last words came  a mere hoarse whisper.",
    "You said  you said  youd help me.",
    "Perhaps I shouldnt have come \nHere Bobby broke in finding words and assurance at the same\ntime.",
    "Shouldnt have come Nonsense.",
    "You did quite right to come.",
    "Of\ncourse you should have come.",
    "And Ill do anything  anything in the\nworld  to help you.",

    "Youre quite safe now.",
    "The colour rose a little in the girls face.",
    "She\nsaid abruptly Who are you Youre  youre  not a chauffeur.",
    "I\nmean you may be a chauffeur but youre not one really.",
    "Bobby\nunderstood her meaning in spite of the confused form of words in\nwhich she had cloaked them.",
    "One does all sorts of jobs nowadays he said.",
    "I used to be in the\nNavy.",
    "As a matter of fact Im not exactly a chauffeur but that\ndoesnt matter now.",
    "But anyway I assure you you can trust me and\n and tell me all about it.",

    "You must think me mad she murmured.",
    "You must think me quite\nmad.",
    "No no.",
    "Yes  coming here like this.",
    "But I was so frightened so terribly frightened  Her voice died away.",
    "Her eyes widened as\nthough they saw some vision of terror.",

    "Look here he said its quite all right.",
    "Everythings going to be all\nright.",
    "Youre safe now  with  with a friend.",
    "Nothing shall happen to\nyou.",
    "He felt the answering pressure of her fingers.",
    "When you stepped out into the moonlight the other night she said\nin a low hurried voice it was  it was like a dream a dream of\ndeliverance.",
    "I didnt know who you were or where you came from\nbut it gave me hope and I determined to come and find you  and \n\n\ftell you.",
    "Thats right said Bobby encouragingly.",
    "Tell me.",
    "Tell me\neverything.",
    "She drew her hand away suddenly.",
    "If I do youll think Im mad  that Ive gone wrong in my head from\nbeing in that place with those others.",

    "Her\nvoice was dry and hoarse.",
    "She was speaking with obvious selfrestraint but her hands were trembling.",
    "Murdered Yes that sounds mad doesnt it Like  what do they\ncall it\n\n persecution mania.",
    "No said Bobby.",
    "You dont sound mad at all just frightened.",
    "Tell me who wants to murder you and why She\nwas silent a minute or two twisting and untwisting her hands.",
    "Then\nshe said in a low voice My husband.",
    "Your husband Thoughts\nwhirled round in Bobbys head Who are you  he said abruptly.",
    "It was her turn to look surprised.",
    "Dont you know I havent the least idea.",
    "She said Im Moira\nNicholson.",
    "My husband is Dr Nicholson.",
    "\u2022 Then youre not a patient\nthere A patient Oh no Her face darkened suddenly.",

    "Now go on\n\n\fwith what youre telling me  about your husband wanting to murder\nyou.",
    "It sounds mad I know.",
    "But it isnt  it isnt I see it in his eyes\nwhen he looks at me.",
    "And queer things have happened accidents.",
    "Accidents said Bobby sharply.",
    "Yes.",
    "Oh I know it sounds hysterical and as though I was making it\nall up  Not a bit said Bobby.",
    "It sounds perfectly reasonable.",
    "Go\non.",
    "About these accidents.",
    "They were just accidents.",
    "He backed\nthe car not seeing I was there  I just jumped aside in time  and\nsome stuff that was in the wrong bottle  oh stupid things  and\nthings that people would think quite all right but they werent  they\nwere meant.",
    "I know it.",
    "And its wearing me out  watching for them being on my guard  trying to save my life.",
    "She swallowed\nconvulsively.",
    "Why does your husband want to do away with you asked Bobby.",
    "Perhaps he hardly expected a definite answer  but the answer\ncame\n\npromptly\n\nBecause\n\nhe\n\nwants\n\nto\n\nmarry\n\nSylvia\n\nBassingtonffrench.",
    "What But shes married already.",
    "I know.",
    "But\nhes arranging for that.",
    "How do you mean I dont know exactly.",
    "But I know that hes trying to get Mr Bassingtonffrench brought to\nthe Grange as a patient.",
    "And then I dont know but I think\nsomething would happen.",
    "She shuddered.",
    "Hes got some hold over Mr Bassingtonffrench.",
    "I dont know what\nit is.",
    "Bassingtonffrench takes morphia said Bobby.",
    "Is that it Jasper gives it to him I suppose.",
    "It comes by post.",
    "Perhaps Jasper doesnt do it directly  hes very cunning Mr\nBassingtonffrench maynt know it comes from Jasper but Im sure\nit does.",
    "And then Jasper would have him at the Grange and pretend\nto cure him  and once he was there  She paused and shivered.",
    "All sorts of things happen at the Grange she said.",
    "Queer things.",
    "People come there to get better  and they dont get better  they\nget worse.",
    "As she spoke Bobby was aware of a glimpse into a\nstrange evil atmosphere.",
    "He felt something of the terror that had\nenveloped Moira Nicholsons life so long.",
    "He said abruptly You say your husband wants to marry Mrs\nBassingtonffrench\n\nMoira nodded.",
    "Hes crazy about her.",
    "And she \u00ab\u00bbI dont know said Moira\nslowly.",
    "I cant make up my mind.",
    "On the surface she seems fond of her husband and little boy and\ncontent and peaceful.",
    "She seems a very simple woman.",
    "But\nsometimes I fancy that she isnt so simple as she seems.",
    "Ive even\nwondered sometimes whether she is an entirely different woman\nfrom what we all think she is... whether perhaps she isnt playing a\npart and playing it very well...",
    "But really I think thats nonsense foolish imagination on my part.",
    "When youve lived at a place like the Grange your mind gets\ndistorted and you do begin imagining things.",
    "What about the\nbrother Roger asked Bobby.",
    "I dont know much about him.",
    "Hes nice I think but hes the sort of\nperson who would be very easily deceived.",
    "Hes quite taken in by\nJasper I know.",
    "Jasper is working on him to persuade Mr\nBassingtonffrench to come to the Grange.",
    "I believe he thinks its all\nhis own idea.",
    "She leaned forward suddenly and caught Bobbys\nsleeve.",
    "Dont let him come to the Grange she implored.",
    "If he does\nsomething awful will happen.",
    "I know it will.",
    "Bobby was silent a\nminute or two turning over the amazing story in his mind.",
    "How long have you been married to Nicholson he said at last.",
    "Just over a year  She shivered.",
    "Havent you ever thought of leaving him How could I Ive\nnowhere to go.",
    "Ive no money.",
    "If anyone took me in what sort of\nstory could I tell A fantastic tale that my husband wanted to\nmurder me Who would believe me Well I believe you said\nBobby.",
    "He paused a moment as though making up his mind to a certain\ncourse of action.",
    "Then he went on Look here he said bluntly.",
    "Im\ngoing to ask you a question straight out.",
    "Did you know a man called\nAlan Carstairs He saw the colour come up in her cheeks.",
    "Why do you ask me that Because its rather important that I\nshould know.",
    "My idea is that you d know Alan Carstairs that\n\n\fperhaps at some time or other you gave him your photograph.",
    "She\nwas silent a moment her eyes downcast.",
    "Then she lifted her head\nand looked him in the face.",
    "Thats quite true she said.",
    "You knew him before you were married Yes.",
    "Has he been down\nhere to see you since you were married She hesitated then said\nYes once.",
    "About a month ago would that be Yes.",
    "I suppose it\nwould be about a month.",
    "He knew you were living down here I\ndont know how he knew  I hadnt told him.",
    "I had never even written\nto him since my marriage.",
    "But he found out and came here to see\nyou.",
    "Did your husband know that No.",
    "You think not.",
    "But he might\nhave known all the same I suppose he might but he never said\nanything.",
    "Did you discuss your husband at all with Carstairs Did\nyou tell him of your fears as to your safety She shook her head.",
    "I hadnt begun to suspect then.",
    "But you were unhappy Yes.",
    "And\nyou told him so No.",
    "I tried not to show in any way that my\nmarriage hadnt been a success.",
    "But he might have guessed it all\nthe same said Bobby gently.",
    "I suppose he might she admitted in a low voice.",
    "Do you think  I dont know how to put it  but do you think that he\nknew anything about your husband  that he suspected for\ninstance that this nursing home place mightnt be quite what it\nseemed to be Her brows furrowed as she tried to think.",
    "Its possible she said at last.",
    "He asked one or two rather peculiar\nquestions  but  no.",
    "I dont think he can really have known anything\nabout it.",
    "Bobby was silent again for a few minutes.",
    "Then he said\nWould you call your husband a jealous man Rather to his\nsurprise she answered Yes.",
    "Very jealous.",
    "Jealous for instance\nof you.",
    "You mean even though he doesnt care But yes he would\nbe jealous just the same.",
    "Im his property you see.",
    "Hes a queer\nman  a very queer man.",
    "She shivered.",
    "Then she asked suddenly Youre not connected with the police in\nany way are you I Oh no I wondered I mean  Bobby looked\ndown at his chauffeurs livery.",
    "Its rather a long story he said.",
    "You are Lady Frances Derwents chauffeur arent you So the\nlandlord here said.",
    "I met her at dinner the other night.",
    "I know.",
    "He\npaused.",
    "Weve got to get hold of her he said.",
    "And its a bit difficult for me to do.",
    "Do you think you could ring up\nand ask to speak to her and then get her to come and meet you\nsomewhere outdoors I suppose I could  said Moira slowly.",
    "I know it must seem frightfully odd to you.",
    "But it wont when Ive\nexplained.",
    "We must get hold of Frankie as soon as possible.",
    "Its\nessential.",
    "Moira rose.",
    "Very well she said.",
    "With her hand on the doorhandle she hesitated.",
    "Alan she said Alan Carstairs.",
    "Did you say youd seen him I\nhave seen him said Bobby slowly.",
    "But not lately.",
    "And he thought\nwith a shock Of course  she doesnt know hes dead...",
    "He said\nRing up Lady Frances.",
    "Then Ill tell you everything.",
    "CHAPTER 19 A Council of Three\n\nMoira returned a few minutes later.",
    "I got her she said.",
    "Ive asked her to come and meet me at a little\nsummerhouse down near the river.",
    "She must have thought it very\nodd but she said shed come.",
    "Good said Bobby.",
    "Now just where\nis this place exactly Moira described it carefully and the way to\nget to it.",
    "Thats all right said Bobby.",
    "You go first.",
    "Ill follow on.",
    "They\nadhered to this programme Bobby lingering to have a word with Mr\nAskew.",
    "Odd thing he said casually that lady Mrs Nicholson I used to\nwork for an uncle of hers.",
    "Canadian gentleman.",
    "Moiras visit to him\nmight he felt give rise to gossip and the last thing he wanted was\nfor gossip of that kind to get about and possibly find its way to Dr\nNicholsons ears.",
    "So thats it is it said Mr Askew.",
    "I rather wondered.",
    "Yes said\nBobby.",
    "She recognized me and came along to hear what I was\ndoing now.",
    "A nice pleasantspoken lady.",
    "Very pleasant indeed.",
    "She cant have much of a life living at the Grange.",
    "It wouldnt be my\nfancy agreed Bobby.",
    "Feeling that he had achieved his object he strolled out into the\nvillage and with an aimless air betook himself in the direction\nindicated by Moira.",
    "He reached the rendezvous successfully and found her there\nwaiting for him.",
    "Frankie had not yet put in an appearance.",
    "Moiras glance was frankly inquiring and Bobby felt he must\nattempt the somewhat difficult task of explanation.",
    "Theres an awful lot Ive got to tell you he said and stopped\nawkwardly.",
    "Yes To begin with said Bobby plunging Im not really a\nchauffeur although I do work in a garage in London.",
    "And my name\nisnt Hawkins  its Jones  Bobby Jones.",
    "I come from Marchbolt in\nWales.",
    "Moira was listening attentively but clearly the mention of\nMarchbolt meant nothing to her.",
    "Bobby set his teeth and went\nbravely to the heart of the matter.",
    "Look here Im afraid Im going to give you rather a shock.",
    "This friend of yours  Alan Carstairs  hes well  youve got to know\n hes dead.",
    "He felt the start she gave and tactfully he averted his\neyes from her face.",
    "Did she mind very much Had she been  dash it\nall  keen on the fellow\n\n\fShe was silent a moment or two then she said in a low thoughtful\nvoice So thats why he never came back I wondered.",
    "Bobby\nventured to steal a look at her.",
    "His spirits rose.",
    "She looked sad and\nthoughtful  but that was all.",
    "Tell me about it she said.",
    "Bobby complied.",
    "He fell over the cliff at Marchbolt  the place where I live.",
    "I and the doctor there happened to be the ones to find him.",
    "He\npaused and then added He had your photograph in his pocket.",
    "Did he She gave a sweet rather sad smile.",
    "Dear Alan he was very faithful.",
    "There was silence for a moment or two and then she\nasked When did this happen About a month ago.",
    "October 3rd to\nbe exact.",
    "That must have been just after he came down here.",
    "Yes.",
    "Did he mention that he was going to Wales She shook her head.",
    "You dont know anyone called Evans do you said Bobby.",
    "Evans Moira frowned trying to think.",
    "No I dont think so.",
    "Its a\nvery common name of course but I cant remember anybody.",
    "What\nis he Thats just what we dont know.",
    "Oh hullo heres Frankie.",
    "Frankie came hurrying along the path.",
    "Her face at the sight of\nBobby and Mrs Nicholson sitting chatting together was a study in\nconflicting expressions.",
    "Hullo Frankie said Bobby.",
    "Im glad youve come.",
    "Weve got to\nhave a great powwow.",
    "To begin with its Mrs Nicholson who is the\noriginal of the photograph.",
    "Oh said Frankie blankly.",
    "She looked at Moira and suddenly laughed.",
    "My dear she said to Bobby now I see why the sight of Mrs\nCayman at the inquest was such a shock to you Exactly said\nBobby.",
    "What a fool he had been.",
    "However could he have imagined for one\nmoment that any space of time could have turned a Moira Nicholson\ninto an Amelia Cayman.",
    "Lord what a fool Ive been he exclaimed.",
    "Moira was looking bewildered.",
    "Theres such an awful lot to tell said Bobby and I dont quite\nknow how to put it all.",
    "He described the Caymans and their\nidentification of the body.",
    "But I dont understand said Moira bewildered.",
    "Whose body was it\nreally her brothers or Alan Carstairs Thats where the dirty work\ncomes in explained Bobby.",
    "And then continued Frankie Bobby was poisoned.",
    "Eight grains\nof morphia said Bobby reminiscently.",
    "Dont start on that said Frankie.",
    "Youre capable of going on for\nhours on the subject and its really very boring to other people.",
    "Let\nme explain.",
    "She took a long breath.",
    "You see she said those Cayman people came to see Bobby after\nthe inquest to ask him if the brother supposed had said anything\nbefore he died and Bobby said No.",
    "But afterwards he\nremembered that he had said something about a man called Evans\nso he wrote and told them so and a few days afterwards he got a\nletter offering him a job in Peru or somewhere and when he\nwouldnt take it the next thing was that someone put a lot of\nmorphia  Eight grains said Bobby.",
    "in his beer.",
    "Only having a most extraordinary inside or\nsomething it didnt kill him.",
    "And so then we saw at once that\nPritchard  or Carstairs you know  must have been pushed over\nthe cliff.",
    "But why asked Moira.",
    "Dont you see Why it seems perfectly clear to us.",
    "I expect I\nhavent told it very well.",
    "Anyway we decided that he had been and\nthat Roger Bassingtonffrench had probably done it.",
    "Roger\nBassingtonffrench\n\nMoira\n\nspoke\n\nin\n\ntones\n\nof\n\nthe\n\nliveliest\n\namusement.",
    "We worked it out that way.",
    "You see he was there at the time and\nyour photograph disappeared and he seemed to be the only man\nwho could have taken it.",
    "I see said Moira thoughtfully.",
    "And then continued Frankie I happened to have an accident just\nhere.",
    "An amazing coincidence wasnt it She looked hard at Bobby\n\n\fwith an admonishing eye.",
    "So I telephoned to Bobby and suggested\nthat he should come down here pretending to be my chauffeur and\nwed look into the matter.",
    "So now you see how it was said Bobby\naccepting Frankies one discreet departure from the truth.",
    "And the\nfinal climax was when last night I strolled into the grounds of the\nGrange and ran right into you  the original of the mysterious\nphotograph.",
    "You recognized me very quickly said Moira with a\nfaint smile.",
    "Yes said Bobby.",
    "I would have recognized the original of that\nphotograph anywhere.",
    "For no particular reason Moira blushed.",
    "Then an idea seemed to strike her and she looked sharply from one\nto the other.",
    "Are you telling me the truth she asked.",
    "Is it really true that you\ncame down here  by accident Or did you come because because  her voice quavered in spite of herself you suspected my\nhusband Bobby and Frankie looked at each other.",
    "Then Bobby\nsaid I give you my word of honour that wed never even heard of\nyour husband till we came down here.",
    "Oh I see.",
    "She turned to\nFrankie.",
    "Im sorry.",
    "Lady Frances but you see I remembered that\nevening when we came to dinner.",
    "Jasper went on and on at you asking you things about your accident.",
    "I couldnt think why.",
    "But I\nthink now that perhaps he suspected it wasnt genuine.",
    "Well if you\nreally want to know it wasnt said Frankie.",
    "Whoof  now I feel better It was all camouflaged very carefully.",
    "But\nit was nothing to do with your husband.",
    "The whole thing was staged\nbecause we wanted to  to  what does one call it  get a line on\n\n\fRoger Bassingtonffrench.",
    "Roger Moira frowned and smiled\nperplexedly.",
    "It seems absurd she said frankly.",
    "All the same facts are facts said Bobby.",
    "Roger  oh no.",
    "She shook her head.",
    "He might be weak or wild.",
    "He\nmight get into debt or get mixed up in a scandal but pushing\nsomeone over a cliff  no I simply cant imagine it.",
    "Do you know\nsaid Frankie I cant very well imagine it either.",
    "But he must have\ntaken that photograph said Bobby stubbornly.",
    "Listen Mrs\nNicholson while I go over the facts.",
    "He did so slowly and carefully.",
    "When he had finished she nodded her head comprehendingly.",
    "I see what you mean.",
    "It seems very queer.",
    "She paused a minute\nand then said unexpectedly Why dont you ask him\n\nCHAPTER 20 Council of Two\n\nFor a moment the bold simplicity of the question quite took their\nbreath away.",
    "Both Frankie and Bobby started to speak at once\nThats impossible  began Bobby just as Frankie said That would\nnever do.",
    "Then they both stopped dead as the possibilities of the\nidea sank in.",
    "You see said Moira eagerly I do see what you mean.",
    "It does seem\nas though Roger must have taken that photograph but I dont\nbelieve for one moment that he pushed Alan over.",
    "Why should he He didnt even know him.",
    "Theyd only met once  at\nlunch down here.",
    "Theyd never come across each other in any way.",
    "Theres no motive.",
    "Then who did push him over asked Frankie\nbluntly.",
    "A shadow crossed Moiras face.",
    "I dont know she said constrainedly.",
    "Look here said Bobby.",
    "Do you mind if I tell Frankie what you told\nme.",
    "About what youre afraid of.",
    "Moira turned her head away.",
    "If you like.",
    "But it sounds so melodramatic and hysterical.",
    "I cant\nbelieve it myself this minute.",
    "And indeed the bald statement made\nunemotionally in the open air of the quiet English countryside did\nseem curiously lacking in reality.",
    "Moira got up abruptly.",
    "I really feel Ive been terribly silly she said her lip trembling.",
    "Please dont pay any attention to what I said Mr Jones.",
    "It was just nerves.",
    "Anyway I must be going now.",
    "Goodbye.",
    "She moved rapidly away.",
    "Bobby sprang up to follow her\nbut Frankie pushed him firmly back.",
    "Stay there idiot leave this to me.",
    "She went rapidly off after Moira.",
    "She returned a few minutes later.",
    "Well queried Bobby anxiously.",
    "Thats all right.",
    "I calmed her down.",
    "It was a bit hard on her having\nher private fears blurted out in front of her to a third person.",
    "I made\nher promise wed have a meeting  all three of us  again soon.",
    "Now\nthat youre not hampered by her being there tell us all about it.",
    "Bobby did so.",
    "Frankie listened attentively.",
    "Then she said It fits in\nwith two things.",
    "First of all I came back just now to find Nicholson\nholding both Sylvia Bassingtonffrenchs hands  and didnt he look\ndaggers at me If looks could kill I feel sure hed have made me a\ncorpse then and there.",
    "Whats the second thing asked Bobby.",
    "Oh just an incident.",
    "Sylvia described how Moiras photograph had\nmade a great impression on some stranger who had come to the\nhouse.",
    "Depend upon it that was Carstairs.",
    "He recognized the\nphotograph Mrs Bassingtonffrench tells him that it is a portrait of\na Mrs Nicholson and that explains how he came to find out where\nshe was.",
    "But you know Bobby I dont see yet where Nicholson\ncomes in.",
    "Why should he want to do away with Alan Carstairs You\nthink it was him and not Bassingtonffrench Rather a coincidence\nif he and Bassingtonffrench should both be in Marchbolt on the\nsame day.",
    "Well coincidences do happen.",
    "But if it was Nicholson I\ndont yet see the motive.",
    "Was Carstairs on the track of Nicholson as\nthe head of a dope gang Or is your new lady friend the motive for\nthe murder It might be both suggested Bobby.",
    "He may know\nthat Carstairs and his wife had an interview and he may have\nbelieved that his wife gave him away somehow.",
    "Now that is a\npossibility said Frankie.",
    "But the first thing is to make sure about\nRoger Bassingtonffrench.",
    "The only thing weve got against him is\nthe photograph business.",
    "If he can clear that up satisfactorily \nYoure going to tackle him on the subject Frankie is that wise If\n\n\fhe is the villain of the piece as we decided he must be it means\nthat were going to show him our hand.",
    "Not quite  not the way I\nshall do it.",
    "After all in every other way hes been perfectly\nstraightforward and above board.",
    "Weve taken that to be supercunning  but suppose it just happens\nto be innocence he can explain the photograph and I shall be\nwatching him when he does explain  and if theres the least sign of\nhesitation of guilt I shall see it  as I say if he can explain the\nphotograph  then he may be a very valuable ally.",
    "How do you\nmean Frankie My dear your little friend may be an emotional\nscaremonger who likes to exaggerate but supposing she isnt  that\nall she says is gospel truth  that her husband wants to get rid of her\nand marry Sylvia.",
    "Dont you realize that in that case Henry\nBassingtonffrench is in mortal danger too.",
    "At all costs weve got to\nprevent him being sent to the Grange.",
    "And at present Roger\nBassingtonffrench is on Nicholsons side.",
    "Good for you Frankie\nsaid Bobby quietly.",
    "Go ahead with your plan.",
    "Frankie got up to go\nbut before departing she paused for a moment.",
    "Isnt it odd she said.",
    "We seem somehow to have got in between\nthe covers of a book.",
    "Were in the middle of someone elses story.",
    "Its a frightfully queer feeling.",
    "I know what you mean said Bobby.",
    "There is something rather uncanny about it.",
    "I should call it a play\nrather than a book.",
    "Its as though wed walked on to the stage in the\nmiddle of the second act and we havent really got parts in the play\nat all but we have to pretend and what makes it so frightfully hard\nis that we havent the faintest idea what the first act was about.",
    "Frankie nodded eagerly.",
    "Im not even so sure its the second act  I think its more like the\nthird.",
    "Bobby Im sure weve got to go back a long way... And weve\ngot to be quick because I fancy the play is frightfully near the final\ncurtain.",
    "With corpses strewn everywhere said Bobby.",
    "And what\nbrought us into the show was a regular cue  five words  quite\nmeaningless as far as we are concerned.",
    "Why didnt they ask\nEvans Isnt it odd Bobby that though weve found out a good\ndeal and more and more characters come into the thing we never\nget any nearer to the mysterious Evans Ive got an idea about\nEvans.",
    "Ive a feeling that Evans doesnt really matter at all  that\nalthough hes been the starting point as it were yet in himself hes\nprobably quite inessential.",
    "It will be like that story of Wells where a prince built a marvellous\npalace or temple round the tomb of his beloved.",
    "And when it was finished there was just one little thing that jarred.",
    "So he said Take it away.",
    "And the thing was actually the tomb\nitself.",
    "Sometimes said Frankie I dont believe there is an Evans.",
    "Saying which she nodded to Bobby and retraced her steps\ntowards the house.",
    "Frankie stared at him.",
    "Suddenly she remembered that in Bobbys\nfirst account of the tragedy he had mentioned putting a\nhandkerchief over the face of the dead man.",
    "You never thought of looking went on Frankie.",
    "No.",
    "Why should I Of course thought Frankie ify found a\nphotograph of somebody I knew in a dead persons pocket I should\n\n\fsimply have had to look at the persons face.",
    "How beautifully\nincurious men are Poor little thing she said.",
    "Im so terribly sorry\nfor her.",
    "Who do you mean  Moira Nicholson Why are you so sorry\nfor her Because shes frightened said Frankie slowly.",
    "She always looks half scared to death.",
    "What is she frightened of\nHer husband.",
    "I dont know that Id care to be up against Jasper\nNicholson myself admitted Roger.",
    "Shes sure hes trying to murder her said Frankie abruptly.",
    "Oh my dear He looked at her incredulously.",
    "Sit down said Frankie.",
    "Im going to tell you a lot of things.",
    "Ive got to prove to you that Dr Nicholson is a dangerous criminal.",
    "A criminal Rogers tone was frankly incredulous.",
    "Wait till youve heard the whole story.",
    "She gave him a clear and\ncareful narrative of all that had occurred since the day Bobby and\nDr Thomas had found the body.",
    "She only kept back the fact that her\naccident had not been genuine but she let it appear that she had\nlingered at Merroway Court through her intense desire to get to the\nbottom of the mystery.",
    "She could complain of no lack of interest on the part of her listener.",
    "Roger seemed quite fascinated by the story.",
    "Is this really true he demanded.",
    "All this about the fellow Jones\nbeing poisoned and all that Absolute gospel truth my dear.",
    "Sorry for my incredulity  but the facts do take a bit of swallowing\ndont they He was silent a minute frowning.",
    "Look here he said at last.",
    "Fantastic as the whole thing sounds I\nthink you must be right in your first deduction.",
    "This man Alex\nPritchard or Alan Carstairs must have been murdered.",
    "If he wasnt\nthere seems no point in the attack upon Jones.",
    "Whether the key\nword to the situation is the phrase Why didnt they ask Evans or\nnot doesnt seem to me to matter much since youve no clue to who\nEvans is or as to what he was to have been asked.",
    "Lets put it that\nthe murderer or murderers assumed that Jones was in possession\nof some knowledge whether he knew it himself or not which was\ndangerous to them.",
    "So accordingly they tried to eliminate him and\nprobably would try again if they got on his track.",
    "So far that seems\nsense  but I dont see by what process of reasoning you fix on\nNicholson as the criminal.",
    "Hes such a sinister man and hes got a\ndarkblue Talbot and he was away from here on the day that Bobby\nwas poisoned.",
    "Thats all pretty thin as evidence.",
    "There are all the\nthings Mrs Nicholson told Bobby.",
    "She recited them and once again\nthey sounded melodramatic and unsubstantial repeated aloud\nagainst the background of the peaceful English landscape.",
    "Roger shrugged his shoulders.",
    "She thinks he supplies Henry with the drug  but thats pure\nconjecture shes not a particle of evidence that he does so.",
    "She thinks he wants to get Henry to the Grange as a patient well\nthats a very natural wish for a doctor to have.",
    "A doctor wants as\nmany patients as he can get.",
    "She thinks hes in love with Sylvia.",
    "Well as to that of course I cant say.",
    "If she thinks so shes\nprobably right interrupted Frankie.",
    "A woman would know all right about her own husband.",
    "Well\ngranting that thats the case it doesnt necessarily mean that the\nmans a dangerous criminal.",
    "Lots of respectable citizens fall in love\nwith other peoples wives.",
    "Theres her belief that he wants to\nmurder her urged Frankie.",
    "Roger looked at her quizzically.",
    "You take that seriously She believes it anyhow.",
    "Roger nodded\nand lit a cigarette.",
    "The question is how much attention to pay that belief of hers he\nsaid.",
    "Its a creepy sort of place the Grange full of queer\ncustomers.",
    "Living there would be inclined to upset a womans\nbalance especially if she were of the timid nervous type.",
    "Then you\ndont think its true I dont say that.",
    "She probably believes quite\nhonestly that he is trying to kill her  but is there any foundation in\nfact for that belief There doesnt seem to be.",
    "Frankie remembered\nwith curious clearness Moira saying Its just nerves.",
    "And\nsomehow the mere fact that she had said that seemed to Frankie to\npoint to the fact that it was not nerves but she found it difficult to\nknow how to explain her point of view to Roger.",
    "Meanwhile the young man was going on Mind you if you could\nshow that Nicholson had been in Marchbolt on the day of the cliff\ntragedy that would be very different or if we could find any definite\nmotive linking him with Carstairs but it seems to me youre ignoring\n\n\fthe real suspects.",
    "What real suspects The  what did you call\nthem  Haymans Caymans.",
    "Thats it.",
    "Now they are undoubtedly\nin it up to the hilt.",
    "First theres the false identification of the body.",
    "Then theres their\ninsistence on the point of whether the poor fellow said anything\nbefore he died.",
    "And I think its logical to assume as you did that\nthe Buenos Aires offer came from or was arranged for by them.",
    "Its a bit annoying said Frankie to have the most strenuous\nefforts made to get you out of the way because you know something\n and not to know yourself what the something you know is.",
    "Bother what a mess one gets into with words.",
    "Yes said Roger grimly\nthat was a mistake on their part.",
    "A mistake that its going to take\nthem all their rime to remedy.",
    "Oh cried Frankie.",
    "Ive just thought\nof something.",
    "Up to now you see Ive been assuming that the\nphotograph of Mrs Cayman was substituted for the one of Moira\nNicholson.",
    "I can assure you said Roger gravely that I have never\ntreasured the likeness of a Mrs Cayman against my heart.",
    "She\nsounds a most repulsive creature.",
    "Well she was handsome in a\nway admitted Frankie.",
    "A sort of bold coarse vampish way.",
    "But\nthe point is this Carstairs must have had her photograph on him as\nwell as Mrs Nicholsons.",
    "Roger nodded.",
    "And you think  he suggested.",
    "I think one was love and the other was business Carstairs was\ncarrying about the Caymans photograph for a reason.",
    "He wanted it\nidentified by somebody perhaps.",
    "Now listen  what happens\nSomeone the male Cayman perhaps is following him and seeing a\ngood opportunity steals up behind him in the mist and gives him a\n\n\fshove.",
    "Carstairs goes over the cliff with a startled cry.",
    "Male\nCayman makes off as fast as he can he doesnt know who may be\nabout.",
    "Well say that he doesnt know that Alan Carstairs is carrying\nabout that photograph.",
    "What happens next The photograph is published  Consternation\nin the Cayman menage said Roger helpfully.",
    "Exactly.",
    "What is to be done The bold thing  grasp the nettle.",
    "Who\nknows Carstairs as Carstairs Hardly anyone in this country.",
    "Down\ngoes Mrs Cayman weeping crocodile tears and recognizing body\nas that of a convenient brother.",
    "They also do a little hocus pocus of\nposting parcels to bolster up the walkingtour theory.",
    "You know\nFrankie.",
    "I think thats positively brilliant said Roger with\nadmiration.",
    "I think its pretty good myself said Frankie.",
    "And youre quite right.",
    "We ought to get busy on the track of the Caymans.",
    "I cant think why we havent done so before.",
    "This was not quite\ntrue since Frankie knew quite well the reason  namely that they\nhad been on the track of Roger himself.",
    "However she felt it would\nbe tactless just at this stage to reveal the fact.",
    "What are we going to do about Mrs Nicholson she asked abruptly.",
    "What do you mean  do about her Well the poor thing is terrified\nto death.",
    "I do think youre callous about her Roger.",
    "Im not really\nbut people who cant help themselves always irritate me.",
    "Oh but\ndo be fair.",
    "What can she do Shes no money and nowhere to go.",
    "Roger said unexpectedly If you were in her place Frankie youd\nfind something to do.",
    "Oh Frankie was rather taken aback.",
    "Yes you would.",
    "If you really thought somebody was trying to\nmurder you you wouldnt just stay there tamely waiting to be\nmurdered.",
    "Youd run away and make a living somehow or youd\nmurder the other person first Youd do something.",
    "Frankie tried to\nthink what she would do.",
    "Id certainly do something she said thoughtfully.",
    "The truth of the matter is that youve got guts and she hasnt said\nRoger with decision.",
    "Frankie felt complimented.",
    "Moira Nicholson was not really the type\nof woman she admired and she had also felt just slightly ruffled by\nBobbys absorption in her.",
    "Bobby she thought to herself likes\nthem helpless.",
    "And she remembered the curious fascination that\nthe photograph had had for him from the start of the affair.",
    "Oh well thought Frankie at any rate Rogers different.",
    "Roger it\nwas clear did not like them helpless.",
    "Moira on the other hand\nclearly did not think very much of Roger.",
    "She had called him weak\nand had scouted the possibility of his having the guts to murder\nanyone.",
    "He was weak perhaps  but undeniably he had charm.",
    "She\nhad felt it from the first moment of arriving at Merroway Court.",
    "Roger said quietly If you liked Frankie you could make anything\nyou chose of a man... Frankie felt a sudden little thrill  and at the\n\n\fsame time an acute embarrassment.",
    "She changed the subject\nhastily.",
    "About your brother she said.",
    "Do you still think he should go to the\nGrange\n\nCHAPTER 22 Another Victim\n\nNo said Roger.",
    "I dont.",
    "After all there are heaps of other places\nwhere he can be treated.",
    "The really important thing is to get Henry\nto agree.",
    "Do you think that will be difficult asked Frankie.",
    "Im afraid it may be.",
    "You heard him the other night.",
    "On the other\nhand if we just catch him in the repentant mood thats very\ndifferent.",
    "Hullo  here comes Sylvia.",
    "Mrs Bassingtonffrench\nemerged from the house and looked about her then seeing Roger\nand Frankie she walked across the grass towards them.",
    "They could see that she was looking terribly worried and strained.",
    "Roger she began Ive been looking for you everywhere.",
    "Then as\nFrankie made a movement to leave them  No my dear dont go.",
    "Of\nwhat use are concealments In any case I think you know all there\nis to know.",
    "Youve suspected this business for some time havent\nyou Frankie nodded.",
    "While Ive been blind  blind  said Sylvia bitterly.",
    "Both of you saw\nwhat I never even suspected.",
    "I only wondered why Henry had\nchanged so to all of us.",
    "It made me very unhappy but I never\n\n\fsuspected the reason.",
    "She paused then went on again with a\nslight change of tone.",
    "As soon as Dr Nicholson had told me the truth I went straight to\nHenry.",
    "Ive only just left him now.",
    "She paused swallowing a sob.",
    "Roger  its going to be all right.",
    "Hes agreed.",
    "He will go to the\nGrange and put himself in Dr Nicholsons hands tomorrow.",
    "Oh no  The exclamation came from Roger and Frankie simultaneously.",
    "Sylvia looked at them  astonished.",
    "Roger spoke awkwardly.",
    "Do you know Sylvia Ive been thinking it over and I dont believe\nthe Grange would be a good plan after all.",
    "You think he can fight it\nby himself asked Sylvia doubtfully.",
    "No I dont.",
    "But there are other places  places not sowell not so\nnear at hand.",
    "Im convinced that staying in this district would be a\nmistake.",
    "Im sure of it said Frankie coming to his rescue.",
    "Oh I dont agree said Sylvia.",
    "I couldnt bear him to go away\nsomewhere.",
    "And\n\nDr\n\nNicholson\n\nhas\n\nbeen\n\nso\n\nkind\n\nand\n\nunderstanding.",
    "I shall feel happy about Henry being under his\ncharge.",
    "I thought you didnt likeNicholson Sylvia said Roger.",
    "Ive changed my mind.",
    "She spoke simply.",
    "Nobody could have been\nnicer or kinder than he was this afternoon.",
    "My silly prejudice\nagainst him has quite vanished.",
    "There was a moments silence.",
    "The\nposition was awkward.",
    "Neither Roger nor Sylvia knew quite what to say next.",
    "Poor Henry said Sylvia.",
    "He broke down.",
    "He was terribly upset at\nmy knowing.",
    "He agreed that he must fight this awful craving for my\nsake and Tommys but he said I hadnt a conception of what it\nmeant.",
    "I suppose I havent though Dr Nicholson explained very\nfully.",
    "It becomes a kind of obsession  people arent responsible for\ntheir actions  so he said.",
    "Oh Roger it seems so awful.",
    "But Dr\nNicholson was really kind.",
    "I trust him.",
    "All the same I think it would\nbe better  began Roger.",
    "Sylvia turned on him.",
    "I dont understand you Roger.",
    "Why have you changed your mind\nHalf an hour ago you were all for Henrys going to the Grange.",
    "Well\n Ive  Ive had time to think the matter over since  Again Sylvia\ninterrupted.",
    "Anyway Ive made up my mind.",
    "Henry shall go to the Grange and\nnowhere else.",
    "They confronted her in silence then Roger said Do\nyou know I think I will ring up Nicholson.",
    "He will be home now.",
    "Id\nlike  just to have a talk with him about matters.",
    "Without waiting for\nher reply he turned away and went rapidly into the house.",
    "The two\nwomen stood looking after him.",
    "I cannot understand Roger said Sylvia impatiently.",
    "About a\nquarter of an hour ago he was positively urging me to arrange for\nHenry to go to the Grange.",
    "Her tone held a distinct note of anger.",
    "All the same said Frankie I agree with him.",
    "Im sure Ive read\nsomewhere that people ought always to go for a cure somewhere\nfar away from their homes.",
    "I think thats just nonsense said\nSylvia.",
    "Frankie felt in a dilemma.",
    "Sylvias unexpected obstinacy was\nmaking things difficult and also she seemed suddenly to have\nbecome as violently proNicholson as she formerly had been\nagainst him.",
    "It was very hard to know what arguments to use.",
    "Frankie considered telling the whole story to Sylvia  but would\nSylvia believe it Even Roger had not been very impressed by the\ntheory of Dr Nicholsons guilt.",
    "Sylvia with her newfound\npartisanship where the doctor was concerned would probably be\neven less so.",
    "She might even go and repeat the whole thing to him.",
    "It was certainly difficult.",
    "An aeroplane passed low overhead in the gathering dusk filling the\nair with its loud beat of engines.",
    "Both Sylvia and Frankie stared up\nat it glad of the respite it afforded since neither of them quite knew\nwhat to say next.",
    "It gave Frankie time to collect her thoughts and\nSylvia time to recover from her fit of sudden anger.",
    "As the aeroplane disappeared over the trees and its roar receded\ninto the distance Sylvia turned abruptly to Frankie.",
    "Its been so awful  she said brokenly.",
    "And you all seem to want to\nsend Henry far away from me.",
    "No no said Frankie.",
    "It wasnt that\nat all.",
    "She cast about for a minute.",
    "It was only that I thought he ought to have the best treatment.",
    "And I\ndo think that Dr Nicholson is rather  well rather a quack.",
    "I dont\nbelieve it said Sylvia.",
    "I think hes a very clever man and just the\nkind of man Henry needs.",
    "She looked defiantly at Frankie.",
    "Frankie\nmarvelled at the hold Dr Nicholson had acquired over her in such a\nshort time.",
    "All her former distrust of the man seemed to have vanished\ncompletely.",
    "At a loss what to say or do next Frankie relapsed into silence.",
    "Presently Roger came out again from the house.",
    "He seemed slightly\nbreathless.",
    "Nicholson isnt in yet he said.",
    "I left a message.",
    "I dont see why\nyou want to see Dr Nicholson so urgently said Sylvia.",
    "You\nsuggested this plan and its all arranged and Henry has\nconsented.",
    "I think Ive got some say in the matter Sylvia said\nRoger gently.",
    "After all Im Henrys brother.",
    "You suggested the\nplan yourself said Sylvia obstinately.",
    "Yes but Ive heard a few things about Nicholson since.",
    "What\nthings Oh I dont believe you.",
    "She bit her lip turned away and\nplunged into the house.",
    "Roger looked at Frankie.",
    "This is a bit awkward he said.",
    "Very awkward indeed.",
    "Once Sylvia has made her mind up she\ncan be obstinate as the devil.",
    "What are we going to do They sat\ndown again on the garden seat and went into the matter carefully.",
    "Roger agreed with Frankie that to tell the whole story to Sylvia\nwould be a mistake.",
    "The best plan in his opinion would be to tackle\nthe doctor.",
    "But what are you going to say exactly I dont know that I shall say\nmuch  but I shall hint a good deal.",
    "At any rate I agree with you\nabout one thing  Henry mustnt go to the Grange.",
    "Even if we come\nright out into the open weve got to stop that.",
    "We give the whole\nshow away if we do Frankie reminded him.",
    "I know.",
    "Thats why weve got to try everything else first.",
    "Curse Sylvia why must she turn obstinate just at this minute It\nshows the power of the man Frankie said.",
    "Yes.",
    "You know it inclines me to believe that evidence or no\nevidence you may be right about him after all  whats that They\nboth sprang up.",
    "It sounded like a shot said Frankie.",
    "From the house.",
    "They looked\nat each other then raced towards the building.",
    "They went in by the trench window of the drawingroom and passed\nthrough into the hall.",
    "Sylvia Bassingtonffrench was standing there\nher face white as paper.",
    "Did you hear she said.",
    "It was a shot  from Henrys study.",
    "She\nswayed and Roger put an arm round her to steady her.",
    "Frankie went to the study door and turned the handle.",
    "Its locked she said.",
    "The window said Roger.",
    "He deposited Sylvia who was in a halffainting condition on a\nconvenient settee and raced out again through the drawingroom\nFrankie on his heels.",
    "They went round the house till they came to\nthe study window.",
    "It was closed but they put their went into his\nstudy locked the door wrote a few words on a sheet of paper  and\n shot himself.",
    "Bobby its too ghastly.",
    "Its  its grim.",
    "I know said\nBobby quietly.",
    "They were both silent for a little.",
    "I shall have to leave today of course said Frankie presently.",
    "Yes I suppose you will.",
    "How is she  Mrs Bassingtonffrench I\nmean Shes collapsed poor soul.",
    "I havent seen her since we  we\nfound the body.",
    "The shock to her must have been awful.",
    "Bobby\nnodded.",
    "Youd better bring the car round about eleven continued Frankie.",
    "Bobby did not answer.",
    "Frankie looked at him impatiently.",
    "Whats the matter with you Bobby You look as though you were\nmiles away.",
    "Sorry.",
    "As a matter of fact  Yes Well I was just\nwondering.",
    "I suppose  well I suppose its all right What do you\nmean  all right I mean its quite certain that he did commit\nsuicide Oh said Frankie.",
    "I see.",
    "She thought a minute.",
    "Yes she\nsaid it was suicide all right.",
    "Youre quite sure You see Frankie\nwe have Moiras word for it that Nicholson wanted two people out of\nthe way.",
    "Well heres one of them gone.",
    "Frankie thought again but\nonce more she shook her head.",
    "It must be suicide she said.",
    "I was in the garden with Roger when\nwe heard the shot.",
    "We both ran straight in through the drawingroom to the hall.",
    "The study door was locked on the inside.",
    "We went\nround to the window.",
    "That was fastened also and Roger had to\nsmash it.",
    "It wasnt till then that Nicholson appeared upon the\nscene.",
    "Bobby reflected upon this information.",
    "It looks all right he agreed.",
    "But Nicholson seems to have\nappeared on the scene very suddenly.",
    "Hed left a stick behind\nearlier in the afternoon and had come back for it.",
    "Bobby was\nfrowning with the process of thought.",
    "Listen Frankie.",
    "Suppose that actually Nicholson shot Bassingtonffrench  Having induced him first to write a suicides letter of\nfarewell I should think that would be the easiest thing in the world\nto fake.",
    "Any alteration in handwriting would be put down to\nagitation.",
    "Yes thats true.",
    "Go on with your theory.",
    "Nicholson\nshoots Bassingtonffrench leaves the farewell letter and nips out\nlocking the door  to appear again a few minutes later as though he\nhad just arrived.",
    "Frankie shook her head regretfully.",
    "Its a good idea  but it wont work.",
    "To begin with the key was in\nHenry Bassingtonffrenchs pocket  Who found it there Well as a\nmatter of fact Nicholson did.",
    "There you are.",
    "Whats easier for him\nthan to pretend to find it there.",
    "I was watching him  remember.",
    "Im\nsure the key was in the pocket.",
    "Thats what one says when one\nwatches a conjurer.",
    "You see the rabbit being put into the hat If\nNicholson is a highclass criminal a simple little bit of sleight of\nhand like that would be childs play to him.",
    "Well you may be right\nabout that but honestly Bobby the whole things impossible.",
    "Sylvia Bassingtonffrench was actually in the house when the shot\nwas fired.",
    "The moment she heard it she ran out into the hall.",
    "If\nNicholson had fired the shot and come out through the study door\nshe would have been bound to see him.",
    "Besides she told us that he\nactually came up the drive to the front door.",
    "She saw him coming as\nwe ran round the house and went to meet him and brought him\nround to the study window.",
    "No Bobby I hate to say it but the man\nhas an alibi.",
    "On principle I distrust people who have alibis said\nBobby.",
    "So do I.",
    "But I dont see how you can get round this one.",
    "No.",
    "Sylvia\nBassingtonffrenchs word ought to be good enough.",
    "Yes indeed.",
    "Well said Bobby with a sigh.",
    "I suppose well have to leave it at\nsuicide.",
    "Poor devil.",
    "Whats the next angle of attack Frankie The\nCaymans said Frankie.",
    "I cant think how weve been so remiss as\nnot to have looked them up before.",
    "Youve kept the address\nCayman wrote from havent you Yes.",

    "Go on.",
    "Lady Macbeth.",
    "You\nknow Ive always thought said Frankie suddenly digressing wildly\nfrom the matter in hand that Lady Macbeth incited Macbeth to do\nall those murders simply and solely because she was so frightfully\nbored with life  and incidentally with Macbeth.",
    "Im sure he was one\nof those meek inoffensive men who drive their wives distracted\nwith boredom.",
    "But having once committed a murder for the first\ntime in his life he felt the hell of a fine fellow and began to develop\nego mania as a compensation for his former inferiority complex.",

    "I dont wonder Moira gets the\nhorrors here.",
    "They drove up to the front door and Bobby got down\nand rang the bell.",
    "It was not answered for some minutes.",
    "Finally a\nwoman in nurses kit opened it.",
    "Mrs Nicholson said Bobby.",
    "The woman hesitated then withdrew into the hall and opened the\ndoor wider.",
    "Frankie jumped out of the car and passed into the\nhouse.",
    "The door closed behind her.",
    "It had a nasty echoing clang as\n\n\fit shut.",
    "Frankie noticed that it had heavy bolts and bars across it.",
    "Quite irrationally she felt afraid  as though she was here in this\nsinister house a prisoner.",
    "Nonsense she told herself.",
    "Bobbys outside in the car.",

    "Yes he repeated.",

    "If she isnt up yet said\nFrankie smiling pleasantly Ill sit down and wait.",
    "Oh shes up\nsaid Dr Nicholson.",
    "Good said Frankie.",
    "I want to persuade her to come to me for a\nvisit.",
    "Shes practically promised to.",
    "She smiled again.",
    "Why now thats really very kind of you.",
    "Lady Frances very kind\nindeed.",
    "Im sure Moira would have enjoyed that very much.",
    "Would\nhave asked Frankie sharply.",
    "Dr Nicholson smiled showing his fine set of even white teeth.",
    "Unfortunately my wife went away this morning.",
    "Went away said\nFrankie blankly.",
    "Where Oh just for a little change.",
    "You know\nwhat women are Lady Frances.",
    "This is rather a gloomy place for a\nyoung woman.",
    "Occasionally Moira feels she must have a little\nexcitement and then off she goes.",
    "You dont know where she has\ngone said Frankie.",
    "London I imagine.",
    "Shops and theatres.",
    "You know the sort of thing.",
    "Frankie felt that his smile was the most disagreeable thing she had\never come across.",
    "I am going up to London today she said lightly.",
    "Will you give me\nher address She usually stays at the Savoy said Dr Nicholson.",
    "But in any case I shall probably hear from her in a day or so.",
    "Shes\nnot a very good correspondent Im afraid and I believe in perfect\nliberty between husband and wife.",
    "But I think the Savoy is the most\n\n\flikely place for you to find her.",
    "He held the door open and Frankie\nfound herself shaking hands with him and being ushered to the\nfront door.",
    "The nurse was standing there to let her out.",
    "The last\nthing Frankie heard was Dr Nicholsons voice suave and perhaps\njust a trifle ironical.",
    "So very kind of you to think of asking my wife to stay.",
    "Lady\nFrances.",
    "CHAPTER 24 On the Track of the Caymans\n\nBobby had some ado to preserve his impassive chauffeurs\ndemeanour as Frankie came out alone.",
    "She said Back to Staverley Hawkins for the benefit of the nurse.",
    "The car swept down the drive and out through the gates.",
    "Then when they came to an empty bit of road Bobby pulled up and\nlooked inquiringly at his companion.",
    "What about it he asked.",
    "Rather pale Frankie replied Bobby I dont like it.",
    "Apparently\nshes gone away.",
    "Gone away This morning Or last night.",
    "Without a word to us Bobby I just dont believe it.",
    "The man was\nlying  Im sure of it.",
    "Bobby had gone very pale.",
    "He murmured Too\nlate Idiots that weve been We should never have let her go back\nthere yesterday.",
    "You dont think shes  dead do you whispered\nFrankie in a shaky voice.",
    "No said Bobby in a violent voice as though to reassure himself.",
    "They were both silent for a minute or two then Bobby stated his\ndeductions in a calmer tone.",
    "She must be still alive because of the disposing of the body and all\nthat.",
    "Her death would have to seem natural and accidental.",
    "No\nshes either been spirited away somewhere against her will or else\n and this is what I believe  shes still there.",
    "At the Grange At the\nGrange.",
    "Well said Frankie what are we going to do Bobby\nthought for a minute.",
    "I dont think you can do anything he said at last.",
    "Youd better go\nback to London.",
    "You suggested trying to trace the Caymans.",
    "Go on\nwith that.",
    "Oh Bobby My dear you cant be of any use down here.",
    "Youre known  very well known by now.",
    "Youve announced that\nyoure going  what can you do You cant stay on at Merroway.",
    "You\ncant come and stay at the Anglers Arms.",
    "Youd set every tongue in\nthe neighbourhood wagging.",
    "No you must go.",
    "Nicholson may suspect but he cant be sure that you know\nanything.",
    "You go back to town and Ill stay.",
    "At the Anglers Arms\nup my headquarters at Ambledever  thats ten miles away and if\nMoiras still in that beastly house I shall find her.",
    "Frankie demurred\na little.",
    "Bobby you will be careful I shall be cunning as the serpent.",
    "With\na rather heavy heart Frankie gave in.",
    "What Bobby said was\ncertainly sensible enough.",
    "She herself could do no further good\n\n\fdown here.",
    "Bobby drove her up to town and Frankie letting herself\ninto the Brook Street house felt suddenly forlorn.",
    "She was not one however to let the grass grow under her feet.",
    "At\nthree oclock that afternoon a fashionably but soberly dressed\nyoung woman with pincenez and an earnest frown might have\nbeen seen approaching St Leonards Gardens a sheaf of\npamphlets and papers in her hand.",
    "St Leonards Gardens Paddington was a distinctly gloomy\ncollection of houses most of them in a somewhat dilapidated\ncondition.",
    "The place had a general air of having seen better days a\nlong time ago.",
    "Frankie walked along looking up at the numbers.",
    "Suddenly she\ncame to a halt with a grimace of vexation.",
    "No.",
    "17 had a board up announcing that it was to be sold or let\nunfurnished.",
    "Frankie immediately removed the pincenez and the earnest air.",
    "It seemed that the political canvasser would not be required.",
    "The names of several house agents were given.",
    "Frankie selected\ntwo and wrote them down.",
    "Then having determined on her plan of\ncampaign she proceeded to put it into action.",
    "The first agents were Messrs. Gordon  Porter of Praed Street.",
    "Good morning said Frankie.",
    "I wonder if you can give me the\naddress of a Mr Cayman He was until recently at 17 St Leonards\nGardens.",
    "Thats right said the young man to whom Frankie had\naddressed herself.",
    "Only there a short time though wasnt he\n\nWe act for the owners you see.",
    "Mr Cayman took it on a quarterly\ntenancy as he might have to take up a post abroad any moment.",
    "I\nbelieve hes actually done so.",
    "Then you havent got his address\nIm afraid not.",
    "He settled up with us and that was all.",
    "But he must\nhave had some address originally when he took the house.",
    "A hotel\n I think it was the G.W.R.",
    "Paddington Station you know.",
    "References suggested Frankie.",
    "He paid the quarters rent in advance and a deposit to cover the\nelectric light and gas.",
    "Oh said Frankie feeling despairing.",
    "She saw the young man looking rather curiously at her.",
    "House agents are adepts at summing up the class of clients.",
    "He obviously found Frankies interest in the Caymans rather\nunexpected.",
    "He owes me a good deal of money said Frankie mendaciously.",
    "The young mans face immediately assumed a shocked expression.",
    "Thoroughly sympathetic with beauty in distress he hunted up files\nof correspondence and did all he could but no trace of Mr\nCaymans present or late abode could be found.",
    "Frankie thanked him and departed.",
    "She took a taxi to the next firm\nof house agents.",
    "She wasted no time in repeating the process.",
    "The\nfirst agents were the ones who had let Cayman the house.",
    "These\npeople would be merely concerned to let it again on behalf of the\nowner.",
    "Frankie asked for an order to view.",
    "This time to counteract the expression of surprise that she saw\nappear on the clerks face she explained that she wanted a cheap\nproperty to open as a hostel for girls.",
    "The surprised expression\ndisappeared and Frankie emerged with the key of 17 Leonards\nGardens the keys of two more properties which she had no wish\nto see and an order to view yet a fourth.",
    "It was a bit of luck Frankie thought that the clerk had not wished to\naccompany her but perhaps they only did that when it was a\nquestion of a furnished tenancy.",
    "The musty smell of a closedup house assailed Frankies nostrils as\nshe unlocked and pushed open the front door of No.",
    "17.",
    "It was an unappetising house cheaply decorated and with\nblistered dirty paint.",
    "Frankie went over it methodically from garret\nto basement.",
    "The house had not been cleaned up on departure.",
    "There were bits of string old newspapers and some odd nails and\ntools.",
    "But of personal matter Frankie could not find so much as the\nscrap of a tomup letter.",
    "The only thing that struck her as having a possible significance was\nan ABC railway guide which lay open on one of the window seats.",
    "There was nothing to indicate that any of the names of the open\npage were of special significance but Frankie copied the lot down\nin a little notebook as a poor substitute for all she had hoped to\nfind.",
    "As far as tracing the Caymans was concerned she had drawn a\nblank.",
    "She consoled herself with the reflection that this was only to be\nexpected.",
    "If Mr and Mrs Cayman were associated with the wrong\nside of the law they would take particularly good care that no one\nshould be able to trace them.",
    "It was at least a kind of negative\nconfirmatory evidence.",
    "Still Frankie felt definitely disappointed as she handed back the\nkeys to the house agents and uttered mendacious statements as to\ncommunicating with them in a few days.",
    "She walked down towards the Park feeling rather depressed and\nwondered what on earth she was going to do next.",
    "These fruitless\nmeditations were interrupted by a sharp and violent squall of rain.",
    "No taxi was in sight and Frankie hurriedly preserved a favourite hat\nby hurrying into the tube which was close at hand.",
    "She took a ticket\nto Piccadilly Circus and bought a couple of papers at the bookstall.",
    "When she had entered the train  almost empty at this time of day she resolutely banished thoughts of the vexing problem and\nopening her paper strove to concentrate her attention on its\ncontents.",
    "She read desultory snippets here and there.",
    "Number of road deaths.",
    "Mysterious disappearance of a schoolgirl.",
    "Lady Peterhamptons party at Claridges.",
    "Sir John Milkingtons\nconvalescence after his accident yachting  the Astradora  the\nfamous yacht which had belonged to the late Mr John Savage the\nmillionaire.",
    "Was she an unlucky boat\n\nThe man who had designed her had met with a tragic death Mr\nSavage had committed suicide  Sir John Milkington had just\nescaped death by a miracle.",
    "Frankie lowered the paper frowning in an effort of remembrance.",
    "Twice before the name of Mr John Savage had been mentioned once by Sylvia Bassingtonffrench when she was speaking of Alan\nCarstairs and once by Bobby when he was repeating the\nconversation he had had with Mrs Rivington.",
    "Alan Carstairs had been a friend of John Savages.",
    "Mrs Rivington\nhad had a vague idea that Carstairs presence in England had\nsomething to do with the death of Savage.",
    "Savage had  what was\nit  he had committed suicide because he thought he had cancer.",
    "Supposing  supposing Alan Carstairs had not been satisfied with\nthe account of his friends death.",
    "Supposing he had come over to\ninquire into the whole thing Supposing that here in the\ncircumstances surrounding Savages death  was the first act of the\ndrama that she and Bobby were acting in.",
    "Its possible thought Frankie.",
    "Yes its possible.",
    "She thought\ndeeply wondering how best to attack this new phase of the matter.",
    "She had no idea as to who had been John Savages friends or\nintimates.",
    "Then an idea struck her  his will.",
    "If there had been something\nsuspicious about the way he met his death his will would give a\npossible clue.",
    "Somewhere in London Frankie knew was a place where you went\nand read wills if you paid a shilling.",
    "But she couldnt remember\nwhere it was.",
    "The train drew up at a station and Frankie saw that it was the\nBritish Museum.",
    "She had overshot Oxford Circus where she meant\nto have changed by two stations.",
    "She jumped up and left the train.",
    "As she emerged into the street an\nidea came to her.",
    "Five minutes walk brought her to the office of\nMessrs. Spragge Spragge Jenkinson  Spragge.",
    "Frankie was received with deference and was at once ushered into\nthe private fastness of Mr Spragge the senior member of the firm.",
    "Mr Spragge was exceedingly genial.",
    "He had a rich mellow\npersuasive voice which his aristocratic clients had found extremely\nsoothing when they had come to him to be extricated from some\nmess.",
    "It was rumoured that Mr Spragge knew more discreditable\nsecrets about noble families than any other man in London.",
    "This is a pleasure indeed.",
    "Lady Frances said Mr Spragge.",
    "Do sit down.",
    "Now are you sure that chair is quite comfortable\n\nYes yes.",
    "The weather is very delightful just now is it not A St\nMartins summer.",
    "And how is Lord Marchington Well I trust\nFrankie answered these and other inquiries in a suitable manner.",
    "Then Mr Spragge removed his pincenez from his nose and became\nmore definitely the legal guide and adviser.",
    "And now.",
    "Lady Frances he said.",
    "What is it gives me the pleasure\nof seeing you in my  hm  dingy office this afternoon Blackmail\nsaid his eyebrows.",
    "Indiscreet letters An entanglement with an\nundesirable young man Sued by your dressmaker But the\neyebrows asked these questions in a very discreet manner as\nbefitted a solicitor of Mr Spragges experience and income.",
    "I want to look at a will said Frankie.",
    "And I dont know where you\ngo and what you do.",
    "But there is somewhere you can pay a shilling\nisnt there Somerset House said Mr Spragge.",
    "But what will is it\nI think I can possibly tell you anything you want to know about  er wills in your family.",
    "I may say that I believe our firm has had the\nhonour of drawing them up for many years past.",
    "It isnt a family\nwill said Frankie.",
    "No said Mr Spragge.",
    "And so strong was his almost hypnotic power of drawing\nconfidences out of his clients that Frankie who had not meant to do\nso succumbed to the manner and told him.",
    "I wanted to see the will of Mr Savage  John Savage.",
    "Indeed A\nvery real astonishment showed in Mr Spragges voice.",
    "He had not\nexpected this.",
    "Now that is very extraordinary  very extraordinary\nindeed.",
    "There was something so unusual in his voice that Frankie\nlooked at him in surprise.",
    "Really said Mr Spragge.",
    "Really I do not know what to do.",
    "Perhaps Lady Frances you can give me your reasons for wanting\nto see that will No said Frankie slowly.",
    "Im afraid I cant.",
    "It\nstruck her that Mr Spragge was for some reason behaving quite\nunlike his usual benign omniscient self.",
    "He looked actually worried.",
    "I really believe said Mr Spragge that I ought to warn you.",
    "Warn\nme said Frankie.",
    "Yes.",
    "The indications are vague very vague  but clearly there is\nsomething afoot.",
    "I would not for the world have you involved in any\nquestionable business.",
    "As far as that went Frankie could have told\nhim that she was already involved up to the neck in a business of\nwhich he would have decidedly disapproved.",
    "But she merely stared\nat him inquiringly.",
    "The whole thing is rather an extraordinary coincidence Mr\nSpragge was going on.",
    "Something is clearly afoot  clearly.",

    "I have been\nimpersonated.",
    "Lady Frances.",
    "Deliberately impersonated.",
    "What do you say to that But for just one panicstricken minute\nFrankie could say nothing at all.",
    "CHAPTER 25 Mr Spragge Talks\n\nAt last she stammered How did you find out It was not at all what\nshe meant to say.",
    "She could in fact have bitten out her tongue for\nstupidity a moment later but the words had been said and Mr\nSpragge would have been no lawyer had he failed to perceive that\nthey contained an admission.",
    "So you know something of this business.",
    "Lady Frances Yes said\nFrankie.",
    "She paused drew a deep breath and said The whole thing is really\nmy doing Mr Spragge.",
    "I am amazed said Mr Spragge.",
    "There was a struggle in his voice the outraged lawyer was at war\nwith the fatherly family solicitor.",
    "How did this come about he asked.",
    "It was just a joke said Frankie weakly.",
    "We  we wanted something\nto do.",
    "And who demanded Mr Spragge had the idea of passing\nhimself off as Me Frankie looked at him her wits working once\nmore made a rapid decision.",
    "It was the young Duke of No  She broke off.",

    "CHAPTER 25 Mr Spragge Talks\n\nAt last she stammered How did you find out It was not at all what\nshe meant to say.",
    "She could in fact have bitten out her tongue for\nstupidity a moment later but the words had been said and Mr\nSpragge would have been no lawyer had he failed to perceive that\nthey contained an admission.",
    "So you know something of this business.",
    "Lady Frances Yes said\nFrankie.",
    "She paused drew a deep breath and said The whole thing is really\nmy doing Mr Spragge.",
    "I am amazed said Mr Spragge.",
    "There was a struggle in his voice the outraged lawyer was at war\nwith the fatherly family solicitor.",
    "How did this come about he asked.",
    "It was just a joke said Frankie weakly.",
    "We  we wanted something\nto do.",
    "And who demanded Mr Spragge had the idea of passing\nhimself off as Me Frankie looked at him her wits working once\nmore made a rapid decision.",
    "It was the young Duke of No  She broke off.",
    "I really mustnt\nmention names.",
    "It isnt fair.",
    "But she knew that the tide had turned\nin her favour.",
    "It was doubtful if Mr Spragge could have forgiven a\nmere vicars son such audacity but his weakness for noble names\nled him to look softly on the impertinences of a duke.",
    "His benign\nmanner returned.",
    "Oh you Bright Young People  You Bright Young People he\nmurmured wagging a forefinger.",
    "What trouble you land yourselves\nin.",
    "You would be surprised.",
    "Lady Frances at the amount of legal\ncomplication that may ensue from an apparently harmless practical\njoke determined upon on the spur of the moment.",
    "Just high spirits but sometimes extremely difficult to settle out of court.",
    "I think\n\n\fyoure too marvellous Mr Spragge said Frankie earnestly.",
    "I do\nreally.",
    "Not one person in a thousand would have taken it as you\nhave done.",
    "I feel really terribly ashamed.",
    "No no.",
    "Lady Frances\nsaid Mr Spragge paternally.",
    "Oh but I do.",
    "I suppose it was the Rivington woman  what exactly\ndid she tell you I think I have the letter here.",
    "I opened it only half\nan hour ago.",
    "Frankie held out a hand and Mr Spragge put the letter\ninto it with the air of one saying There see for yourself what your\nfoolishness has led you into.",
    "Dear Mr Spragge Mrs Rivington had\nwritten.",
    "Its really too stupid of me but Ive just remembered\nsomething that might have helped you the day you called on me.",
    "Alan Car stairs mentioned that he was going to a place called\nChipping Somerton.",
    "I dont know whether this will be any help to\nyou.",
    "I was so interested in what you told me about the Maltravers case.",
    "With kind regards Yours sincerely Edith Rivington.",
    "You can see that the matter might have been very grave said Mr\nSpragge severely but with a severity tempered by benevolence.",
    "I\ntook it that some extremely questionable business was afoot.",
    "Whether connected with the Maltravers case or with my client Mr\nCarstairs  Frankie interrupted him.",
    "Was Alan Carstairs a client of yours she inquired excitedly.",
    "He was.",
    "He consulted me when he was last in England a month\nago.",
    "You know Mr Carstairs Lady Frances I think I may say I do\nsaid Frankie.",
    "A most attractive personality said Mr Spragge.",
    "He brought quite\na breath of the  er  wide open spaces into my office.",
    "He came to\nconsult you about Mr Savages will didnt he said Frankie.",
    "Ah said Mr Spragge.",
    "So it was you who advised him to come to\nme He couldnt remember just who it was.",
    "Im sorry I couldnt do\nmore for him.",
    "Just what did you advise him to do asked Frankie.",
    "Or would it be unprofessional to tell me Not in this case said Mr\nSpragge smiling.",
    "My opinion was that there was nothing to be done\n nothing that is unless Mr Savages relatives were prepared to\nspend a lot of money on fighting the case  which I gather they were\nnot prepared or indeed in a position to do.",
    "I never advise bringing\na case into court unless there is every hope of success.",
    "The law.",
    "Lady Frances is an uncertain animal.",
    "It has twists and turns that\nsurprise the nonlegal mind.",
    "Settle out of court has always been my\nmotto.",
    "The\n\nwhole\n\nthing\n\nwas\n\nvery\n\ncurious\n\nsaid\n\nFrankie\n\nthoughtfully.",
    "She had a little of the sensation of walking barefoot over a floor\ncovered with tin tacks.",
    "At any minute she might step on one  and\nthe game would be up.",
    "Such cases are less uncommon than you might think said Mr\nSpragge.",
    "Cases of suicide inquired Frankie.",
    "No no I meant cases of undue influence.",
    "Mr Savage was a hardheaded business man and yet he was clearly as wax in this\n\n\fwomans hands.",
    "Ive no doubt she knew her business thoroughly.",
    "I\nwish youd tell me the whole story properly said Frankie boldly.",
    "Mr\nCarstairs was  well was so heated that I never seemed to get the\nthing clearly.",
    "The case was extremely simple said Mr Spragge.",
    "I\ncan run over the facts to you  they are accessible to everyone  so\nthere is no objection to my doing so.",
    "Then tell me all about it said\nFrankie.",
    "Mr Savage happened to be travelling back from the United States\nto England in November of last year.",
    "He was as you know an\nextremely wealthy man with no near relations.",
    "On this voyage he\nmade the acquaintance of a certain lady  a  er  Mrs Templeton.",
    "Nothing much is known about Mrs Templeton except that she was a\nvery goodlooking woman and had a husband somewhere\nconveniently in the background.",
    "The Caymans thought Frankie.",
    "These ocean trips are dangerous went on Mr Spragge smiling\nand shaking his head.",
    "Mr Savage was clearly very much attracted.",
    "He accepted the ladys invitation to come down and stay at her little\ncottage at Chipping Somerton.",
    "Exactly how often he went there I have not been able to ascertain\nbut there is no doubt that he came more and more under this Mrs\nTempletons influence.",
    "Then came the tragedy.",
    "Mr Savage had for some time been uneasy\nabout his state of health.",
    "He feared that he might be suffering from\na certain disease  Cancer said Frankie.",
    "Well yes as a matter of fact cancer.",
    "The subject became quite an\nobsession with him.",
    "He was staying with the Templetons at the\ntime.",
    "They persuaded him to go up to London and consult a\nspecialist.",
    "He did so.",
    "Now here.",
    "Lady Frances I preserve an open\nmind.",
    "That specialist  a very distinguished man who has been at\nthe top of his profession for many years  swore at the inquest that\nMr Savage was not suffering from cancer and that he had told him\nso but that Mr Savage was so obsessed by his own belief that he\ncould not accept the truth when he was told it.",
    "Now strictly without\nprejudice.",
    "Lady Frances and knowing the medical profession I\nthink things may have gone a little differently.",
    "If Mr Savages symptoms puzzled the doctor he may have spoken\nseriously pulled a long face spoken of certain expensive\ntreatments and while reassuring him as to cancer yet have\nconveyed the impression that something was seriously wrong.",
    "Mr Savage having heard that doctors usually conceal from a\npatient the fact that he is suffering from that disease would\ninterpret this according to his own lights.",
    "The doctors reassuring\nwords were not true  he had got the disease he thought he had.",
    "Anyway Mr Savage came back to Chipping Somerton in a state of\ngreat mental distress.",
    "He saw ahead of him a painful and lingering\ndeath.",
    "I understand some members of his family had died of cancer\nand he determined not to go through what he had seen them suffer.",
    "He sent for a solicitor  a very reputable member of an eminently\nrespectable firm  and the latter drew up a will there and then which\nMr Savage signed and which he then delivered over to the solicitor\nfor safe keeping.",
    "On that same evening Mr Savage took a large\n\n\foverdose of chloral leaving a letter behind in which he explained\nthat he preferred a quick and painless death to a long and painful\none.",
    "By his will Mr Savage left the sum of seven hundred thousand\npounds free of legacy duty to Mrs Templeton and the remainder to\ncertain specified charities.",
    "Mr Spragge leaned back in his chair.",
    "He\nwas now enjoying himself.",
    "The jury brought in the usual sympathetic verdict of Suicide while\nof Unsound Mind but I do not think that we can argue from that that\nhe was necessarily of unsound mind when he made the will.",
    "I do not\nthink that any jury would take it so.",
    "The will was made in the presence of a solicitor in whose opinion\nthe deceased was undoubtedly sane and in possession of his\nsenses.",
    "Nor do I think we can prove undue influence.",
    "Mr Savage did\nnot disinherit anyone near and dear to him  his only relatives were\ndistant cousins whom he seldom saw.",
    "They actually lived in\nAustralia I believe.",
    "Mr Spragge paused.",
    "Mr Carstairs contention was that such a will was completely\nuncharacteristic of Mr Savage.",
    "Mr Savage had no liking for\norganized charities and had always held very strong opinions as to\nmoney passing by blood relationship.",
    "However Mr Carstairs had no\ndocumentary proof of these assertions and as I pointed out to him\nmen change their opinions.",
    "In contesting such a will there would\nbe the charitable organizations to deal with as well as Mrs\nTempleton.",
    "Also the will had been admitted to probate.",
    "There was\nno fuss made at the time asked Frankie.",
    "As I say Mr Savages relatives were not living in this country and\nthey knew very little about the matter.",
    "It was Mr Carstairs who took\nthe matter up.",
    "He returned from a trip into the interior of Africa\ngradually leamt the details of this business and came over to this\ncountry to see if something could be done about it.",
    "I was forced to\ntell him that in my view there was nothing to be done.",
    "Possession is\nnine points of the law and Mrs Templeton was in possession.",
    "Moreover she had left the country and gone I believe to the South\nof France to live.",
    "She refused to enter into any communication on\nthe matter.",
    "I suggested getting counsels opinion but Mr Carstairs\ndecided that it was not necessary and took my view that there was\nnothing to be done  or alternatively that whatever might have\nbeen done at the time and in my opinion that was exceedingly\ndoubtful it was now too late to do it.",
    "I see said Frankie.",
    "And\nnobody knows anything about this Mrs Templeton Mr Spragge\nshook his head and pursed his lips.",
    "A man like Mr Savage with his knowledge of life ought to have\nbeen less easily taken in  but  Mr Spragge shook his head sadly as\na vision of innumerable clients who ought to have known better and\nwho had come to him to have their cases settled out of court\npassed across his mind.",
    "Frankie rose.",
    "Then are extraordinary creatures she said.",
    "She held out a hand.",
    "Goodbye Mr Spragge she said.",
    "Youve been wonderful simply\nwonderful.",
    "I feel too ashamed.",
    "You Bright Young People must be\nmore careful said Mr Spragge shaking his head at her.",
    "Youve been an angel said Frankie.",
    "She squeezed his hand fervently and departed.",
    "Mr Spragge sat down again before his table.",
    "He was thinking.",
    "The young Duke of  There were only two dukes who could be so\ndescribed.",
    "Which was it\n\nHe picked up a Peerage.",
    "CHAPTER 26 Nocturnal Adventure\n\nThe inexplicable absence of Moira worried Bobby more than he\ncared to admit.",
    "He told himself repeatedly that it was absurd to\njump to conclusions  that it was fantastic to imagine that Moira had\nbeen done away with in a house full of possible witnesses  that\nthere was probably some perfectly simple explanation and that at\nthe worst she could only be a prisoner in the Grange.",
    "That she had left Staverley of her own free will Bobby did not for\none minute believe.",
    "He was convinced that she would never have\n\n\fgone off like that without sending him a word of explanation.",
    "Besides she had stated emphatically that she had nowhere to go.",
    "No the sinister Dr Nicholson was at the bottom of this.",
    "Somehow or other he must have become aware of Moiras activities and this was his counter move.",
    "Somewhere within the\nsinister walls of the Grange Moira was a prisoner unable to\ncommunicate with the outside world.",
    "But she might not remain a prisoner long.",
    "Bobby believed implicitly\nevery word Moira had uttered.",
    "Her fears were neither the result of a\nvivid imagination not yet of nerves.",
    "They were simple stark truth.",
    "Nicholson meant to get rid of his wife.",
    "Several times his plans had\nmiscarried.",
    "Now by communicating her fears to others she had\nforced his hand.",
    "He must act quickly or not at all.",
    "Would he have the\nnerve to act\n\nBobby believed he would.",
    "He must know that even if these\nstrangers had listened to his wifes fears they had no evidence.",
    "Also he would believe that he had only Frankie to deal with.",
    "It was\npossible that he had suspected her from the first  his pertinent\nquestioning as to her accident seemed to point to that  but as\nLady Frances chauffeur Bobby did not believe that he himself was\nsuspected of being anything other than he appeared to be.",
    "Yes Nicholson would act.",
    "Moiras body would probably be found in\nsome district far from Staverley.",
    "It might perhaps be washed up\nby the sea.",
    "Or it might be found at the foot of a cliff.",
    "The thing would appear to be Bobby was almost sure an\naccident.",
    "Nicholson specialized in accidents.",
    "Nevertheless Bobby believed that the planning and carrying out of\nsuch an accident would need time  not much time but a certain\namount.",
    "Nicholsons hand was being forced  he had to act quicker\nthan he had anticipated.",
    "It seemed reasonable to suppose that\ntwentyfour hours at least must elapse before he could put any plan\ninto operation.",
    "Before that interval had elapsed Bobby meant to have found Moira\nif she were in the Grange.",
    "After he had left Frankie in Brook Street he started to put his plans\ninto operation.",
    "He judged it wise to give the Mews a wide berth.",
    "For\nall he knew a watch might be being kept on it.",
    "As Hawkins he believed himself to be still unsuspected.",
    "Now\nHawkins in turn was about to disappear.",
    "That evening a young man with a moustache dressed in a cheap\ndarkblue suit arrived at the bustling little town of Ambledever.",
    "The\nyoung man put up at an hotel near the station registering as\nGeorge Parker.",
    "Having deposited his suitcase there he strolled out\nand entered into negotiations for hiring a motorcycle.",
    "At ten oclock that evening a motorcyclist in cap and goggles\npassed through the village of Staverley and came to a halt at a\ndeserted part of the road not far from the Grange.",
    "Hastily shoving the bicycle behind some convenient bushes Bobby\nlooked up and down the road.",
    "It was quite deserted.",
    "Then he sauntered along the wall till he came to the little door.",
    "As\nbefore it was unlocked.",
    "With another look up and down the road to\nmake sure he was not observed Bobby slipped quietly inside.",
    "He\nput his hand into the pocket of his coat where a bulge showed the\npresence of his service revolver.",
    "The feel of it was reassuring.",
    "Inside the grounds of the Grange everything seemed quiet.",
    "Bobby grinned to himself as he recalled bloodcurdling stories\nwhere the villain of the piece kept a cheetah or some excited beast\nof prey about the place to deal with intruders.",
    "Dr Nicholson seemed content with mere bolts and bars and even\nthere he seemed to be somewhat remiss.",
    "Bobby felt certain that\nthat little door should not have been left open.",
    "As the villain of the\npiece Dr Nicholson seemed regrettably careless.",
    "No tame pythons thought Bobby.",
    "No cheetahs no electricallycharged wires  the man is shamefully behind the times.",
    "He made\nthese reflections more to cheer himself up than for any other\n\n\freason.",
    "Every time he thought of Moira a queer constriction\nseemed to tighten around his heart.",
    "Her face rose in the air before him  the trembling lips  the wide\nterrified eyes.",
    "It was just about here he had first seen her in the\nflesh.",
    "A little thrill ran through him as he remembered how he had\nput his arm round her to steady her.",
    "Moira  where was she now What had that sinister doctor done\nwith her If only she were still alive.",
    "She must be said Bobby grimly between set lips.",
    "Im not going to\nthink anything else.",
    "He made a careful reconnaissance round the\nhouse.",
    "Some of the upstairs windows had lights in them and there\nwas one lighted window on the ground floor.",
    "Towards this window Bobby crept.",
    "The curtains were drawn across\nit but there was a slight chink between them.",
    "Bobby put a knee on the windowsill and hoisted himself noiselessly\nup.",
    "He peered through the slits.",
    "He could see a mans arm and shoulder moving along as though\nwriting.",
    "Presently the man shifted his position and his profile came\ninto view.",
    "It was Dr Nicholson.",
    "It was a curious position.",
    "Quite unconscious that he was being\nwatched the doctor wrote steadily on.",
    "A queer sort of fascination\nstole over Bobby.",
    "The man was so near him that but for the\n\n\fintervening glass he could have stretched out his arm and touched\nhim.",
    "For the first time Bobby felt he was really seeing the man.",
    "It was a forceful profile the big bold nose the jutting chin the\ncrisp wellshaven line of the jaw.",
    "The ears Bobby noted were\nsmall and laid flat to the head and the lobe of the ear was actually\njoined to the cheek.",
    "He had an idea that ears like these were said to\nhave some special significance.",
    "The doctor wrote on  calm and unhurried.",
    "Now pausing for a\nmoment or two as though to think of the right word  then setting to\nonce more.",
    "His pen moved over the paper precisely and evenly.",
    "Once he took off his princenez polished them and put them on\nagain.",
    "At last with a sigh Bobby let himself slide noiselessly to the ground.",
    "From the look of it Nicholson would be writing for some time to\ncome.",
    "Now was the moment to gain admission to the house.",
    "If Bobby could force an entrance by an upstairs window while the\ndoctor was writing in his study he could explore the building at his\nleisure later in the night.",
    "He made a circuit of the house again and singled out a window on\nthe first floor.",
    "The sash was open at the top but there was no light in\nthe room so that it was probably unoccupied at the moment.",
    "Moreover a very convenient tree seemed to promise an easy\nmeans of access.",
    "In another minute Bobby was swarming up the tree.",
    "All went well\nand he was just stretching out his hand to take a grip of the window\nledge when an ominous crack came from the branch he was on and\nthe next minute the bough a rotten one had snapped and Bobby\nwas pitchforked head first into a clump of hydrangea bushes below\nwhich fortunately broke his fall.",
    "The window of Nicholsons study was farther along on the same\nside of the house.",
    "Bobby heard an exclamation in the doctors voice\nand the window was flung up.",
    "Bobby recovering from the first\nshock of his fall sprang up disentangled himself from the\nhydrangeas and bolted across the dark patch of shadow into the\npathway leading to the little door.",
    "He went a short way along it then\ndived into the bushes.",
    "He heard the sound of voices and saw lights moving near the\ntrampled and broken hydrangeas.",
    "Bobby kept still and held his\nbreath.",
    "They might come along the path.",
    "If so finding the door\nopen they would probably conclude that anyone had escaped that\nway and would not prosecute the search further.",
    "However the minutes passed and nobody came.",
    "Presently Bobby\nheard Nicholsons voice raised in a question.",
    "He did not hear the\nwords but he heard an answer given in a hoarse rather\nuneducated voice.",
    "All present and correct sir.",
    "Ive made the rounds.",
    "The sounds\ngradually died down the lights disappeared.",
    "Everyone seemed to have returned to the house.",
    "Very cautiously Bobby came out of his hiding place.",
    "He emerged\non to the path listening.",
    "All was still.",
    "He took a step or two towards\nthe house.",
    "And then out of the darkness something struck him on the back of\nthe neck.",
    "He fell forward... into darkness.",
    "CHAPTER 27 My Brother was Murdered\n\nOn Friday morning the green Bentley drew up outside the Station\nHotel at Ambledever.",
    "Frankie had wired Bobby under the name they had agreed upon George Parker  that she would be required to give evidence at the\ninquest on Henry Bassingtonffrench and would call in at\nAmbledever on the way down from London.",
    "She had expected a wire in reply appointing some rendezvous but\nnothing had come so she had come to the hotel.",
    "Mr Parker miss said the boots.",
    "I dont think theres any\ngentleman of that name stopping here but Ill see.",
    "He returned a\nfew minutes later.",
    "Came here Wednesday evening miss.",
    "Left his bag and said he\nmightnt be in till late.",
    "His bags still here but he hasnt been back to\nfetch it.",
    "Frankie felt suddenly rather sick.",
    "She clutched at a table\nfor support.",
    "The man was looking at her sympathetically.",
    "Feeling bad miss he inquired.",
    "Frankie shook her head.",
    "Its all right she managed to say.",
    "He didnt leave any message\nThe man went away again and returned shaking his head.",
    "Theres a telegram come for him he said.",
    "Thats all.",
    "He looked at\nher curiously.",
    "Anything I can do miss he asked.",
    "Frankie shook her head.",
    "At the moment she only wanted to get away.",
    "She must have time to\nthink what to do next.",
    "Its all right she said and getting into the Bentley she drove away.",
    "The man nodded his head wisely as he looked after her.",
    "Hes done a bunk he has he said to himself.",
    "Disappointed her.",
    "Given her the slip.",
    "A fine rakish piece of goods she is.",
    "Wonder what he was like He asked the young lady in the\nreception office but the young lady couldnt remember.",
    "A couple of nobs said the boots wisely.",
    "Going to get married on\nthe quiet  and hes hooked it.",
    "Meanwhile Frankie was driving in\nthe direction of Staverley her mind a maze of conflicting emotions.",
    "Why had Bobby not returned to the Station Hotel There could only\nbe two reasons either he was on the trail  and that trail had taken\nhim away somewhere or else  or else something had gone wrong.",
    "The Bentley swerved dangerously.",
    "Frankie recovered control just in time.",
    "She was being an idiot  imagining things.",
    "Of course Bobby was all\nright.",
    "He was on the trail  that was allon the trail.",
    "But why asked another voice hadnt he sent her a word of\nreassurance\n\nThat was more difficult to explain but there were explanations.",
    "Difficult circumstances  no time or opportunity Bobby would know\nthat she Frankie wouldnt get the wind up about him.",
    "Everything\nwas all right  bound to be.",
    "The inquest passed like a dream.",
    "Roger was there and Sylvia looking quite beautiful in her widows weeds.",
    "She made an\nimpressive figure and a moving one.",
    "Frankie found herself admiring\nher as though she were admiring a performance at a theatre.",
    "The proceedings were very tactfully conducted.",
    "The Bassingtonffrenches were popular locally and everything was done to spare\nthe feelings of the widow and the brother of the dead man.",
    "Frankie and Roger gave their evidence  Dr Nicholson gave his  the\ndead mans farewell letter was produced.",
    "The thing seemed over in\nno time and the verdict given  Suicide while of Unsound Mind.",
    "The sympathetic verdict as Mr Spragge had called it.",
    "The two events connected themselves in Frankies mind.",
    "Two suicides while of Unsound Mind.",
    "Was there  could there be a\nconnection between them\n\nThat this suicide was genuine enough she knew for she had been\non the scene.",
    "Bobbys theory of murder had had to be dismissed as\nuntenable.",
    "Dr Nicholsons alibi was cast iron vouched for by the\nwidow herself.",
    "Frankie and Dr Nicholson remained behind after the other people\ndeparted the coroner having shaken hands with Sylvia and uttered\na few words of sympathy.",
    "I think there are some letters for you Frankie dear said Sylvia.",
    "You wont mind if I leave you now and go and lie down.",
    "Its all been so awful.",
    "She shivered and left the room.",
    "Nicholson\nwent with her murmuring something about a sedative.",
    "Frankie turned to Roger.",
    "Roger Bobbys disappeared.",
    "Disappeared Yes Where and\nhow Frankie explained in a few rapid words.",
    "And hes not been seen since said Roger.",
    "No.",
    "What do you think I dont like the sound of it said Roger\nslowly.",
    "Frankies heart sank.",
    "You dont think   Oh it may be all right but  sh here comes\nNicholson.",
    "The doctor entered the room with his noiseless tread.",
    "He was rubbing his hands together and smiling.",
    "That went off very well he said.",
    "Very well indeed.",
    "Dr Davidson\nwas most tactful and considerate.",
    "We may consider ourselves very\nlucky to have had him as our local coroner.",
    "I suppose so said\nFrankie mechanically.",
    "It makes a lot of difference.",
    "Lady Frances.",
    "The conduct of an\ninquest is entirely in the hands of the coroner.",
    "He has wide powers.",
    "He can make things easy or difficult as he pleases.",

    "I feel the same.",
    "My brother was murdered Dr Nicholson.",
    "He was standing behind\nthe other and did not see as Frankie did the startled expression\nthat sprang into the doctors eyes.",
    "I mean what I say said Roger interrupting Nicholson as he was\nabout to reply.",
    "The law may not regard it as such but murder it\nwas.",
    "The criminal brutes who induced my brother to become a\nslave to that drug murdered him just as truly as if they had struck\nhim down.",
    "He had moved a little and his angry eyes now looked\nstraight into the doctors.",
    "I mean to get even with them he said and the words sounded like\na threat.",
    "Dr Nicholsons paleblue eyes fell before his.",
    "He shook his head\nsadly.",
    "I cannot say I disagree with you he said.",
    "I know more about drugtaking than you do Mr Bassingtonffrench.",
    "To induce a man to take\ndrugs is indeed a most terrible crime.",
    "Ideas were whirling through\nFrankies head  one idea in particular.",
    "It cant be she was saying to herself.",
    "That would be too\nmonstrous.",
    "And yet his whole alibi depends on her word.",
    "But in\nthat case  j She roused herself to find Nicholson speaking to her.",
    "You came down by car.",
    "Lady Frances No accident this time\nFrankie felt she simply hated that smile.",
    "No she said.",
    "I think its a pity to go in too much for accidents dont you She wondered if she had imagined it or whether his\neyelids really flickered for a moment.",
    "Perhaps your chauffeur drove you this time My chauffeur said\nFrankie has disappeared.",
    "She looked straight at Nicholson.",
    "Indeed He was last seen heading for the Grange went on\nFrankie.",
    "Nicholson raised his eyebrows.",
    "Really Have I  some attraction in the kitchen His voice sounded\namused.",
    "I can hardly believe it.",
    "At any rate that is where he was\nlast seen said Frankie.",
    "You sound quite dramatic said Nicholson.",
    "Possibly you are\npaying too much attention to local gossip.",
    "Local gossip is very\nunreliable.",
    "I have heard the wildest stories.",
    "He paused.",
    "His voice altered slightly in tone.",
    "I have even had a story brought to\nmy ears that my wife and your chauffeur had been seen talking\ntogether down by the river.",
    "Another pause.",
    "He was I believe a\nvery superior young man.",
    "Lady Frances.",
    "Is that it thought\nFrankie.",
    "Is he going to pretend that his wife has run off with my\nchauffeur Is that his little game Aloud she said Hawkins is quite\nabove the average chauffeur.",
    "So it seems said Nicholson.",
    "He turned to Roger.",
    "I must be going.",
    "Believe me all my sympathies are with you and\nMrs Bassingtonffrench.",
    "Roger went out into the hall with him.",
    "Frankie followed.",
    "On the hall table were a couple of letters\naddressed to her.",
    "One was a bill.",
    "The other Her heart gave a leap.",
    "The other was in Bobbys handwriting.",
    "Nicholson and Roger were on the doorstep.",
    "She tore it open.",
    "Dear Frankie wrote Bobby Im on the trail at last.",
    "Follow me as\nsoon as possible to Chipping Somerton.",
    "Youd better come by train\nand not by car.",
    "The Bentley is too noticeable.",
    "The trains arent too\ngood but you can get there all right.",
    "Youre to come to a house\ncalled Tudor Cottage.",
    "Ill explain to you just exactly how to find it.",
    "Dont ask the way.",
    "Here followed some minute directions.",
    "Have\nyou got that clear Dont tell anyone.",
    "This was heavily underlined.",
    "No one at all.",
    "Yours ever Bobby.",
    "Frankie crushed the letter excitedly in the palm of her hand.",
    "So it was all right.",
    "Nothing dreadful had overtaken Bobby.",
    "He was on the trail  and by a coincidence on the same trail as\nherself.",
    "She had been to Somerset House to look up the will of John\n\n\fSavage.",
    "Rose Emily Templeton was given as the wife of Edgar\nTempleton of Tudor Cottage Chipping Somerton.",
    "And that again had fitted in with the open ABC in the St Leonards\nGardens house.",
    "Chipping Somerton had been one of the stations on\nthe open page.",
    "The Caymans had gone to Chipping Somerton.",
    "Everything was falling into place.",
    "They were nearing the end of the\nchase.",
    "Roger Bassingtonffrench turned and came towards her.",
    "Anything interesting in your letter he inquired casually.",
    "For a moment Frankie hesitated.",
    "Surely Bobby had not meant\nRoger when he adjured her to tell nobody\n\nThen she remembered the heavy underlining  remembered too\nher own recent monstrous idea.",
    "If that were true Roger might\nbetray them both in all innocence.",
    "She dared not hint to him her\nown suspicions.",
    "So she made up her mind and spoke.",
    "No she said.",
    "Nothing at all.",
    "She was to repent her decision\nbitterly before twentyfour hours had passed.",
    "More than once in the course of the next few hours did she bitterly\nregret Bobbys dictum that the car was not to be used.",
    "Chipping Somerton was no very great distance as the crow flies but\nit involved changing three times with a long dreary wait at a\ncountry station each time and to one of Frankies impatient\ntemperament this slow method of procedure was extremely hard to\nendure with fortitude.",
    "Still she felt bound to admit that there was something in what\nBobby had said.",
    "The Bentley was a noticeable car.",
    "Her excuses for leaving it at Merroway had been of the flimsiest\norder but she had been unable to think of anything brilliant on the\nspur of the moment.",
    "It was getting dark when Frankies train an extremely deliberate\nand thoughtful train drew into the little station of Chipping\nSomerton.",
    "To Frankie it seemed more like midnight.",
    "The train seemed to her to have been ambling on for hours and\nhours.",
    "It was just beginning to rain too which was additionally trying.",
    "Frankie buttoned up her coat to her neck took a last look at\nBobbys letter by the light of the station lamp got the directions\nclearly in her head and set off.",
    "The instructions were quite easy to follow.",
    "Frankie saw the lights of\nthe village ahead and turned off to the left up a lane which led\nsteeply uphill.",
    "At the top of the lane she took the righthand fork and\npresently saw the little cluster of houses that formed the village\n\n\flying below her and a belt of pine trees ahead.",
    "Finally she came to\na neat wooden gate and striking a match saw Tudor Cottage\nwritten on it.",
    "There was no one about.",
    "Frankie slipped up the latch and passed\ninside.",
    "She could make out the outlines of the house behind a belt of\npine trees.",
    "She took up her post within the trees where she could\nget a clear view of the house.",
    "Then heart beating a little faster she\ngave the best imitation she could of the hoot of an owl.",
    "A few\nminutes passed and nothing happened.",
    "She repeated the call.",
    "The door of the cottage opened and she saw a figure in chauffeurs\ndress peer cautiously out.",
    "Bobby He made a beckoning gesture\nthen withdrew inside leaving the door ajar.",
    "Frankie came out from the trees and up to the door.",
    "There was no\nlight in any window.",
    "Everything was perfectly dark and silent.",
    "Frankie stepped gingerly over the threshold into a dark hall.",
    "She stopped peering about her.",
    "Bobby she whispered.",
    "It was her nose that gave her warning.",
    "Where had she known that\nsmell before  that heavy sweet odour\n\nJust as her brain gave the answer Chloroform strong arms seized\nher from behind.",
    "She opened her mouth to scream and a wet pad\nwas clapped over it.",
    "The sweet cloying smell filled her nostrils.",
    "She fought desperately twisting and turning kicking.",
    "But it was of\nno avail.",
    "Despite the fight she put up she felt herself succumbing.",
    "There was a drumming in her ears she felt herself choking.",
    "And\nthen she knew no more...\n\nCHAPTER 28 At the Eleventh Hour\n\nWhen Frankie came to herself the immediate reactions were\ndepressing.",
    "There is nothing romantic about the after effects of\nchloroform.",
    "She was lying on an extremely hard wooden floor and\nher hands and feet were tied.",
    "She managed to roll herself over and\nher head nearly collided violently with a battered coalbox.",
    "Various distressing events then occurred.",
    "A few minutes later Frankie was able if not to sit up at least to\ntake notice.",
    "Close at hand she heard a faint groan.",
    "She peered about her.",
    "As far as she could make out she seemed to be in a kind of attic.",
    "The only light came from a skylight in the roof and at this moment\nthere was very little of that.",
    "In a few minutes it would be quite dark.",
    "There were a few broken pictures lying against the wall a\ndilapidated iron bed and some broken chairs and the coalscuttle\nbefore mentioned.",
    "The groan seemed to have come from the corner.",
    "Frankies bonds were not very tight.",
    "They permitted motion of a\nsomewhat crablike type.",
    "She wormed her way across the dusty\nfloor.",
    "Bobby she ejaculated.",
    "Bobby it was also tied hand and foot.",
    "In addition he had a piece of\ncloth bound round his mouth.",
    "This he had almost succeeded in working loose.",
    "Frankie came to\nhis assistance.",
    "In spite of being bound together her hands were\nstill of some use and a final vigorous pull with her teeth finally did\nthe job.",
    "Rather stiffly Bobby managed to ejaculate Frankie Im glad\nwere together said Frankie.",
    "But it does look as though wed been\nhad for mugs.",
    "I suppose said Bobby gloomily its what they call a\nfair cop.",
    "How did they get you demanded Frankie.",
    "Was it after\nyou wrote that letter to me What letter I never wrote any letter.",
    "Oh I see said Frankie her eyes opening.",
    "What an idiot I have\nbeen And all that stuff in it about not telling a soul.",
    "Look here\nFrankie Ill tell you what happened to me and then you carry on the\ngood work and tell me what happened to you.",
    "He described his\nadventures at the Grange and their sinister sequel.",
    "I came to in this beastly hole he said.",
    "There was some food and\ndrink on a tray.",
    "I was frightfully hungry and I had some.",
    "I think it must have been doped for I fell asleep almost immediately.",
    "What day is it Friday.",
    "And I was knocked out on Wednesday\nevening.",
    "Dash it all Ive been pretty well unconscious all the time.",
    "Now tell me what happened to you Frankie recounted her\nadventures beginning with the story she had heard from Mr\nSpragge and carrying on until she thought she recognized Bobbys\nfigure in the doorway.",
    "And then they chloroformed me she finished.",
    "And oh Bobby Ive\njust been sick in a coalbucket I call that very resourceful of you\nFrankie said Bobby approvingly.",
    "With your hands tied and\neverything The thing is what are we going to do now Weve had it\nour own way for a long time but now the tables are turned.",
    "If only\nId told Roger about your letter lamented Frankie.",
    "I did think of it and wavered  and then I decided to do exactly what\nyou said and tell nobody at all.",
    "With the result that no one knows\nwhere we are said Bobby gravely.",
    "Frankie my dear Im afraid Ive\nlanded you in a mess.",
    "We got a bit too sure of ourselves said\nFrankie sombrely.",
    "The only thing I cant make out is why they didnt knock us both on\nthe head straight away mused Bobby.",
    "I dont think Nicholson\nwould stick at a little trifle like that.",
    "Hes got a plan said Frankie\nwith a slight shiver.",
    "Well wed better have one too.",
    "Weve got to get out of this\nFrankie.",
    "How are we going to do it We can shout said Frankie.",
    "Yees said Bobby.",
    "Somebody might be passing and hear.",
    "But from the fact that Nicholson didnt gag you I should say that the\nchances in that direction are pretty poor.",
    "Your hands are more\nloosely tied than mine.",
    "Lets see if I can get them undone with my\nteeth.",
    "The next five minutes were spent in a struggle that did credit\nto Bobbys dentist.",
    "Extraordinary how easy these things sound in books he panted.",
    "I\ndont believe Im making the slightest impression.",
    "You are said\nFrankie.",
    "Its loosening.",
    "Look out Theres somebody coming.",
    "She\nrolled away from him.",
    "A step could be heard mounting a stair a\nheavy ponderous tread.",
    "A gleam of light appeared under the door.",
    "Then there was the sound of a key being turned in the lock.",
    "The\ndoor swung slowly open.",
    "And how are my two little birds said the voice of Dr Nicholson.",
    "He carried a candle in one hand and though he was wearing a hat\npulled down over his eyes and a heavy overcoat with the collar\nturned up his voice would have betrayed him anywhere.",
    "His eyes glittered palely behind the strong glasses.",
    "He shook his head at them playfully.",
    "Unworthy of you my dear young lady he said to fall into the trap\nso easily.",
    "Neither Bobby nor Frankie made any reply.",
    "The honours\nof the situation so obviously lay with Nicholson that it was difficult\nto know what to say.",
    "Nicholson put the candle down on a chair.",
    "At any rate he said let me see if you are comfortable.",
    "He\nexamined Bobbys fastenings nodded his head approvingly and\npassed on to Frankie.",
    "There he shook his head.",
    "As they truly used to say to me in my youth he remarked fingers\nwere made before forks  and teeth were used before fingers.",
    "Your\nyoung friends teeth I see have been active.",
    "A heavy brokenbacked oak chair was standing in a corner.",
    "Nicholson picked up Frankie deposited her on the chair and tied\nher securely to it.",
    "Not too uncomfortable I trust he said.",
    "Well it isnt for long.",
    "Frankie found her tongue.",
    "What are you going to do with us she demanded.",
    "Nicholson walked to the door and picked up his candle.",
    "You taunted me.",
    "Lady Frances with being too fond of accidents.",
    "Perhaps I am.",
    "At any rate I am going to risk one more accident.",
    "What do you mean said Bobby.",
    "Shall I tell you Yes I think I will.",
    "Lady Frances Derwent driving\nher car her chauffeur beside her mistakes a turning and takes a\ndisused road leading to a quarry.",
    "The car crashes over the edge.",
    "Lady Frances and her chauffeur are killed.",
    "There was a slight\npause then Bobby said But we mightnt be.",
    "Plans go awry\n\n\fsometimes.",
    "One of yours did down in Wales.",
    "Your tolerance of\nmorphia was certainly very remarkable and from our point of view regrettable said Nicholson.",
    "But you need have no anxiety on my\nbehalf this time.",
    "You and Lady Frances will be quite dead when your\nbodies are discovered.",
    "Bobby shivered in spite of himself.",
    "There\nhad been a queer note in Nicholsons voice  it was the tone of an\nartist contemplating a masterpiece.",
    "He enjoys this thought Bobby.",
    "Really enjoys it.",
    "He was not going\nto give Nicholson further cause for enjoyment than he could help.",
    "He said in a casual tone of voice Youre making a mistake especially where Lady Frances is concerned.",
    "Yes said Frankie.",
    "In that very clever letter you forged you told me to tell nobody.",
    "Well I made just one exception.",
    "I told Roger Bassingtonffrench.",
    "He\nknows all about you.",
    "If anything happens to us he will know who is\nresponsible for it.",
    "Youd better let us go and clear out of the country\nas fast as you can.",
    "Nicholson was silent for a moment.",
    "Then he\nsaid A good bluff  but I call it.",
    "He turned to the door.",
    "What about your wife you swine cried Bobby.",
    "Have you\nmurdered her too Moira i\u00a7 still alive said Nicholson.",
    "How much\nlonger she will remain so I do not really know.",
    "It depends on\ncircumstances.",
    "He made them a mocking little bow.",
    "Au revoir he said.",
    "It will take me a couple of hours to complete my\narrangements.",
    "You may enjoy talking the matter over.",
    "I shall not\ngag you unless it becomes necessary.",
    "You understand Any calls\nfor help and I return and deal with the matter.",
    "He went out and\nclosed and locked the door behind him.",
    "It isnt true said Bobby.",
    "It cant be true.",
    "These things dont\nhappen.",
    "But he could not help feeling that they were going to\nhappen  and to him and Frankie.",
    "In books theres always an eleventhhour rescue said Frankie\ntrying to speak hopefully.",
    "But she was not feeling very hopeful.",
    "In fact her morale was\ndecidedly low.",
    "The whole things so impossible said Bobby as though pleading\nwith someone.",
    "So fantastic.",
    "Nicholson himself was absolutely\nunreal.",
    "I wish an eleventhhour rescue was possible but I cant see\nwhos going to rescue us.",
    "If only Id told Roger wailed Frankie.",
    "Perhaps in spite of everything Nicholson believes you have\nsuggested Bobby.",
    "No said Frankie.",
    "The suggestion didnt go down at all.",
    "The mans too damned clever.",
    "Hes been too clever for us said\nBobby gloomily.",
    "Frankie do you know what annoys me most about\nthis business No.",
    "What That even now when were going to be\nhurled into the next world we still dont know who Evans is.",
    "Lets\nask him said Frankie.",
    "You know  a lastminute boon.",
    "He cant\nrefuse to tell us.",
    "I agree with you that I simply cant die without\nhaving my curiosity satisfied.",
    "There was a silence then Bobby\nsaid Do you think we ought to yell for help  a sort of last chance\nIts about the only chance weve got.",
    "Not yet said Frankie.",
    "In the\nfirst place I dont believe anyone would hear  hed never risk it\n\n\fotherwise  and in the second place I feel I just cant bear waiting\nhere to be killed without being able to speak or be spoken to.",
    "Lets\nleave shouting till the last possible moment.",
    "Its  its so comforting\nhaving you to talk to.",
    "Her voice wavered a little over the last words.",
    "Ive got you into an awful mess Frankie.",
    "Oh thats all right.",
    "You\ncouldnt have kept me out.",
    "I wanted to come in.",
    "Bobby do you think\nhell really pull it off\n\nUs I mean.",
    "Im terribly afraid he will.",
    "Hes so damnably efficient.",
    "Bobby do you believe now that it was he who killed Henry\nBassingtonffrench If it were possible  It is possible  granted one\nthing that Sylvia Bassingtonffrench is in it too.",
    "Frankie I know.",
    "I\nwas just as horrified when the idea occurred to me.",
    "But it fits.",
    "Why was Sylvia so dense about the morphia  why did she\nresist so obstinately when we wanted her to send her husband\nsomewhere else instead of the Grange And then she was in the\nhouse when the shot was fired  She might have done it herself.",
    "Oh no surely.",
    "Yes she might.",
    "And then have given the key of the\nstudy to Nicholson to put in Henrys pocket.",
    "Its all crazy said\nFrankie in a hopeless voice.",
    "Like looking through a distorting\nmirror.",
    "All the people who seemed most all right are really all wrong\n all the nice everyday people.",
    "There ought to be some way of telling criminals  eyebrows or ears\nor something.",
    "My God cried Bobby.",
    "What is it Frankie that wasnt Nicholson who came here just\nnow.",
    "Have you gone quite mad Who was it then I dont know \n\n\fbut it wasnt Nicholson.",
    "All along I felt there was something wrong\nbut couldnt spot it and your saying ears has given me the clue.",
    "When I was watching Nicholson the other evening through the\nwindow I especially noticed his ears  the lobes are joined to the\nface.",
    "But this man tonight  his ears werent like that.",
    "But what\ndoes it mean Frankie asked hopelessly.",
    "This is a very clever actor impersonating Nicholson.",
    "But why  and\nwho could it be Bassingtonffrench breathed Bobby.",
    "Roger\nBassingtonffrench We spotted the right man at the beginning and\nthen like idiots we went astray after red herrings.",
    "Bassingtonffrench whispered Frankie.",
    "Bobby youre right.",
    "It must be him.",
    "He\nwas the only person there when I taunted Nicholson about\naccidents.",
    "Then it really is all up said Bobby.",
    "Ive still had a kind\nof sneaking hope that possibly Roger Bassingtonffrench might\nnose out our trail by some miracle but now the last hopes gone.",
    "Moiras a prisoner you and I are tied hand and foot.",
    "Nobody else\nhas the least idea where we are.",
    "The games up Frankie.",
    "As he\nfinished speaking there was a sound overhead.",
    "The next minute\nwith a terrific crash a heavy body fell through the skylight.",
    "It was too dark to see anything.",
    "What the devil  began Bobby.",
    "From amidst a pile of broken glass a voice spoke.",
    "Bbbbobby it said.",
    "Well Im damned said Bobby.",
    "Its Badger\n\nCHAPTER 29 Badgers Story\n\nThere was not a minute to be lost.",
    "Already sounds could be heard\non the floor below.",
    "Quick Badger you fool said Bobby.",
    "Pull one of my boots off\nDont argue or ask questions Haul it off somehow.",
    "Chuck it down in\nthe middle there and crawl under that bed Quick I tell you Steps\nwere ascending the stairs.",
    "The key turned.",
    "Nicholson  the pseudo Nicholson  stood in the doorway candle in\nhand.",
    "He saw Bobby and Frankie as he had left them but in the middle of\nthe floor was a pile of broken glass and in the middle of the broken\nglass was a boot\n\nNicholson stared in amazement from the boot to Bobby.",
    "Bobbys left foot was bootless.",
    "Very clever my young friend he said dryly.",
    "Extremely acrobatic.",
    "He came over to Bobby examined the ropes that bound him and\ntied a couple of extra knots.",
    "He looked at him curiously.",
    "I wish I knew how you managed to throw that boot through the\nskylight It seems almost incredible.",
    "A touch of the Houdini about\n\n\fyou my friend.",
    "He looked at them both up at the broken skylight\nthen shrugging his shoulders he left the room.",
    "Quick Badger.",
    "Badger crawled out from under the bed.",
    "He had a\npocket knife and with its aid he soon cut the other two free.",
    "Thats better said Bobby stretching himself.",
    "Whew Im stiff Well\nFrankie what about our friend Nicholson Youre right said\nFrankie.",
    "Its Roger Bassingtonffrench.",
    "Now that I know hes Roger playing the part of Nicholson I can see\nit.",
    "But its a pretty good performance all the same.",
    "Entirely voice\nand pincenez said Bobby.",
    "I was at Oxford with a Bbbbassingtonffrench said Badger.",
    "Mmmmarvellous actor.",
    "Bbbbad hat though.",
    "Bbbbad business\nabout forging his pppaters nnnname to a cheque.",
    "Old mmman\nhushed it up.",
    "In the minds of both Bobby and Frankie was the same\nthought.",
    "Badger whom they had judged it wiser not to take into\ntheir confidence could all along have given them valuable\ninformation\n\nForgery said Frankie thoughtfully.",
    "That letter from you Bobby\nwas remarkably well done.",
    "I wonder how he knew your\nhandwriting If hes in with the Caymans he probably saw my letter\nabout the Evans business.",
    "The voice of Badger rose plaintively.",
    "Wwwwhat are we going to do next he inquired.",
    "Were going to take up a comfortable position behind this door\nsaid Bobby.",
    "And when our friend returns which I imagine wont be\nfor a little while yet you and I are going to spring on him from\nbehind and give him the surprise of his life.",
    "How about it.",
    "Badger Are you game Oh absolutely.",
    "As for you\nFrankie when you hear his step youd better get back on to your\nchair.",
    "Hell see you as soon as he opens the door and will come in\nwithout any suspicion.",
    "All right said Frankie.",
    "And once you and\nBadger have got him down Ill join in and bite his ankles or\nsomething.",
    "Thats\n\nthe\n\ntrue\n\nwomanly\n\nspirit\n\nsaid\n\nBobby\n\napprovingly.",
    "Now lets all sit close together on the floor here and hear all about\nthings.",
    "I want to know what miracle brought Badger through that\nskylight.",
    "Well you sssee said Badger after you wwwent off I\ngot into a bit of a mmmess.",
    "He paused.",
    "Gradually the story was\nextracted a tale of liabilities creditors and bailiffs  a typical\nBadger catastrophe.",
    "Bobby had gone off leaving no address only saying that he was\ndriving the Bentley down to Staveriey.",
    "So to Staverley came\nBadger.",
    "I thought ppperhaps you mmmight be able to let have a fffiver\nhe explained.",
    "Bobbys heart smote him.",
    "To aid Badger in his enterprise he had\ncome to London and had promptly deserted his post to go off\n\n\fsleuthing with Frankie.",
    "And even now the faithful Badger uttered no\nword of reproach.",
    "Badger had no wish to endanger Bobbys mysterious enterprises\nbut he was of the opinion that a car like the green Bentley would not\nbe difficult to find in a place the size of Staverley.",
    "As a matter of fact he came across the car before he got to\nStaverley for it was standing outside a pub  empty.",
    "Ssso I thought went on Badger that Id give you a little ssssurprise dont you know There were some rrrugs and things in\nthe bbback and nobody about.",
    "I gggot in and ppppulled them\nover me.",
    "I thought Id give you the sssurprise of your life.",
    "What\nactually happened was that a chauffeur in green livery had\nemerged from the pub and that Badger peering from his place of\nconcealment was thunderstruck to perceive that this chauffeur\nwas not Bobby.",
    "He had an idea that the face was in some way\nfamiliar to him but couldnt place the man.",
    "The stranger got into the\ncar and drove off.",
    "Badger was in a predicament.",
    "He did not know what to do next.",
    "Explanations and apologies were difficult and in any case it is not\neasy to explain to someone who is driving a car at sixty miles an\nhour.",
    "Badger decided to lie low and sneak out of the car when it\nstopped.",
    "The car finally reached its destination  Tudor Cottage.",
    "The\nchauffeur drove it into the garage and left it there but on going\nout he shut the garage doors.",
    "Badger was a prisoner.",
    "There was a\n\n\fsmall window at one side of the garage and through this about half\nan hour later Badger had observed Frankies approach her whistle\nand her admission into the house.",
    "The whole business puzzled Badger greatly.",
    "He began to suspect\nthat something was wrong.",
    "At any rate he determined to have a\nlook round for himself and see what it was all about.",
    "With the help of some tools lying about in the garage he succeeded\nin picking the lock of the garage door and set out on a tour of\ninspection.",
    "The windows on the ground floor were all shuttered but\nhe thought that by getting on to the roof he might manage to have a\nlook into some of the upper windows.",
    "The roof presented no difficulties.",
    "There was a convenient pipe\nrunning up the garage and from the garage roof to the roof of the\ncottage was an easy climb.",
    "In the course of his prowling Badger\nhad come upon the skylight.",
    "Nature and Badgers weight had done\nthe rest.",
    "Bobby drew a long breath as the narrative came to an end.",
    "All the same he said reverently you are a miracle  a singularly\nbeautiful miracle But for you.",
    "Badger my lad Frankie and I would\nhave been little corpses in about an hours time.",
    "He gave Badger a\ncondensed account of the activities of himself and Frankie.",
    "Towards the end he broke off.",
    "Someones coming.",
    "Get to your post Frankie.",
    "Now then this is\nwhere our playacting Bassingtonffrench gets the surprise of his\n\n\flife.",
    "Frankie arranged herself in a depressed attitude on the broken\nchair.",
    "Badger and Bobby stood ready behind the door.",
    "The steps came up the stairs a line of candlelight showed\nunderneath the door.",
    "The key was put in the lock and turned the\ndoor swung open.",
    "The light of the candle disclosed Frankie\ndrooping dejectedly on her chair.",
    "Their gaoler stepped through the\ndoorway.",
    "Then joyously.",
    "Badger and Bobby sprang.",
    "The proceedings were short and decisive.",
    "Taken utterly by\nsurprise the man was knocked down the candle flew wide and was\nretrieved by Frankie and a few seconds later the three friends\nstood looking down with malicious pleasure at a figure securely\nbound with the same ropes as had previously secured two of them.",
    "Good evening Mr Bassingtonffrench said Bobby  and if the\nexultation in his voice was a little crude who shall blame him Its a\nnice night for the funeral.",
    "CHAPTER 30 Escape\n\nThe man on the floor stared up at them.",
    "His pincenez had flown off\nand so had his hat.",
    "There could be no further attempt at disguise.",
    "Slight traces of makeup were visible about the eyebrows but\notherwise the face was the pleasant slightly vacuous face of Roger\nBassingtonffrench.",
    "He spoke in his own agreeable tenor voice its note that of pleasant\nsoliloquy.",
    "Very interesting he said.",
    "I really knew quite well that no man tied\nup as you were could have thrown a boot through that skylight.",
    "But\nbecause the boot was there among the broken glass I took it for\ncause and effect and assumed that though it was impossible the\nimpossible had been achieved.",
    "An interesting light on the\nlimitations of the brain.",
    "As nobody spoke he went on still in the\nsame reflective voice So after all youve won the round.",
    "Most\nunexpected and extremely regrettable.",
    "I thought Id got you all\nfooled nicely.",
    "So you had said Frankie.",
    "You forged that letter\nfrom Bobby I suppose I have a talent that way said Roger\nmodestly.",
    "And Bobby Lying on his back smiling agreeably Roger seemed\nto take a positive pleasure in enlightening them.",
    "I knew hed go to the Grange.",
    "I only had to wait about in the bushes\nnear the path.",
    "I was just behind him there when he retreated after\nrather clumsily falling off a tree.",
    "I let the hubbub die down and then\ngot him neatly on the back of the neck with a sandbag.",
    "All I had to\ndo was to carry him out to where my car was waiting shove him in\nthe dickey and drive him here.",
    "I was at home again before morning.",
    "And Moira demanded Bobby.",
    "Did you entice her away\nsomehow Roger chuckled.",
    "The question seemed to amuse him.",
    "Forgery is a very useful art my dear Jones he said.",
    "You swine said Bobby.",
    "Frankie intervened.",
    "She was still full of curiosity and their prisoner\nseemed in an obliging mood.",
    "Why did you pretend to be Dr Nicholson she asked.",
    "Why did I now Roger seemed to be asking the question of\nhimself.",
    "Partly I think the fun of seeing whether I could spoof you\nboth.",
    "You were so very sure that poor old Nicholson was in it up to\nthe neck.",
    "He laughed and Frankie blushed.",
    "Just because he crossquestioned you a bit about the details of your accident  in his\npompous way.",
    "It was an irritating fad of his accuracy in details.",
    "And really said Frankie slowly he was quite innocent As a child\nunborn said Roger.",
    "But he did me a good turn.",
    "He drew my attention to that accident of yours.",
    "That and another\nincident made me realize that you mightnt be quite the innocent\nyoung thing you seemed to be.",
    "And then I was standing by you\nwhen you telephoned one morning and heard your chauffeurs\nvoice say Frankie.",
    "Ive got pretty good hearing.",
    "I suggested\ncoming up to town with you and you agreed  but you were very\nrelieved when I changed my mind.",
    "After that  He stopped and as far as he was able shrugged his\nbound shoulders.",
    "It was rather fun seeing you all get worked up\nabout Nicholson.",
    "Hes a harmless old ass but he does look exactly\nlike a scientific supercriminal on the films.",
    "I thought I might as well\nkeep the deception up.",
    "After all you never know.",
    "The bestlaid plans go wrong as my present predicament shows.",
    "Theres one thing you must tell me said Frankie.",
    "Ive been driven\nnearly mad with curiosity.",
    "Who is Evans Oh said Bassingtonffrench.",
    "So you dont know that He laughed  and laughed again.",
    "Thats rather amusing he said.",
    "It shows what a fool one can be.",
    "Meaning us asked Frankie.",
    "No said Roger.",
    "In this case meaning me.",
    "Do you know if you\ndont know who Evans is I dont think I shall tell you.",
    "Ill keep that to myself as my own little secret.",
    "The position was a\ncurious one.",
    "They had turned the tables on Bassingtonffrench and\nyet in some peculiar way he had robbed them of their triumph.",
    "Lying on the floor bound and a prisoner it was he who dominated\nthe situation.",
    "And what are your plans now may I ask he inquired.",
    "Nobody had as yet evolved any plans.",
    "Bobby rather doubtfully\nmurmured something about police.",
    "Much the best thing to do said Roger cheerfully.",
    "Ring them up\nand hand me over to them.",
    "The charge will be abduction I suppose.",
    "I cant very well deny that.",
    "He looked at Frankie.",
    "I shall plead a\nguilty passion.",
    "Frankie reddened.",
    "What about murder she asked.",
    "My dear you havent any evidence.",
    "Positively none.",
    "Think it over\nand youll see you havent.",
    "Badger said Bobby youd better stay here and keep an eye on\nhim.",
    "Ill go down and ring the police.",
    "Youd better be careful said\nFrankie.",
    "We dont know how many of them there may be in the\nhouse.",
    "No one but me said Roger.",
    "I was carrying this through\nsinglehanded.",
    "Im not prepared to take your word for that said\nBobby gruffly.",
    "He bent over and tested the knots.",
    "Hes all right he said.",
    "Safe as houses.",
    "Wed better all go down\ntogether.",
    "We can lock the door.",
    "Terribly distrustful arent you my\ndear chap said Roger.",
    "Theres a pistol in my pocket if youd like it.",
    "It may make you feel\nhappier and its certainly no good to me in my present position.",
    "Ignoring the others mocking tone Bobby bent down and extracted\nthe weapon.",
    "Kind of you to mention it he said.",
    "If you want to know it does me\nme feel happier.",
    "Good said Roger.",
    "Its loaded.",
    "Bobby took the\ncandle and they filed out of the attic leaving Roger lying on the\nfloor.",
    "Bobby locked the door and put the key in his pocket.",
    "He held\nthe pistol in his hand.",
    "Ill go first he said.",
    "Weve got to be quite sure and not make a\nmess of things now.",
    "Hes a quququeer chap isnt he said\n\n\fBadger with a jerk of his head backwards in the direction of the\nroom they had left.",
    "Hes a damned good loser said Frankie.",
    "Even now she was not quite free from the charm of that very\nremarkable young man Roger Bassingtonffrench.",
    "A rather rickety flight of steps led down to the main landing.",
    "Everything was quiet.",
    "Bobby looked over the banisters.",
    "The\ntelephone was in the hall below.",
    "Wed better look into these rooms first he said.",
    "We dont want to\nbe taken in the rear.",
    "Badger flung open each door in turn.",
    "Of the\nfour bedrooms three were empty.",
    "In the fourth a slender figure was\nlying on the bed.",
    "Its Moira cried Frankie.",
    "The others crowded in.",
    "Moira was lying like one dead except that\nher breast moved up and down ever so slightly.",
    "Is she asleep asked Bobby.",
    "Shes drugged I think said Frankie.",
    "She looked round.",
    "A hypodermic syringe lay on a little enamel tray\non a table near the window.",
    "There was also a little spirit lamp and a\ntype of morphia hypodermic needle.",
    "Shell be all right I think she said.",
    "But we ought to get a doctor.",
    "Lets go down and telephone said Bobby.",
    "They adjourned to the hall below.",
    "Frankie had a half fear that the\ntelephone wires might be cut but her fears proved quite\nunfounded.",
    "They got through to the police station quite easily but\nfound a good deal of difficulty in explaining matters.",
    "The local police station was highly disposed to regard the summons\nas a practical joke.",
    "However they were convinced at last and Bobby replaced the\nreceiver with a sigh.",
    "He had explained that they also wanted a\ndoctor and the police constable promised to bring one along.",
    "Ten minutes later a car arrived with an inspector and a constable\nand an elderly man who had his profession stamped all over him.",
    "Bobby and Frankie received them and after explaining matters\nonce more in a somewhat perfunctory fashion led the way to the\nattic.",
    "Bobby unlocked the door  then stood dumbfounded in the\ndoorway.",
    "In the middle of the floor was a heap of severed ropes.",
    "Underneath the broken skylight a chair had been placed on the\nbed which had been dragged out till it was under the skylight.",
    "Of Roger Bassingtonffrench there was no sign.",
    "Bobby Badger and Frankie were dumbfounded.",
    "Talk of Houdini said Bobby.",
    "He must have outHoudinied Houdini.",
    "How the devil did he cut these cords He must have had a knife in\nhis pocket said Frankie.",
    "Even then how could he get at it Both hands were bound together\nbehind his back.",
    "The inspector coughed.",
    "All his former doubts had\nreturned.",
    "He was more strongly disposed than ever to regard the whole thing\nas a hoax.",
    "Frankie and Bobby found themselves telling a long story which\nsounded more impossible every minute.",
    "The doctor was their salvation.",
    "On being taken to the room where Moira was lying he declared at\nonce that she had been drugged with morphia or some preparation\nof opium.",
    "He did not consider her condition serious and thought she\nwould awake naturally in four or five hours time.",
    "He suggested taking her off then and there to a good nursing home\nin the neighbourhood.",
    "To this Bobby and Frankie agreed not seeing what else could be\ndone.",
    "Having given their own names and addresses to the\ninspector who appeared to disbelieve utterly in Frankies they\nthemselves were allowed to leave Tudor Cottage and with the\nassistance of the inspector succeeded in gaining admission to the\nSeven Stars in the village.",
    "Here still feeling that they were regarded as criminals they were\nonly too thankful to go to their rooms  a double one for Bobby and\nBadger and a very minute single one for Frankie.",
    "A few minutes after they had all retired a knock came on Bobbys\ndoor.",
    "It was Frankie.",
    "Ive thought of something she said.",
    "If that fool of a police\ninspector persists in thinking that we made all this up at any rate\nIve got evidence that I was chloroformed.",
    "Have you Where In\nthe coalbucket said Frankie with decision.",
    "CHAPTER 31 Frankie Asks a Question\n\nExhausted by all her adventures Frankie slept late the next\nmorning.",
    "It was halfpast ten when she came down to the small\ncoffee room to find Bobby waiting for her.",
    "Hullo Frankie here you are at last.",
    "Dont be so horribly vigorous\nmy dear Frankie subsided into a chair.",
    "What will you have Theyve got haddock and eggs and bacon and\ncold ham.",
    "I shall have some toast and weak tea said Frankie\nquelling him.",
    "What is the matter with you It must be the\nsandbagging said Bobby.",
    "Its probably broken up adhesions in the\nbrain.",
    "I feel absolutely full of pep and vim and bright ideas and a\n\n\flonging to dash out and do things.",
    "Well why not dash said\nFrankie languidly.",
    "I have dashed Ive been with Inspector Hammond for the last halfhour.",
    "Well have to let it go as a practical joke Frankie for the\nmoment.",
    "Oh but Bobby  I saidor the moment.",
    "Weve got to get to\nthe bottom of this Frankie.",
    "Were on the right spot and all weve got\nto do is to get down to it.",
    "We dont want Roger Bassingtonffrench\nfor abduction.",
    "We want him for murder.",
    "And well get him said\nFrankie with a rivival of spirit.",
    "Thats more like it said Bobby approvingly.",
    "Drink some more tea.",
    "Hows Moira Pretty bad.",
    "She came round in the most awful state\nof nerves.",
    "Scared stiff apparently.",
    "Shes gone up to London  to a\nnursing home place in Queens Gate.",
    "She says shell feel safe there.",
    "She was terrified here.",
    "She never did have much nerve said\nFrankie.",
    "Well anyone might be scared stiff with a queer coldblooded\nmurderer\n\nlike\n\nRoger\n\nBassingtonffrench\n\nloose\n\nin\n\nthe\n\nneighbourhood.",
    "He doesnt want to murder her.",
    "Were the ones\nhes after.",
    "Hes probably too busy taking care of himself to worry\nabout us for the moment said Bobby.",
    "Now Frankie weve got to\nget down to it.",
    "The start of the whole thing must be John Savages\ndeath and will.",
    "Theres something wrong about it.",
    "Either that will was forged or Savage was murdered or something.",
    "Its quite likely the will was forged if Bassingtonffrench was\nconcerned said Frankie thoughtfully.",
    "Forgery seems to be his\n\n\fspeciality.",
    "It may have been forgery and murder.",
    "Weve got to find\nout.",
    "Frankie nodded.",
    "Ive got the notes I made after looking at the will.",
    "The witnesses\nwere Rose Chudleigh cook and Albeit Mere gardener.",
    "They ought\nto be quite easy to find.",
    "Then there are the lawyers who drew it up Elford and Leigh  a very respectable firm as Mr Spragge said.",
    "Right well start from there.",
    "I think youd better take the lawyers.",
    "Youll get more out of them than I would.",
    "Ill hunt up Rose Chudleigh\nand Albeit Mere.",
    "What about Badger Badger never gets up till\nlunch time  you neednt worry about him.",
    "We must get his affairs\nstraightened out for him sometime said Frankie.",
    "After all he did\nsave my life.",
    "Theyll soon get tangled again said Bobby.",
    "Oh by\nthe way what do you think of this He held out a dirty piece of\ncardboard for her inspection.",
    "It was a photograph.",
    "Mr Cayman said Frankie immediately.",
    "Where did you get it Last\nnight.",
    "It had slipped down behind the telephone.",
    "Then it seems\npretty clear who Mr and Mrs Templeton were.",
    "Wait a minute.",
    "A\nwaitress had just approached bearing toast.",
    "Frankie displayed the\nphotograph.",
    "Do you know who that is she asked.",
    "The waitress regarded the photograph her head a little on one\nside.",
    "Now Ive seen the gentleman  but I cant quite call to mind.",
    "Oh\nyes its the gentleman who had Tudor Cottage  Mr Templeton.",
    "Theyve gone away now  somewhere abroad I believe.",
    "What sort\nof man was he asked Frankie.",
    "I really couldnt say.",
    "They didnt come down here very often  just\nweekends now and then.",
    "Nobody saw much of him.",
    "Mrs Templeton was a very nice lady.",
    "But they hadnt had Tudor\nCottage very long  Only about six months  when a very rich\ngentleman died and left Mrs Templeton all his money and they went\nto live abroad.",
    "They never sold Tudor Cottage though.",
    "I think they\nsometimes lend it to people for weekends.",
    "But I dont suppose with all that money theyll ever come back here\nand live in it themselves.",
    "They had a cook called Rose Chudleigh\ndidnt they asked Frankie.",
    "But the girl seemed uninterested in cooks.",
    "Being left a fortune by a\nrich gentleman was what really stirred her imagination.",
    "In answer\nto Frankies question she replied that she couldnt say she was\nsure and withdrew carrying an empty toastrack.",
    "Thats all plain sailing said Frankie.",
    "The Caymans have given up\ncoming here but they keep the place on for the convenience of the\ngang.",
    "They agreed to divide the labour as Bobby had suggested.",
    "Frankie went off in the Bentley having smartened herself up by a\nfew local purchases and Bobby went off in quest of Albeit Mere\nthe gardener.",
    "They met at lunch time.",
    "Well demanded Bobby.",
    "Frankie shook her head.",
    "Forgerys out of the question.",
    "She spoke in a dispirited voice.",
    "I\nspent a long time with Mr Elford  hes rather an old dear.",
    "Hed got\nwind of our doings last night and was wild to hear a few details.",
    "I\ndont suppose they get much excitement down here.",
    "Anyway I soon\ngot him eating out of my hand.",
    "Then I discussed the Savage case  pretended Id met some of the\nSavage relations and that theyd hinted at forgery.",
    "At that my old\ndear bristled up  absolutely out of the question It wasnt a question\nof letters or anything like that.",
    "He saw Mr Savage himself and Mr\nSavage insisted on the will being drawn up then and there.",
    "Mr\nElford wanted to go away and do it properly  you know how they do\n sheets and sheets all about nothing  I dont know said Bobby.",
    "Ive never made any wills.",
    "I have  two.",
    "The second was this\nmorning.",
    "I had to have some excuse for seeing a lawyer.",
    "Who did\nyou leave your money to You.",
    "That was a bit thoughtless wasnt\nit If Roger Bassingtonffrench succeeded in bumping you off I\nshould probably be hanged for it I never thought of that said\nFrankie.",
    "Well as I was saying Mr Savage was so nervous and\nwrought up that Mr Elford wrote out the will then and there and the\nservant and the gardener came and witnessed it and Mr Elford\ntook it away with him for safe keeping.",
    "That does seem to knock\nout forgery agreed Bobby.",
    "I know.",
    "You cant have forgery when youve actually seen the man\nsign his name.",
    "As to the other business  murder its going to be\nhard to find out anything about that now.",
    "The doctor who was\ncalled in has died since.",
    "The man we saw last night is a new man hes only been here about two months.",
    "We seem to have rather an\nunfortunate number of deaths said Bobby.",
    "Why who else is dead Albert Mere.",
    "Do you think theyve all been\nput out of the way That seems rather wholesale.",
    "We might give\nAlbert Mere the benefit of the doubt  he was seventytwo poor old\nman.",
    "All right said Frankie.",
    "Ill allow you Natural Causes in his\ncase.",
    "Any luck with Rose Chudleigh Yes.",
    "After she left the\nTempletons she went to the north of England to a place but shes\ncome back and married a man down here whom it seems shes\nbeen walking out with for the last seventeen years.",
    "Unfortunately\nshes a bit of a nitwit.",
    "She doesnt seem to remember anything\nabout anyone.",
    "Perhaps you could do something with her.",
    "Ill have a\ngo said Frankie.",
    "Im rather good with nitwits.",
    "Wheres Badger by the way Good Lord Ive forgotten all about\nhim said Bobby.",
    "He got up and left the room returning a few\nminutes later.",
    "He was still asleep he explained.",
    "Hes getting up now.",
    "A\nchambermaid seems to have called him four times but it didnt\nmake any impression.",
    "Well wed better go and see the nitwit said\nFrankie rising.",
    "And then I must buy a toothbrush and a nightgown and a sponge\nand a few other necessities of civilized existence.",
    "I was so close to\n\n\fNature last night that I didnt think about any of them.",
    "I just stripped\noff my outer covering and fell upon the bed.",
    "I know said Bobby.",
    "So did I.",
    "Lets go and talk to Rose Chudleigh said Frankie.",
    "Rose Chudleigh now Mrs Pratt lived in a small cottage that\nseemed to be overflowing with china dogs and furniture.",
    "Mrs Pratt\nherself was a bovinelooking woman of ample proportions with\nfishlike eyes and every indication of adenoids.",
    "You see Ive come back said Bobby breezily.",
    "Mrs Pratt breathed hard and looked at them both incuriously.",
    "We were so interested to hear that you had lived with Mrs\nTempleton explained Frankie.",
    "Yes maam said Mrs Pratt.",
    "Shes living abroad now I believe continued Frankie trying to\ngive an impression of being an intimate of the family.",
    "Ive heard so agreed Mrs Pratt.",
    "You were with her some time werent you asked Frankie.",
    "Were I which maam With Mrs Templeton some time said\nFrankie speaking slowly and clearly.",
    "I wouldnt say that maam.",
    "Only two months.",
    "Oh I thought youd\nbeen with her longer than that.",
    "That was Gladys maam.",
    "The\n\n\fhouseparlourmaid.",
    "She was there six months.",
    "There were two of\nyou Thats right.",
    "Houseparlourmaid she was and I was cook.",
    "You were there when Mr Savage died werent you I beg your\npardon maam.",
    "You were there when Mr Savage died Mr\nTempleton didnt die  at least I havent heard so.",
    "He went abroad.",
    "Not Mr Templeton  Mr Savage said Bobby.",
    "Mrs Pratt looked at him vacantly.",
    "The gentleman who left her all the money said Frankie.",
    "A gleam of something like intelligence passed across Mrs Pratts\nface.",
    "Oh yes maam the gentleman there was the inquest on.",
    "Thats\nright said Frankie delighted with her success.",
    "He used to come\nand stay quite often didnt he I couldnt say as to that maam.",
    "Id\nonly just come you see.",
    "Gladys would know.",
    "But you had to witness his will didnt you\nMrs Pratt looked blank.",
    "You went and saw him sign a paper and you had to sign it too.",
    "Again the gleam of intelligence.",
    "Yes maam.",
    "Me and Albert.",
    "Id never done such a thing before and I\ndidnt like it.",
    "I said to Gladys I dont like signing a paper and thats a\nfact and Gladys she said it must be all right because Mr Elford was\nthere and he was a very nice gentleman as well as being a lawyer.",
    "What happened exactly asked Bobby.",
    "I beg your pardon sir Who called you to sign your name asked\nFrankie.",
    "The mistress sir.",
    "She came into the kitchen and said would I go\noutside and call Albert and would we both come up to the best\nbedroom which shed moved out of for Mr  the gentleman  the\nnight before and there was the gentleman sitting up in bed  hed\ncome back from London and gone straight to bed  and a very illlooking gentleman he was.",
    "I hadnt seen him before.",
    "But he looked\nsomething ghastly and Mr Elford was there too and he spoke very\nnice and said there was nothing to be afraid of and I was to sign my\nname where the gentleman had signed his and I did and put cook\nafter it and the address and Albeit did the same and I went down to\nGladys all of a tremble and said Id never seen a gentleman look so\nlike death and Gladys said hed looked all right the night before\nand that it must have been something in London that had upset him.",
    "Hed gone up to London very early before anyone was up.",
    "And then I said about not liking to write my name to anything and\nGladys said it was all right because Mr Elford was there.",
    "And Mr\nSavage  the gentleman died  when Next morning as ever was\nmaam.",
    "He shut himself up in his room that night and wouldnt let\nanyone go near him and when Gladys called him in the morning he\nwas all stiff and dead and a letter propped up by his bedside.",
    "To\nthe Coroner it said.",
    "Oh it gave Gladys a regular turn.",
    "And then\nthere was an inquest and everything.",
    "About two months later Mrs\nTempleton told me she was going abroad to live.",
    "But she got me a\nvery good place up north with big wages and she gave me a nice\n\n\fpresent and everything.",
    "A very nice lady Mrs Templeton.",
    "Mrs Pratt\nwas by now thoroughly enjoying her own loquacity.",
    "Frankie rose.",
    "Well she said.",
    "Its been very nice to hear all this.",
    "She slipped a\nnote out of her purse.",
    "You must let me leave you a er  little\npresent.",
    "Ive taken up so much of your time.",
    "Well thank you kindly\nIm sure maam.",
    "Good day to you and your good gentleman.",
    "Frankie blushed and retreated rather rapidly.",
    "Bobby followed her\nafter a few minutes.",
    "He looked preoccupied.",
    "Well he said.",
    "We seem to have got at all she knows.",
    "Yes said\nFrankie.",
    "And it hangs together.",
    "There seems no doubt that Savage\ndid make that will and I suppose his fear of cancer was genuine\nenough.",
    "They couldnt very well bribe a Harley Street doctor.",
    "I\nsuppose they just took advantage of his having made that will to do\naway with him quickly before he changed his mind.",
    "But how we or\nanyone else can prove they did make away with him I cant see.",
    "I\nknow.",
    "We may suspect that Mrs T gave him something to make him\nsleep but we cant prove it.",
    "Bassingtonffrench may have forged\nthe letter to the coroner but that again we cant prove by now.",
    "I\nexpect the letter is destroyed long ago after being put in as\nevidence at the inquest.",
    "So we come back to the old problem what on earth are Bassingtonffrench and Co. so afraid of our\ndiscovering Nothing strikes you as odd particularly No I dont\nthink so  at least only one thing.",
    "Why did Mrs Templeton send out\nfor the gardener to come and witness the will when the houseparlourmaid\n\nwas\n\nin\n\nthe\n\nhouse.",
    "Why\n\ndidnt\n\nthey\n\nask\n\nparlourmaid Its odd your saying that Frankie said Bobby.",
    "the\n\n\fHis voice sounded so queer that Frankie looked at him in surprise.",
    "Why Because I stayed behind to ask Mrs Pratt for Gladyss name\nand address.",
    "Well The parlourmaids name was Evans\n\nCHAPTER 32 Evans\n\nFrankie gasped.",
    "Bobbys voice rose excitedly.",
    "You see youve asked the same question that Carstairs asked.",
    "Why\ndidnt they ask the parlourmaid Why didnt they ask Evans Ohi\nBobby were getting there at last The same thing must have\nstruck Carstairs.",
    "He was nosing round just as we were looking for\nsomething fishy  and this point struck him just as it struck us.",
    "And\nmoreover I believe he came to Wales for that reason.",
    "Gladys Evans\nis a Welsh name  Evans was probably a Welsh girl.",
    "He was\nfollowing her to Marchbolt.",
    "And someone was following him  and\nso he never got to her.",
    "Why didnt they ask Evans said Frankie.",
    "There must be a reason.",
    "Its such a silly little point  and yet its\nimportant.",
    "With a couple of maids in the house why send out for a\ngardener Perhaps because both Chudleigh and Albert Mere were\nchumps whereas Evans was rather a sharp girl.",
    "It cant be only\nthat.",
    "Mr Elford was there and hes quite shrewd.",
    "Oh Bobby the\nwhole situation is there  I know it is.",
    "If we could just get at the reason.",
    "Evans.",
    "Why Chudleigh and Mere\nand not Evans Suddenly she stopped and put both hands over her\neyes.",
    "Its coming she said.",
    "Just a sort of flicker.",
    "Itll come in a minute.",
    "She stayed dead still for a minute or two then removed her hands\nand looked at her companion with an odd flicker in her eyes.",
    "Bobby she said if youre staying in a house with two servants\nwhich do you tip The houseparlourmaid of course said Bobby\nsurprised.",
    "One never tips a cook.",
    "One never sees her for one thing.",
    "No and\nshe never sees you.",
    "At least she might catch a glimpse of you if you\nwere there some rime.",
    "But a houseparlourmaid waits on you at\ndinner and calls you and hands you coffee.",
    "What are you getting\nat Frankie They couldnt have Evans witnessing that will because Evans would have known that it wasnt Mr Savage who\nwas making it Good Lord Frankie what do you mean Who was it\nthen\n\nBassingtonffrench\n\nof\n\ncourse\n\nDont\n\nyou\n\nsee\n\nhe\n\nimpersonated Savage I bet it was Bassingtonffrench who went to\nthat doctor and made all that fuss about having cancer.",
    "Then the\nlawyer is sent for  a stranger who doesnt know Mr Savage but who\nwill be able to swear that he saw Mr Savage sign that will and its\nwitnessed by two people one of whom hadnt seen him before and\nthe other an old man who was probably pretty blind and who\nprobably had never seen Savage either.",
    "Now do you see But\nwhere was the real Savage all that time Oh he arrived all right\nand then I suspect they drugged him and put him in the attic\n\n\fperhaps and kept him there for twelve hours while Bassingtonffrench did his impersonation stunt.",
    "Then he was put back in his bed and given chloral and Evans finds\nhim dead in the morning.",
    "My God I believe youve hit it Frankie.",
    "But can we prove it Yes  no  I dont know.",
    "Supposing Rose\nChudleigh  Pratt I mean  was shown a photograph of the real\nSavage Would she be able to say that wasnt the man who signed\nthe will I doubt it said Bobby.",
    "She is such a nitwit.",
    "Chosen for\nthat purpose I expect.",
    "But theres another thing.",
    "An expert ought to\nbe able to detect that the signature is a forgery.",
    "They didnt\nbefore.",
    "Because nobody ever raised the question.",
    "There didnt\nseem any possible moment when the will could have been forged.",
    "But now its different.",
    "One thing we must do said Bobby.",
    "Find\nEvans.",
    "She may be able to tell us a lot.",
    "She was with the\nTempletons for six months remember Frankie groaned.",
    "Thats going to make it even more difficult.",
    "How about the post\noffice suggested Bobby.",
    "They were just passing it.",
    "In appearance it was more of a general\nstore than a post office.",
    "Frankie darted inside and opened the campaign.",
    "There was no one\nelse in the shop except the postmistress  a young woman with an\ninquisitive nose.",
    "Frankie bought a twoshilling book of stamps commented on the\nweather and then said But I expect you always have better\nweather here than we do in my part of the world.",
    "I live in Wales \n\n\fMarchbolt.",
    "You wouldnt believe the rain we have.",
    "The young\nwoman with the nose said that they had a good deal of rain\nthemselves and last Bank Holiday it had rained something cruel.",
    "Frankie said Theres someone in Marchbolt who comes from this\npart of the world.",
    "I wonder if you know her.",
    "Her name was Evans Gladys Evans.",
    "The young woman was quite unsuspicious.",
    "Why of course she said.",
    "She was in service here.",
    "At Tudor\nCottage.",
    "But she didnt come from these parts.",
    "She came from\nWales and she went back there and married  Roberts her name is\nnow.",
    "Thats right said Frankie.",
    "You cant give me her address I\nsuppose I borrowed a raincoat from her and forgot to give it back.",
    "If I had her address Id post it to her.",
    "Well now the other replied I\nbelieve I can.",
    "I get a p.c.",
    "from her now and again.",
    "She and her\nhusband have gone into service together.",
    "Wait a minute now.",
    "She\nwent away and rummaged in a corner.",
    "Presently she returned with\na piece of paper in her hand.",
    "Here you are she said pushing it across the counter.",
    "Bobby and Frankie read it together.",
    "It was the last thing in the\nworld they expected.",
    "Mrs Roberts The Vicarage Marchbolt Wales.",
    "CHAPTER 33 Sensation in the Orient Cafe\n\nHow Bobby and Frankie got out of the post office without\ndisgracing themselves neither of them ever knew.",
    "Outside with one accord they looked at each other and shook with\nlaugher.",
    "At the Vicarage  all the time gasped Bobby.",
    "And I looked through four hundred and eighty Evans lamented\nFrankie.",
    "Now I see why Bassingtonffrench was so amused when he\nrealized we didnt know in the least who Evans was And of course\nit was dangerous from their point of view.",
    "You and Evans were actually under the same roof.",
    "Come on said\nBobby.",
    "Marchbolts the next place.",
    "Like where the rainbow ends\nsaid Frankie.",
    "Back to the dear old home.",
    "Dash it all said Bobby\nwe must do something about Badger.",
    "Have you any money\nFrankie Frankie opened her bag and took out a handful of notes.",
    "Give these to him and tell him to make some arrangement with his\ncreditors and that Father will buy the garage and put him in as\nmanager.",
    "All right said Bobby.",
    "The great thing is to get off\nquickly.",
    "Why this frightful haste I dont know  but Ive a feeling\nsomething might happen.",
    "How awful.",
    "Lets go ever so quickly.",
    "Ill\nsettle Badger.",
    "You go and start the car.",
    "I shall never buy that\ntoothbrush said Frankie.",
    "Five minutes saw them speeding out of Chipping Somerton.",
    "Bobby had no occasion to complain of lack of speed.",
    "Nevertheless Frankie suddenly said Look here Bobby this isnt\nquick enough.",
    "Bobby glanced at the speedometer needle which\nwas at the moment registering eighty and remarked dryly I dont\nsee what more we can do.",
    "We can take an air taxi said Frankie.",
    "Were only about seven miles from Medeshot Aerodrome.",
    "My dear\ngirl said Bobby.",
    "If we do that well be home in a couple of hours.",
    "Good said\nBobby.",
    "Lets take an air taxi.",
    "The whole proceedings were\nbeginning to take on the fantastic character of a dream.",
    "Why this\nwild hurry to get to Marchbolt Bobby didnt know.",
    "He suspected\nthat Frankie didnt know either.",
    "It was just a feeling.",
    "At Medeshot Frankie asked for Mr Donald King and an untidylooking young man was produced who appeared languidly\nsurprised at the sight of her.",
    "Hullo Frankie he said.",
    "I havent seen you for an age.",
    "What do you want I want an air taxi said Frankie.",
    "You do that\nsort of thing dont you Oh yes.",
    "Where do you want to go I want\nto get home quickly said Frankie.",
    "Mr Donald King raised his eyebrows.",
    "Is that all he asked.",
    "Not quite said Frankie.",
    "But its the main idea.",
    "Oh well we can\nsoon fix you up.",
    "Ill give you a cheque said Frankie.",
    "Five minutes later they were off.",
    "Frankie said Bobby.",
    "Why are we doing this I havent the faintest\nidea said Frankie.",
    "But I feel we must.",
    "Dont you Curiously enough I do.",
    "But I dont know why.",
    "After all\nour Mrs Roberts wont fly away on a broomstick.",
    "She might.",
    "Remember we dont know what Bassingtonffrench is up to.",
    "Thats\ntrue said Bobby thoughtfully.",
    "It was growing late when they reached their destination.",
    "The plane\nlanded them in the Park and five minutes later Bobby and Frankie\nwere driving into Marchbolt in Lord Marchingtons Chrysler.",
    "They pulled up outside the Vicarage gate the Vicarage drive not\nlending itself to the turning of expensive cars.",
    "Then jumping out they ran up the drive.",
    "I shall wake up soon thought Bobby.",
    "What are we doing and\nwhy A slender figure was standing on the doorstep.",
    "Frankie and\nBobby recognized her at the same minute.",
    "Moira cried Frankie.",
    "Moira turned.",
    "She was swaying slightly.",
    "Oh Im so glad to see you.",
    "I dont know what to do.",
    "But what on\nearth brings you here The same thing that has brought you I\nexpect.",
    "You have found out who Evans is asked Bobby.",
    "Moira nodded.",
    "Yes its a long story  Come inside said Bobby.",
    "But Moira shrank back.",
    "No no she said hurriedly.",
    "Lets go somewhere and talk.",
    "Theres something I must tell you  before we go into the house.",
    "Isnt\nthere a cafe or some place like that in the town\n\nSomewhere where we could go All right said Bobby moving\nunwillingly away from the door.",
    "But why  Moira stamped her foot.",
    "Youll see when I tell you.",
    "Oh do come.",
    "Theres not a minute to\nlose.",
    "They yielded to her urgency.",
    "About halfway down the main\nstreet was the Orient Cafe  a somewhat grand name not borne out\nby the interior decoration.",
    "The three of them filed in.",
    "It was a slack\nmoment  halfpast six.",
    "They sat down at a small table in the corner and Bobby ordered\nthree coffees.",
    "Now then he said.",
    "Wait till shes brought the coffee said Moira.",
    "The waitress returned and listlessly deposited three cups of tepid\ncoffee in front of them.",
    "Now then said Bobby.",
    "I hardly know where to begin said Moira.",
    "It was in the train going\nto London.",
    "Really the most amazing coincidence.",
    "I went along the corridor and  She broke off.",
    "Her seat faced the\ndoor and she leant forward staring.",
    "He must have followed me she said.",
    "Who cried Frankie and Bobby together.",
    "Bassingtonffrench whispered Moira.",
    "Youve seen him Hes outside.",
    "I saw him with a woman with red\nhair.",
    "Mrs Cayman cried Frankie.",
    "She and Bobby jumped and ran to the door.",
    "A protest came from\nMoira but neither of them heeded it.",
    "They looked up and down the\nstreet but Bassingtonffrench was nowhere in sight.",
    "Moira joined them.",
    "Has he gone she asked her voice trembling.",
    "Oh do be careful.",
    "Hes dangerous  horribly dangerous.",
    "He cant do anything so long\nas were all together said Bobby.",
    "Brace up Moira said Frankie.",
    "Dont be such a rabbit.",
    "Well we\ncant do anything for the moment said Bobby leading the way\nback to the table.",
    "Go on with what you were telling us Moira.",
    "He\npicked up his cup of coffee.",
    "Frankie lost her balance and fell\nagainst him and the coffee poured over the table.",
    "Sorry said Frankie.",
    "She stretched over the adjoining table which was laid for possible\ndiners.",
    "There was a cruet on it with two glass stoppered bottles\ncontaining oil and vinegar.",
    "The oddity of Frankies proceedings riveted Bobbys attention.",
    "She took the vinegar bottle emptied out the vinegar into the slop\nbowl and began to pour coffee into it from her cup.",
    "Have you gone batty Frankie asked Bobby.",
    "What the devil are\nyou doing Taking a sample of this coffee for George Arbuthnot to\nanalyse said Frankie.",
    "She turned to Moira.",
    "The games up Moira The whole thing came to me in a flash as we\nstood at the door just now When I jogged Bobbys elbow and made\nhim spill his coffee I saw your face.",
    "You put something in our cups\nwhen you sent us running to the door to look for Bassingtonffrench.",
    "The games up Mrs Nicholson or Templeton or whatever\nyou like to call yourself.",
    "Templeton cried Bobby.",
    "Look at her face cried Frankie.",
    "If she denies it ask her to come to\nthe Vicarage and see if Mrs Roberts doesnt identify her.",
    "Bobby did\nlook at her.",
    "He saw that face that haunting wistful face\ntransformed by a demoniac rage.",
    "That beautiful mouth opened and\na stream of foul and hideous curses poured out.",
    "She fumbled in her handbag.",
    "Bobby was still dazed but he acted in the nick of time.",
    "It was his hand that struck the pistol up.",
    "The bullet passed over Frankies head and buried itself in the wall of\nthe Orient Cafe.",
    "For the first time in its history one of the waitresses hurried.",
    "With a wild scream she shot out into the street calling Help\n\nMurder Police\n\nCHAPTER 34 Letter from South America\n\nIt was some weeks later.",
    "Frankie had just received a letter.",
    "It bore the stamp of one of the\nless wellknown South American republics.",
    "After reading it through she passed it to Bobby.",
    "It ran as follows Dear Frankie Really I congratulate you You and\nyour young naval friend have shattered the plans of a lifetime.",
    "I had\neverything so nicely arranged.",
    "Would you really like to hear all about it My lady friend has given\nme away so thoroughly spite Im afraid  women are invariable\nspiteful that my most damaging admissions wont do me any\nfurther harm.",
    "Besides I am starting life again.",
    "Roger Bassingtonffrench is dead.",
    "I fancy Ive always been what they call a wrong un.",
    "Even at Oxford\nI had a little lapse.",
    "Stupid because it was bound to be found out.",

    "She and I liked each other.",
    "We decided to make a match of it but\nwed a few plans to carry through first.",
    "To begin with she married Nicholson.",
    "By doing so she removed\nherself to another world and the police lost sight of her.",
    "Nicholson\nwas just coming over to England to start a place for nerve patients.",
    "He was looking for a suitable house to buy cheap.",
    "Moira got him on\nto the Grange.",
    "She was still working in with her gang in the dope business.",

    "A Bassingtonffrench played a great part in the reign of Charles II.",

    "But I had to have money.",
    "Moira made several trips across to Canada to see her people.",
    "Nicholson adored her and believed anything she told him.",
    "Most men\ndid.",
    "Owing to the complications of the drug business she travelled\nunder various names.",
    "She was travelling as Mrs Templeton when\nshe met Savage.",
    "She knew all about Savage and his enormous\nwealth and she went all out for him.",
    "He was attracted but he wasn\nt attracted enough to lose his common sense.",
    "However we concocted a plan.",
    "You know pretty well the story of\nthat.",
    "The man you know as Cayman acted the part of the unfeeling\nhusband.",
    "Savage was induced to come down and stay at Tudor\nCottage more than once.",
    "The third time he came our plans were\nlaid.",
    "I neednt go into all that you know it.",
    "The whole thing went\nwith a bang.",
    "Moira cleared the money and went of if ostensibly\nabroad  in reality back to Staverley and the Grange.",
    "In the meantime I was perfecting my own plans.",
    "Henry and young\nTommy had to be got out of the way.",
    "I had bad luck over Tommy.",
    "A\ncouple of perfectly good accidents went wrong.",
    "I wasnt going to\nfool about with accidents in Henrys case.",
    "He had a good deal of\nrheumatic pain after an accident in the hunting field.",
    "I introduced\nhim to morphia.",
    "He took it in all good faith.",
    "Henry was a simple soul.",
    "He soon became an addict.",
    "Our plan was that he should go to the\nGrange for treatment and should there either commit suicide or\nget hold of an overdose of morphia.",
    "Moira would do the business.",
    "I\nshouldn t be connected with it in any way.",
    "And then that fool Car stairs began to be active.",
    "It seems that\nSavage had written him a line on board ship mentioning Mrs\nTempleton and even enclosing a snapshot of her.",
    "Carstairs went on\na shooting trip soon afterwards.",
    "When he came back from the wilds\nand heard the news of Savages death and will he was frankly\nincredulous.",
    "The story didn t ring true to him.",
    "He was certain that\nSavage wasnt worried about his death and he didnt believe he had\nany special fear of cancer.",
    "Also the wording of the will sounded to\nhim highly uncharacteristic.",
    "Savage was a hardheaded business\nman and while he might be quite ready to have an affair with a\npretty woman Carstairs didnt believe he would leave a vast sum of\nmoney to her and the rest to charity.",
    "The charity touch was my\nidea.",
    "It sounded so respectable and unfishy.",
    "Carstairs came over here determined to look into the business.",
    "He began to poke about.",
    "And straightaway we had a piece of bad luck.",
    "Some friends brought\nhim down to lunch and he saw a picture of Moira on the piano and\nrecognized it as the woman of the snapshot that Savage had sent\nhim.",
    "He went down to Chipping Somerton and started to poke about\nthere.",
    "Moira and I began to get the wind up  I sometimes think\nunnecessarily.",
    "But Carstairs was a shrewd chap.",
    "I went down to Chipping Somerton after him.",
    "He failed to trace the\ncook  Rose Chudleigh.",
    "Shed gone to the north but he tracked\ndown Evans found out her married name and started of if for\nMarchbolt.",
    "Things were getting serious.",
    "If Evans identified Mrs Templeton and\nMrs Nicholson as one and the same person matters were going to\nbecome difficult.",
    "Also she d been in the house some time and we\nweren t sure quite how much she might know.",
    "I decided that Carstairs had got to be suppressed.",
    "He was making a\nserious nuisance of himself.",
    "Chance came to my aid.",
    "I was close\nbehind him when the mist came up.",
    "I crept up nearer and a sudden\npush did the job.",
    "But I was still in a dilemma.",
    "I didnt know what incriminating matter\nhe might have on him.",
    "However your young naval friend played into\nmy hands very nicely.",
    "I was left alone with the body for a short time\n quite enough for my purpose.",
    "He had a photograph of Moira  hed\ngot it from the photographers  presumably for identification.",
    "I\n\n\fremoved that and any letters or identifying matter.",
    "Then I planted\nthe photograph of one of the gang.",
    "All went well.",
    "The pseudo sister and brotherinlaw came down and\nidentified him.",
    "All seemed to have gone off satisfactorily.",
    "And then\nyour friend Bobby upset things.",
    "It seemed that Carstairs had\nrecovered consciousness before he died and that he had been\nsaying things.",
    "He d mentioned Evans  and Evans was actually in\nservice at the Vicarage.",
    "I admit we were getting rattled by now.",
    "We lost our heads a bit.",
    "Moira insisted that he must be put out of the way.",
    "We tried one plan\nwhich failed.",
    "Then Moira said she d see to it.",
    "She went down to\nMarchbolt in the car.",
    "She seized a chance very neatly  slipped\nsome morphia into his beer when he was asleep.",
    "But the young\ndevil didnt succumb.",
    "That was pure bad luck.",
    "As I told you it was Nicholson s crossquestioning that made me\nwonder if you were just what you seemed.",
    "But imagine the shock\nthat Moira had when she was creeping out to meet me one evening\nand came face to face with Bobby She recognized him at once she\nd had a good look when he was asleep that day.",
    "No wonder she\nwas so scared she nearly passed out.",
    "Then she realized that it\nwasnt her he suspected and she rallied and played up.",
    "She came to the inn and told him a few tall stories.",
    "He swallowed\nthem like a lamb.",
    "She pretended that Alan Carstairs was an old\nlover and she piled it on thick about her fear of Nicholson.",
    "Also she\ndid her best to disabuse you of your suspicions concerning me.",
    "I\n\n\fdid the same to you and disparaged her as a weak helpless\ncreature  Moira who had the nerve to put any number of people\nout of the way without turning a hair\n\nThe position was serious.",
    "Wed got the money.",
    "We were getting on\nwell with the Henry plan.",
    "I was in no hurry for Tommy.",
    "I could afford\nto wait a bit.",
    "Nicholson could easily be got out of the way when the\ntime came.",
    "But you and Bobby were a menace.",
    "Youd got your\nsuspicions fixed on the Grange.",
    "It may interest you to know that Henry didnt commit suicide.",
    "I killed him When I was talking to you in the garden I saw there was\nno time to waste  and I went straight in and saw to things.",
    "The aeroplane that came over gave me my chance.",
    "I went into the\nstudy sat down by Henry who was writing and said Look here old\nman  and shot him The noise of the plane drowned the sound.",
    "Then I wrote a nice affecting letter wiped off my fingerprints from\nthe revolver pressed Henrys hand round it and let it drop to the\nfloor.",
    "I put the key of the study in Henrys pocket and went out\nlocking the door from the outside with the diningroom key which fits\nthe lock.",
    "I wont go into details of the neat little squib arrangement in the\nchimney which was timed to go off four minutes later.",
    "Everything went beautifully.",
    "You and I were in the garden together\nand heard the shot.",
    "A perfect suicide The only person who laid\n\n\fhimself open to suspicion was poor old Nicholson.",
    "The ass came\nback for a stick or something\n\nOf course Bobbys knight errantry was a bit difficult for Moira.",
    "So she just went off to the cottage.",
    "We fancied that Nicholsons\nexplanation of his wifes absence would be sure to make you\nsuspicious.",
    "Where Moira really showed her mettle was at the cottage.",
    "She\nrealized from the noise upstairs that Id been knocked out and she\nquickly injected a large dose of morphia into herself and lay down\non the bed.",
    "After you all went down to telephone she nipped up to\nthe attic and cut me free.",
    "Then the morphia took effect and by the\ntime the doctor arrived she was genuinely off in a hypnotic sleep.",
    "But all the same her nerve was going.",
    "She was afraid youd get on\nto Evans and get the hang of how Savages will and suicide was\nworked.",
    "Also she was afraid that Carstairs had written to Evans\nbefore he came to Marchbolt.",
    "She pretended to go up to a London\nnursing home.",
    "Instead she hurried down to Marchbolt  and met\nyou on the doorstep Then her one idea was to get you both out of\nthe way.",
    "Her methods were crude to the last degree but I believe\nshe d have got away with it.",
    "I doubt if the waitress would have been\nable to remember much about what the woman who came in with\nyou was like.",
    "Moira would have got away back to London and lain\nlow in a nursing home.",
    "With you and Bobby out of the way the whole\nthing would have died down.",
    "But you spotted her  and she lost her head.",
    "And then at the trial\nshe dragged me into it\n\nPerhaps I was getting a little tired of her.",
    "But I had no idea that she knew it.",
    "You see she had got the money  my money Once I had married\nher I might have got tired of her.",
    "I like variety.",
    "So here I am starting life again.",
    "And all owing to you and that extremely objectionable young man\nBobby Jones.",
    "But Ive no doubt I shall make good\n\nOr ought it to be bad not good\n\nI havent reformed yet.",
    "But if at first you dont succeed try try try again.",
    "Goodbye my dear  or perhaps au revoir.",
    "One never knows does\none\n\nYour affectionate enemy the bold bad villain of the piece Roger\nBassingtonffrench.",
    "CHAPTER 35 News from the Vicarage\n\n\fBobby handed back the letter and with a sigh Frankie took it.",
    "Hes really a very remarkable person she said.",
    "You always had a fancy for him said Bobby coldly.",
    "He had charm said Frankie.",
    "So had Moira she added.",
    "Bobby blushed.",
    "It was very queer that all the time the clue to the whole thing should\nhave been in the Vicarage he said.",
    "You do know dont you\nFrankie that Carstairs had actually written to Evans  to Mrs\nRoberts that is Frankie nodded.",
    "Telling her that he was coming to see her and that he wanted\ninformation about Mrs Templeton whom he had reason to believe\nwas a dangerous international crook wanted by the police.",
    "And then when hes pushed over the cliff she doesnt put two and\ntwo together said Bobby bitterly.",
    "Thats because the man who went over the cliff was Pritchard said\nFrankie.",
    "That identification was a very clever bit of work.",
    "If a man\ncalled Pritchard is pushed over how could it be a man called\nCarstairs Thats how the ordinary mind works.",
    "The funny thing is\nthat she recognized Cayman went on Bobby.",
    "At least she caught a\nglimpse of him when Roberts was letting him in and asked him who\nit was.",
    "And he said it was Mr Cayman and she said Funny hes the\n\n\fdead spit of a gentleman I used to be in service with.",
    "Can you\nbeat it said Frankie.",
    "Even Bassingtonffrench gave himself away once or twice she\ncontinued.",
    "But like an idiot I never spotted it.",
