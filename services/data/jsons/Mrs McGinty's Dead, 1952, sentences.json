    "MRS McGINTY\u2019S DEAD\n\nAgatha Christie\n\n\fChapter 1\n\nHercule Poirot came out of the Vielle Grandm\u00e8re restaurant into\nSoho.",
    "He turned up the collar of his overcoat through prudence\nrather than necessity since the night was not cold.",
    "But at my age\none takes no risks Poirot was wont to declare.",
    "His eyes held a reflective sleepy pleasure.",
    "The escargots de la\nVielle Grandm\u00e8re had been delicious.",
    "A real find this dingy little\nrestaurant.",
    "Meditatively like a wellfed dog Hercule Poirot curled\nhis tongue round his lips.",
    "Drawing his handkerchief from his\npocket he dabbed his luxuriant moustaches.",
    "Yes he had dined well... And now what\n\nA taxi passing him slowed down invitingly.",
    "Poirot hesitated for a\nmoment but made no sign.",
    "Why take a taxi He would in any case\nreach home too early to go to bed.",
    "Alas murmured Poirot to his moustaches that one can only eat\nthree times a day...\n\nFor afternoon tea was a meal to which he had never become\nacclimatised.",
    "If one partakes of the five oclock one does not he\nexplained approach the dinner with the proper quality of\n\n\fexpectant gastric juices.",
    "And the dinner let us remember is the\nsupreme meal of the day\n\nNot for him either the midmorning coffee.",
    "No chocolate and\ncroissants for breakfast D\u00e9jeneur at twelvethirty if possible but\ncertainly not later than one oclock and finally the climax Le\nDiner\n\nThese were the peak periods of Hercule Poirots day.",
    "Always a\nman who had taken his stomach seriously he was reaping his\nreward in old age.",
    "Eating was now not only a physical pleasure it\nwas also an intellectual research.",
    "For in between meals he spent\nquite a lot of time searching out and marking down possible\nsources of new and delicious food.",
    "La Vielle Grandm\u00e9re was the\nresult of one of these quests and La Vielle Grandm\u00e9re had just\nreceived the seal of Hercule Poirots gastronomic approval.",
    "But now unfortunately there was the evening to put in.",
    "Hercule Poirot sighed.",
    "If only he thought ce cher Hastings were available...",
    "He dwelt with pleasure on his remembrances of his old friend.",
    "My first friend in this country  and still to me the dearest friend I\nhave.",
    "True often and often did he enrage me.",
    "But do I remember\nthat now No.",
    "I remember only his incredulous wonder his openmouthed appreciation of my talents  the ease with which I misled\nhim without uttering an untrue word his bafflement his\n\n\fstupendous astonishment when he at last perceived the truth that\nhad been clear to me all along.",
    "Ce cher cher ami It is my\nweakness it has always been my weakness to desire to show off.",
    "That weakness Hastings could never understand.",
    "But indeed it is\nvery necessary for a man of my abilities to admire himself  and for\nthat one needs stimulation from outside.",
    "I cannot truly I cannot sit\nin a chair all day reflecting how truly admirable I am.",
    "One needs\nthe human touch.",
    "One needs  as they say nowadays  the stooge.",
    "Hercule Poirot sighed.",
    "He turned into Shaftesbury Avenue.",
    "Should he cross it and go on to Leicester Square and spend the\nevening at a cinema Frowning slightly he shook his head.",
    "The\ncinema more often than not enraged him by the looseness of its\nplots  the lack of logical continuity in the argument  even the\nphotography which raved over by some to Hercule Poirot seemed\noften no more than the portrayal of scenes and objects so as to\nmake them appear totally different from what they were in reality.",
    "Everything Hercule Poirot decided was too artistic nowadays.",
    "Nowhere was there the love of order and method that he himself\nprized so highly.",
    "And seldom was there any appreciation of\nsubtlety.",
    "Scenes of violence and crude brutality were the fashion\nand as a former police officer Poirot was bored by brutality.",
    "In his\nearly days he had seen plenty of crude brutality.",
    "It had been more\nthe rule than the exception.",
    "He found it fatiguing and unintelligent.",
    "The truth is Poirot reflected as he turned his steps homeward I\nam not in tune with the modern world.",
    "And I am in a superior way\na slave as other men are slaves.",
    "My work has enslaved me just as\n\n\ftheir work enslaves them.",
    "When the hour of leisure arrives they\nhave nothing with which to fill their leisure.",
    "The retired financier\ntakes up golf the little merchant puts bulbs in his garden me I\neat.",
    "But there it is I come round to it again.",
    "One can only eat three\ntime a day.",
    "And in between are the gaps.",
    "He passed a newspaperseller and scanned the bill.",
    "Result of McGinty Trial.",
    "Verdict.",
    "It stirred no interest in him.",
    "He recalled vaguely a small paragraph\nin the papers.",
    "It had not been an interesting murder.",
    "Some\nwretched old woman knocked on the head for a few pounds.",
    "All\npart of the senseless crude brutality of these days.",
    "Poirot turned into the courtyard of his block of flats.",
    "As always his\nheart swelled in approval.",
    "He was proud of his home.",
    "A splendid\nsymmetrical building.",
    "The lift took him up to the third floor where\nhe had a large luxury flat with impeccable chromium fittings\nsquare armchairs and severely rectangular ornaments.",
    "There\ncould truly be said not to be a curve in the place.",
    "As he opened the door with his latchkey and stepped into the\nsquare white lobby his manservant George stepped softly to\nmeet him.",
    "Good evening sir.",
    "There is a  gentleman waiting to see you.",
    "He relieved Poirot deftly of his overcoat.",
    "Indeed Poirot was aware of that very slight pause before the\nword gentleman.",
    "As a social snob George was an expert.",
    "A Mr Spence sir.",
    "Spence.",
    "The name for the moment meant nothing to Poirot.",
    "Yet\nhe knew that it should do so.",
    "Pausing for a moment before the mirror to adjust his moustaches\nto a state of perfection Poirot opened the door of the sittingroom\nand entered.",
    "The man sitting in one of the big square armchairs\ngot up.",
    "Hullo M. Poirot hope you remember me.",
    "Its a long time...",
    "Superintendent Spence.",
    "But of course.",
    "Poirot shook him warmly by the hand.",
    "Superintendent\n\nSpence\n\nof\n\nthe\n\nColchester\n\nPolice.",
    "A\n\nvery\n\ninteresting case that had been... As Spence had said a long time\nago now...\n\nPoirot pressed his guest with refreshments.",
    "A grenadine Cr\u00e8me\nde Menthe Benedictine Cr\u00e8me de Cacao...\n\nAt this moment George entered with a tray on which was a whisky\nbottle and a siphon.",
    "Or beer if you prefer it sir he murmured to\nthe visitor.",
    "Superintendent Spences large red face lightened.",
    "Beer for me he said.",
    "Poirot was left to wonder once more at the accomplishments of\nGeorge.",
    "He himself had had no idea that there was beer in the flat\nand it seemed incomprehensible to him that it could be preferred\nto a sweet liqueur.",
    "When Spence had his foaming tankard Poirot poured himself out a\ntiny glass of gleaming green cr\u00e8me de menthe.",
    "But it is charming of you to look me up he said.",
    "Charming.",
    "You\nhave come up from\n\nKilchester.",
    "Ill be retired in about six months.",
    "Actually I was due\nfor retirement eighteen months ago.",
    "They asked me to stop on and\nI did.",
    "You were wise said Poirot with feeling.",
    "You were very wise...\n\nWas I I wonder.",
    "Im not so sure.",
    "Yes yes you were wise Poirot insisted.",
    "The long hours of\nennui you have no conception of them.",
    "Oh Ill have plenty to do when I retire.",
    "Moved into a new house\nlast year we did.",
    "Quite a bit of garden and shamefully neglected.",
    "I\nhavent been able to get down to it properly yet.",
    "Ah yes you are one of those who garden.",
    "Me once I decided to\nlive in the country and grow vegetable marrows.",
    "It did not\nsucceed.",
    "I have not the temperament.",
    "You should have seen one of my marrows last year said Spence\nwith enthusiasm.",
    "Colossal And my roses.",
    "Im keen on roses.",
    "Im\ngoing to have \n\nHe broke off.",
    "Thats not what I came to talk about.",
    "No no you came to see an old acquaintance  it was kind.",
    "I\nappreciate it.",
    "Theres more to it than that Im afraid M. Poirot.",
    "Ill be honest.",
    "I\nwant something.",
    "Poirot murmured delicately\n\nThere is a mortgage possibly on your house You would like a\nloan \n\nSpence interrupted in a horrified voice\n\nOh good lord its not money Nothing of that kind.",
    "Poirot waved his hands in graceful apology.",
    "I demand your pardon.",
    "Ill tell you straight out  its damned cheek what Ive come for.",
    "If\nyou send me away with a flea in my ear I shant be surprised.",
    "There will be no flea said Poirot.",
    "But continue.",
    "Its the McGinty case.",
    "Youve read about it perhaps\n\nPoirot shook his head.",
    "Not with attention.",
    "Mrs McGinty  an old woman in a shop or a\nhouse.",
    "She is dead yes.",
    "How did she die\n\nSpence stared at him.",
    "Lord he said.",
    "That takes me back.",
    "Extraordinary... And I never\nthought of it until now.",
    "I beg your pardon\n\nNothing.",
    "Just a game.",
    "Childs game.",
    "We used to play it when we\nwere kids.",
    "A lot of us in a row.",
    "Question and answer all down the\nline.",
    "Mrs McGintys dead How did she die Down on one knee\njust like I.",
    "And then the next question Mrs McGintys dead.",
    "How\ndid she die Holding her hand out just like I.",
    "And there wed be\nall kneeling and our right arms held out stiff.",
    "And then you got it\nMrs McGintys dead.",
    "How did she die Like THIS Smack the top\nof the row would fall sideways and down we all went like a pack of\nninepins Spence laughed uproariously at the remembrance.",
    "Takes me back it does\n\n\fPoirot waited politely.",
    "This was one of the moments when even\nafter half a lifetime in the country he found the English\nincomprehensible.",
    "He himself had played at Cache Cache and Le\nBoulanger in his childhood but he felt no desire to talk about it or\neven to think about it.",
    "When Spence had overcome his own amusement Poirot repeated\nwith some slight weariness How did she die\n\nThe laughter was wiped off Spences face.",
    "He was suddenly\nhimself again.",
    "She was hit on the back of her head with some sharp heavy\nimplement.",
    "Her savings about thirty pounds in cash were taken\nafter her room had been ransacked.",
    "She lived alone in a small\ncottage except for a lodger.",
    "Man of the name of Bentley.",
    "James\nBentley.",
    "Ah yes Bentley.",
    "The place wasnt broken into.",
    "No signs of any tampering with the\nwindows or locks.",
    "Bentley was hard up had lost his job and owed\ntwo months rent.",
    "The money was found hidden under a loose\nstone at the back of the cottage.",
    "Bentleys coat sleeve had blood\non it and hair  same blood group and the right hair.",
    "According to\nhis first statement he was never near the body  so it couldnt have\ncome there by accident.",
    "Who found her\n\n\fThe baker called with bread.",
    "It was the day he got paid.",
    "James\nBentley opened the door to him and said hed knocked at Mrs\nMcGintys bedroom door but couldnt get an answer.",
    "The baker\nsuggested she might have been taken bad.",
    "They got the woman\nfrom next door to go up and see.",
    "Mrs McGinty wasnt in the\nbedroom and hadnt slept in the bed but the room had been\nransacked and the floorboards had been prised up.",
    "Then they\nthought of looking in the parlour.",
    "She was there lying on the floor\nand the neighbour fairly screamed her head off.",
    "Then they got the\npolice of course.",
    "And Bentley was eventually arrested and tried\n\nYes.",
    "The case came on at the Assizes.",
    "Yesterday.",
    "Open and shut\ncase.",
    "The jury were only out twenty minutes this morning.",
    "Verdict\nGuilty.",
    "Condemned to death.",
    "Poirot nodded.",
    "And then after the verdict you got in a train and came to London\nand came here to see me.",
    "Why\n\nSuperintendent Spence was looking into his beer glass.",
    "He ran his\nfinger slowly round and round the rim.",
    "Because he said I dont think he did it...\n\nChapter 2\n\n\fThere was a moment or two of silence.",
    "You came to me \n\nPoirot did not finish the sentence.",
    "Superintendent Spence looked up.",
    "The colour in his face was\ndeeper than it had been.",
    "It was a typical country mans face\nunexpressive selfcontained with shrewd but honest eyes.",
    "It was\nthe face of a man with definite standards who would never be\nbothered by doubts of himself or by doubts of what constituted\nright and wrong.",
    "Ive been a long time in the Force he said.",
    "Ive had a good deal\nof experience of this that and the other.",
    "I can judge a man as well\nas any other could do.",
    "Ive had cases of murder during my service some of them straightforward enough some of them not so\nstraightforward.",
    "One case you know of M. Poirot \n\nPoirot nodded.",
    "Tricky that was.",
    "But for you we mightnt have seen clear.",
    "But we\ndid see clear  and there wasnt any doubt.",
    "The same with the\nothers you dont know about.",
    "There was Whistler he got his  and\ndeserved it.",
    "There were those chaps who shot old Guterman.",
    "Thee\nwas Verall and his arsenic.",
    "Tranter got off  but he did it all right.",
    "Mrs Courtland  she was lucky  her husband was a nasty\nperverted bit of work and the jury acquitted her accordingly.",
    "Not\n\n\fjustice  just sentiment.",
    "Youve to allow for that happening now and\nagain.",
    "Sometimes there isnt enough evidence sometimes theres\nsentiment sometimes a murderer manages to put it across the\njury  that last doesnt happen often but it can happen.",
    "Sometimes\nits a clever bit of work by defending counsel  or a prosecuting\ncounsel takes the wrong tack.",
    "Oh yes Ive seen a lot of things like\nthat.",
    "But  but...\n\nSpence wagged a hearty forefinger.",
    "I havent seen  not in my experience  an innocent man hanged\nfor something he didnt do.",
    "Its a thing M. Poirot that I dont want\nto see.",
    "Not added Spence in this country\n\nPoirot gazed back at him.",
    "And you think you are going to see it now.",
    "But why \n\nSpence interrupted him.",
    "I know some of the things youre going to say.",
    "Ill answer them\nwithout you having to ask them.",
    "I was put on this case.",
    "I was put on\nto get evidence of what happened.",
    "I went into the whole business\nvery carefully.",
    "I got the facts all the facts I could.",
    "All those facts\npointed one way  pointed to one person.",
    "When Id got all the facts I\ntook them to my superior officer.",
    "After that it was out of my hands.",
    "The case went to the Public Prosecutor and it was up to him.",
    "He\ndecided to prosecute  he couldnt have done anything else  not on\n\n\fthe evidence.",
    "And so James Bentley was arrested and committed\nfor trial and was duly tried and has been found guilty.",
    "They\ncouldnt have found him anything else not on the evidence.",
    "And\nevidence is what a jury have to consider.",
    "Didnt have any qualms\nabout it either I should say.",
    "No I should say they were all quite\nsatisfied he was guilty.",
    "But you  are not\n\nNo.",
    "Why\n\nSuperintendent Spence sighed.",
    "He rubbed his chin thoughtfully\nwith his big hand.",
    "I dont know.",
    "What I mean is I cant give a reason  a concrete\nreason.",
    "To the jury I dare say he looked like a murderer  to me he\ndidnt  and I know a lot more about murderers than they do.",
    "Yes yes you are an expert.",
    "For one thing you know he wasnt cocky.",
    "Not cocky at all And in\nmy experience they usually are.",
    "Always so damned pleased with\nthemselves.",
    "Always think theyre stringing you along.",
    "Always sure\ntheyve been so clever about the whole thing.",
    "And even when\ntheyre in the dock and must know theyre for it theyre still in a\nqueer sort of way getting a kick out of it all.",
    "Theyre in the limelight.",
    "Theyre the central figure.",
    "Playing the star part  perhaps for the\nfirst time in their lives.",
    "Theyre  well  you know  cocky\n\n\fSpence brought out the word with an air of finality.",
    "Youll understand what I mean by that M. Poirot.",
    "I understand very well.",
    "And this James Bentley  he was not like\nthat\n\nNo.",
    "He was  well just scared stiff.",
    "Scared stiff from the start.",
    "And\nto some people that would square in with his being guilty.",
    "But not\nto me.",
    "No I agree with you.",
    "What is he like this James Bentley\n\nThirtythree medium height sallow complexion wears glasses.",
    "Poirot arrested the flow.",
    "No I do not mean his physical characteristics.",
    "What sort of a\npersonality\n\nOh\n\n\n\nthat.",
    "Superintendent\n\nSpence\n\nconsidered.",
    "Unprepossessing sort of fellow.",
    "Nervous manner.",
    "Cant look you\nstraight in the face.",
    "Has a sly sideways way of peering at you.",
    "Worst possible sort of manner for a jury.",
    "Sometimes cringing and\nsometimes truculent.",
    "Blusters in an inefficient kind of way.",
    "He paused and added in a conversational tone\n\n\fReally a shy kind of chap.",
    "Had a cousin rather like that.",
    "If\nanythings awkward they go and tell some silly lie that hasnt a\nchance of being believed.",
    "He does not sound attractive your James Bentley.",
    "Oh he isnt.",
    "Nobody could like him.",
    "But I dont want to see him\nhanged for all that.",
    "And you think he will be hanged\n\nI dont see why not.",
    "His counsel may lodge an appeal  but if so it\nwill be on very flimsy grounds  a technicality of some kind and I\ndont see that it will have a chance of success.",
    "Did he have a good counsel\n\nYoung Graybrook was allotted to him under the Poor Persons\nDefence Act.",
    "Id say he was thoroughly conscientious and put up\nthe best show he could.",
    "So the man had a fair trial and was condemned by a jury of his\nfellowmen.",
    "Thats right.",
    "A good average jury.",
    "Seven men five women  all\ndecent reasonable souls.",
    "Judge was old Stanisdale.",
    "Scrupulously\nfair  no bias.",
    "So  according to the law of the land  James Bentley has nothing\nto complain of\n\n\fIf hes hanged for something he didnt do hes got something to\ncomplain of\n\nA very just observation.",
    "And the case against him was my case  I collected the facts and\nput them together  and its on that case and those facts that he s\nbeen condemned.",
    "And I dont like it M. Poirot I dont like it.",
    "Hercule Poirot looked for a long time at the red agitated face of\nSuperintendent Spence.",
    "Eh bien he said.",
    "What do you suggest\n\nSpence looked acutely embarrassed.",
    "I expect youve got a pretty good idea of whats coming.",
    "The\nBentley\n\ncase\n\nis\n\nclosed.",
    "Im\n\non\n\nanother\n\ncase\n\nalready\n\n\n\nembezzlement.",
    "Got to go up to Scotland tonight.",
    "Im not a free\nman.",
    "And I  am\n\nSpence nodded in a shamefaced sort of way.",
    "Youve got it.",
    "Awful cheek youll think.",
    "But I cant think of\nanything else  of any other way.",
    "I did all I could at the time I\nexamined every possibility I could.",
    "And I didnt get anywhere.",
    "I\ndont believe I ever would get anywhere.",
    "But who knows it may be\n\n\fdifferent for you.",
    "You look at things in  if youll pardon me for\nsaying so  in a funny sort of way.",
    "Maybe thats the way youve got\nto look at them in this case.",
    "Because if James Bentley didnt kill\nher then somebody else did.",
    "She didnt chop the back of her head\nin herself.",
    "You may be able to find something that I missed.",
    "Theres\nno reason why you should do anything about this business.",
    "Its\ninfernal cheek my even suggesting such a thing.",
    "But there it is.",
    "I\ncame to you because it was the only thing I could think of.",
    "But if\nyou dont want to put yourself out  and why should you \n\nPoirot interrupted him.",
    "Oh but indeed there are reasons.",
    "I have leisure  too much\nleisure.",
    "And you have intrigued me  yes you have intrigued me\nvery much.",
    "It is a challenge  to the little grey cells of my brain.",
    "And\nthen I have a regard for you.",
    "I see you in your garden in six\nmonths time planting perhaps the rose bushes  and as you plant\nthem it is not with the happiness you should be feeling because\nbehind everything there is an unpleasantness in your brain a\nrecollection that you try to push away and I would not have you\nfeel that my friend.",
    "And finally  Poirot sat upright and nodded his\nhead vigorously there is the principle of the thing.",
    "If a man has\nnot committed murder he should not be hanged.",
    "He paused and\nthen added But supposing that after all he did kill her\n\nIn that case Id be only too thankful to be convinced of it.",
    "And two heads are better than one Voil\u00e0 everything is settled.",
    "I\nprecipitate myself upon the business.",
    "There is that is clear no\n\n\ftime to be lost.",
    "Already the scent is cold.",
    "Mrs McGinty was killed when\n\nLast November 22nd.",
    "Then let us at once get down to the brass tacks.",
    "Ive got my notes on the case which Ill pass over to you.",
    "Good.",
    "For the moment we need only the bare outline.",
    "If James\nBentley did not kill Mrs McGinty who did\n\nSpence shrugged his shoulders and said heavily\n\nTheres nobody so far as I can see.",
    "But that answer we do not accept.",
    "Now since for every murder\nthere must be a motive what in the case of Mrs McGinty could the\nmotive be Envy revenge jealousy fear money Let us take the\nlast and the simplest Who profited by her death\n\nNobody very much.",
    "She had two hundred pounds in the Savings\nBank.",
    "Her niece gets that.",
    "Two hundred pounds is not very much  but in certain\ncircumstances it could be enough.",
    "So let us consider the niece.",
    "I\napologise my friend for treading in your footsteps.",
    "You too I\nknow must have considered all this.",
    "But I have to go over with you\nthe ground already traversed.",
    "Spence nodded his large head.",
    "We considered the niece of course.",
    "Shes thirtyeight married.",
    "Husband is employed in the building and decorating trade  a\npainter.",
    "Hes got a good character steady employment sharp sort\nof fellow no fool.",
    "Shes a pleasant young woman a bit talkative\nseemed fond of her aunt in a mild sort of way.",
    "Neither of them had\nany urgent need for two hundred pounds though quite pleased to\nhave it I dare say.",
    "What about her cottage Do they get that\n\nIt was rented.",
    "Of course under the Rent Restriction Act the\nlandlord couldnt get the old woman out.",
    "But now shes dead I\ndont think the niece could have taken over  anyway she and her\nhusband didnt want to.",
    "Theyve got a small modern council house\nof their own of which they are extremely proud.",
    "Spence sighed.",
    "I\nwent into the niece and her husband pretty closely  they seemed\nthe best bet as youll understand.",
    "But I couldnt get hold of\nanything.",
    "Bien.",
    "Now let us talk about Mrs McGinty herself.",
    "Describe her to\nme  and not only in physical terms if you please.",
    "Spence grinned.",
    "Dont want a police description Well she was sixtyfour.",
    "Widow.",
    "Husband had been employed in the drapery department of Hodges\nin Kilchester.",
    "He died about seven years ago.",
    "Pneumonia.",
    "Since\nthen Mrs McGinty has been going out daily to various houses\n\n\fround about.",
    "Domestic chores.",
    "Broadhinnys a small village which\nhas lately become residential.",
    "One or two retired people one of\nthe partners in an engineering works a doctor that sort of thing.",
    "Theres quite a good bus and train service to Kilchester and\nCullenquay which as I expect you know is quite a large summer\nresort is only eight miles away but Broadhinny itself is still quite\npretty and rural  about a quarter of a mile off the main Drymouth\nand Kilchester road.",
    "Poirot nodded.",
    "Mrs McGintys cottage was one of four that form the village\nproper.",
    "There s the post office and village shop and agricultural\nlabourers live in the others.",
    "And she took in a lodger\n\nYes.",
    "Before her husband died it used to be summer visitors but\nafter his death she just took one regular.",
    "James Bentley had been\nthere for some months.",
    "So we come to  James Bentley\n\nBentleys last job was with a house agents in Kilchester.",
    "Before\nthat he lived with his mother in Cullenquay.",
    "She was an invalid and\nhe looked after her and never went out much.",
    "Then she died and\nan annuity she had died with her.",
    "He sold the little house and found\na job.",
    "Well educated man but no special qualifications or\naptitudes and as I say an unprepossessing manner.",
    "Didnt find it\neasy to get anything.",
    "Anyway they took him on at Breather \n\n\fScuttles.",
    "Rather a secondrate firm.",
    "I dont think he was\nparticularly efficient or successful.",
    "They cut down staff and he was\nthe one to go.",
    "He couldnt get another job and his money ran out.",
    "He usually paid Mrs McGinty every month for his room.",
    "She gave\nhim breakfast and supper and charged him three pounds a week quite reasonable all things considered.",
    "He was two months\nbehind in paying her and he was nearly at the end of his\nresources.",
    "He hadnt got another job and she was pressing him for\nwhat he owed her.",
    "And he knew that she had thirty pounds in the house Why did\nshe have thirty pounds in the house by the way since she had a\nSavings Bank account\n\nBecause she didnt trust the Government.",
    "Said theyd got two\nhundred pounds of her money but they wouldnt get any more.",
    "Shed keep that where she could lay her hand on it any minute.",
    "She\nsaid that to one or two people.",
    "It was under a loose board in her\nbedroom floor  a very obvious place.",
    "James Bentley admitted he\nknew it was there.",
    "Very obliging of him.",
    "And did niece and husband know that too\n\nOh yes.",
    "Then we have now arrived back at my first question to you.",
    "How\ndid Mrs McGinty die\n\nShe died on the night of November 22nd.",
    "Police surgeon put the\ntime of death as being between 7 and 10 p.m.",
    "Shed had her\n\n\fsupper  a kipper and bread and margarine and according to all\naccounts she usually had that about halfpast six.",
    "If she adhered\nto that on the night in question then by the evidence of digestion\nshe was killed about eightthirty or nine oclock.",
    "James Bentley by\nhis own account was out walking that evening from sevenfifteen\nto about nine.",
    "He went out and walked most evenings after dark.",
    "According to his own story he came in at about nine oclock he\nhad his own key and went straight upstairs to his room.",
    "Mrs\nMcGinty had had washbasins fixed in the bedrooms because of\nsummer visitors.",
    "He read for about half an hour and then went to\nbed.",
    "He heard and noticed nothing out of the way.",
    "Next morning he\ncame downstairs and looked into the kitchen but there was no one\nthere and no signs of breakfast being prepared.",
    "He says he\nhesitated a bit and then knocked on Mrs McGintys door but got no\nreply.",
    "He thought she must have overslept but didnt like to go on\nknocking.",
    "Then the baker came and James Bentley went up and\nknocked again and after that as I told you the baker went next\ndoor and fetched in a Mrs Elliot who eventually found the body and\nwent off the deep end.",
    "Mrs McGinty was lying on the parlour floor.",
    "Shed been hit on the back of the head with something rather in the\nnature of a meat chopper with a very sharp edge.",
    "Shed been killed\ninstantaneously.",
    "Drawers were pulled open and things strewn\nabout and the loose board in the floor in her bedroom had been\nprised up and the cache was empty.",
    "All the windows were closed\nand shuttered on the inside.",
    "No signs of anything being tampered\nwith or of being broken into from outside.",
    "Therefore said Poirot either James Bentley must have killed\nher or else she must have admitted her killer herself whilst\nBentley was out\n\nExactly.",
    "It wasnt any holdup or burglar.",
    "Now who would she be\nlikely to let in One of the neighbours or her niece or her nieces\nhusband.",
    "It boils down to that.",
    "We eliminated the neighbours.",
    "Niece and her husband were at the pictures that night.",
    "It is\npossible  just possible that one or other of them left the cinema\nunobserved bicycled three miles killed the old woman hid the\nmoney outside the house and got back into the cinema unnoticed.",
    "We looked into that possibility but we didnt find any confirmation\nof it.",
    "And why hide the money outside McGintys house if so\nDifficult place to pick it up later.",
    "Why not somewhere along the\nthree miles back No the only reason for hiding it where it was\nhidden \n\nPoirot finished the sentence for him.",
    "would be because you were living in that house but didnt want\nto hide it in your room or anywhere inside.",
    "In fact James Bentley.",
    "Thats right.",
    "Everywhere every time you came up against\nBentley.",
    "Finally there was the blood on his cuff.",
    "How did he account for that\n\nSaid he remembered brushing up against a butchers chop the\nprevious day.",
    "Baloney It wasnt animal blood.",
    "And he stuck to that story\n\nNot likely.",
    "At the trial he told a completely different tale.",
    "You see\nthere was a hair on the cuff as well  a bloodstained hair and the\nhair was identical with Mrs McGintys hair.",
    "That had got to be\nexplained away.",
    "He admitted then that he had gone into the room\nthe night before when he came back from his walk.",
    "Hed gone in\nhe said after knocking and found her there on the floor dead.",
    "Hed bent over and touched her he said to make sure.",
    "And then\nhed lost his head.",
    "Hed always been very much affected by the\nsight of blood he said.",
    "He went to his room in a state of collapse\nand more or less fainted.",
    "In the morning he couldnt bring himself\nto admit he knew what had happened.",
    "A very fishy story commented Poirot.",
    "Yes indeed.",
    "And yet you know said Spence thought fully it\nmight well be true.",
    "Its not the sort of thing that an ordinary man or a jury  can believe.",
    "But Ive come across people like that.",
    "I dont\nmean the collapse story.",
    "I mean people who are confronted by a\ndemand for responsible action and who simply cant face up to it.",
    "Shy people.",
    "He goes in say and finds her.",
    "He knows that he ought\nto do something  get the police  go to a neighbour  do the right\nthing whatever it is.",
    "And he funks it.",
    "He thinks I dont need to know\nanything about it.",
    "I neednt have come in here tonight.",
    "Ill go to bed\njust as if I hadnt come in here at all...",
    "Behind it of course theres\nfear  fear that he may be suspected of having a hand in it.",
    "He\nthinks hell keep himself out of it as long as possible and so the\nsilly juggins goes and puts himself into it  up to his neck.",
    "Spence paused.",
    "It could have been that way.",
    "It could said Poirot thoughtfully.",
    "Or again it may have been just the best story his counsel could\nthink up for him.",
    "But I dont know.",
    "The waitress in the caf\u00e9 in\nKilchester where he usually had lunch said that he always chose a\ntable where he could look into a wall or a corner and not see\npeople.",
    "He was that kind of a chap  just a bit screwy.",
    "But not\nscrewy enough to be a killer.",
    "Hed no persecution complex or\nanything of that kind.",
    "Spence looked hopefully at Poirot  but Poirot did not respond  he\nwas frowning.",
    "The two men sat silent for a while.",
    "Chapter 3\n\nAt last Poirot roused himself with a sigh.",
    "Eh bien he said.",
    "We have exhausted the motive of money.",
    "Let\nus pass to other theories.",
    "Had Mrs McGinty an enemy Was she\nafraid of anyone\n\nNo evidence of it.",
    "What did her neighbours have to say\n\nNot very much.",
    "They wouldnt to the police perhaps but I dont\nthink they were holding anything back.",
    "She kept herself to herself\nthey said.",
    "But thats regarded as natural enough.",
    "Our villages you\nknow M. Poirot arent friendly.",
    "Evacuees found that during the\nwar.",
    "Mrs McGinty passed the time of the day with the neighbours\nbut they werent intimate.",
    "How long had she lived there\n\nMatter of eighteen or twenty years I think.",
    "And the forty years before that\n\nTheres no mystery about her.",
    "Farmers daughter from North\nDevon.",
    "She and her husband lived near Ilfracombe for a time and\nthen moved to Kilchester.",
    "Had a cottage the other side of it  but\nfound it damp so they moved to Broadhinny.",
    "Husband seems to\nhave been a quiet decent man delicate  didnt go to the pub\nmuch.",
    "All very respectable and aboveboard.",
    "No mysteries\nanywhere nothing to hide.",
    "And yet she was killed\n\nAnd yet she was killed.",
    "The niece didnt know of anyone who had a grudge against her\naunt\n\n\fShe says not.",
    "Poirot rubbed his nose in an exasperated fashion.",
    "You comprehend my dear friend it would be so much easier if\nMrs McGinty was not Mrs McGinty so to speak.",
    "If she could be\nwhat is called a Mystery Woman  a woman with a past.",
    "Well she wasnt said Spence stolidly.",
    "She was just Mrs\nMcGinty a more or less uneducated woman who let rooms and\nwent our charring.",
    "Thousands of them all over England.",
    "But they do not all get murdered.",
    "No.",
    "I grant you that.",
    "So why should Mrs McGinty get murdered The obvious answer\nwe do not accept.",
    "What remains A shadowy and improbable\nniece.",
    "An even more shadowy and improbable stranger.",
    "Facts\nLet us stick to facts.",
    "What are the facts An elderly charwoman is\nmurdered.",
    "A shy and uncouth young man is arrested and\nconvicted of the murder.",
    "Why was James Bentley arrested\n\nSpence stared.",
    "The evidence against him.",
    "Ive told you \n\nYes.",
    "Evidence.",
    "But tell me my Spence was it real evidence or\nwas it contrived\n\n\fContrived\n\nYes.",
    "Granted the premises that James Bentley is innocent two\npossibilities\n\nremain.",
    "The\n\nevidence\n\nwas\n\nmanufactured\n\ndeliberately to throw suspicion against him.",
    "Or else he was just\nthe unfortunate victim of circumstances.",
    "Yes.",
    "I see what youre driving at.",
    "There is nothing to show that the former was the case.",
    "But again\nthere is nothing to show that it was not so.",
    "The money was taken\nand hidden outside the house in a place easily found.",
    "To have\nactually hidden it in his room would have been a little too much for\nthe police to swallow.",
    "The murder was committed at a time when\nBentley was taking a lonely walk as he often did.",
    "Did the\nbloodstain come on his sleeve as he said it did at his trial or was\nthat too contrived Did someone brush against him in the\ndarkness and smear telltale evidence on his sleeve\n\nI think thats going a bit far M. Poirot.",
    "Perhaps perhaps.",
    "But we have got to go far.",
    "I think that in this\ncase we have got to go so far that the imagination cannot as yet\nsee the path clearly... For you see Mon cher Spence if Mrs\nMcGinty is just an ordinary char woman  it is the murderer who\nmust be extraordinary.",
    "Yes  that follows clearly.",
    "It is in the\nmurderer and not the murdered that the interest of this case lies.",
    "That is not the case in most crimes.",
    "Usually it is in the personality\nof the murdered person that the crux of the situation lies.",
    "It is the\n\n\fsilent dead in whom I am usually interested.",
    "Their hates their\nloves their actions.",
    "And when you really know the murdered\nvictim then the victim speaks and those dead lips utter a name the name you want to know.",
    "Spence looked rather uncomfortable.",
    "These foreigners he seemed to be saying to himself.",
    "But here continued Poirot it is the opposite.",
    "Here we guess at\na veiled personality  a figure still hidden in darkness.",
    "How did Mrs\nMcGinty die Why did she die The answer is not to be found in\nstudying the life of Mrs McGinty.",
    "The answer is to be found in the\npersonality of the murderer.",
    "You agree with me there\n\nI suppose so said Superintendent Spence cautiously.",
    "Someone who wanted what To strike down Mrs McGinty Or to\nstrike down James Bentley\n\nThe Superintendent gave a doubtful Hm\n\nYes  yes that is one of the first points to be decided.",
    "Who is the\nreal victim Who was intended to be the victim\n\nSpence said incredulously You really think someone would bump\noff a perfectly inoffensive old woman in order to get someone else\nhanged for murder\n\n\fOne cannot make an omelette they say without breaking eggs.",
    "Mrs McGinty then may be the egg and James Bentley is the\nomelette.",
    "So let me hear now what you know of James Bentley.",
    "Nothing much.",
    "Father was a doctor  died when Bentley was nine\nyears old.",
    "He went to one of the smaller public schools unfit for\nthe Army had a weak chest was in one of the Ministries during the\nwar and lived with a possessive mother.",
    "Well said Poirot there are certain possibilities there... More\nthan there are in the life history of Mrs McGinty.",
    "Do you seriously believe what you are suggesting\n\nNo I do not believe anything as yet.",
    "But I say that there are two\ndistinct lines of research and that we have to decide very soon\nwhich is the right one to follow.",
    "How are you going to set about things M. Poirot Is there\nanything I can do\n\nFirst I should like an interview with James Bentley.",
    "That can be managed.",
    "Ill get on to his solicitors.",
    "After that and subject of course to the result if any  I am not\nhopeful  of that interview I shall go to Broadhinny.",
    "There aided by\nyour notes I shall as quickly as possible go over that same\nground where you have passed before me.",
    "In case Ive missed anything said Spence with a wry smile.",
    "In case I would prefer to say that some circumstance should\nstrike me in a different light to the one in which it struck you.",
    "Human reactions vary and so does human experience.",
    "The\nresemblance of a rich financier to a soap boiler whom I had known\nin Liege once brought about a most satisfactory result.",
    "But no\nneed to go into that.",
    "What I should like to do is to eliminate one or\nother of the trails I indicated just now.",
    "And to eliminate the Mrs\nMcGinty trail  trail No.",
    "1  will obviously be quicker and easier than\nto attack trail No.",
    "2.",
    "Where now can I stay in Broadhinny Is there\nan inn of moderate comfort\n\nTheres the Three Ducks  but it doesnt put people up.",
    "Theres the\nLamb in Cullavon three miles away  or there is a kind of a Guest\nHouse in Broadhinny itself.",
    "Its not really a Guest House just a\nrather decrepit country house where the young couple who own it\ntake in paying guests.",
    "I dont think said Spence dubiously that\nits very comfortable.",
    "Hercule Poirot closed his eyes in agony.",
    "If I suffer I suffer he said.",
    "It has to be.",
    "I dont know what youll go there as continued Spence doubtfully\nas he eyed Poirot.",
    "You might be some kind of an opera singer.",
    "Voice broken down.",
    "Got to rest.",
    "That might do.",
    "I shall go said Hercule Poirot speaking with accents of royal\nblood as myself.",
    "Spence received this pronouncement with pursed lips.",
    "Dyou think thats advisable\n\nI think it is essential But yes essential.",
    "Consider cher ami it is\ntime we are up against.",
    "What do we know Nothing.",
    "So the hope\nthe best hope is to go pretending that I know a great deal.",
    "I am\nHercule Poirot.",
    "I am the great the unique Hercule Poirot.",
    "And I\nHercule Poirot am not satisfied about the verdict in the McGinty\ncase.",
    "I Hercule Poirot have a very shrewd suspicion of what\nreally happened.",
    "There is a circumstance that I alone estimate at\nits true value.",
    "You see\n\nAnd then\n\nAnd then having made my effect I observe the reactions.",
    "For\nthere should be reactions.",
    "Very definitely there should be\nreactions.",
    "Superintendent Spence looked uneasily at the little man.",
    "Look here M. Poirot he said.",
    "Dont go sticking out your neck.",
    "I\ndont want anything to happen to you.",
    "But if it does you would be proved right beyond the shadow of\ndoubt is it not so\n\nI dont want it proved the hard way said Superintendent Spence.",
    "Chapter 4\n\nWith great distaste Hercule Poirot looked round the room in which\nhe stood.",
    "It was a room of gracious proportions but there its\nattraction ended.",
    "Poirot made an eloquent grimace as he drew a\nsuspicious finger along the top of a book case.",
    "As he had\nsuspected  dust He sat down gingerly on a sofa and its broken\nsprings sagged depressingly under him.",
    "The two faded armchairs\nwere as he knew little better.",
    "A large fiercelooking dog whom\nPoirot suspected of having mange growled from his position on a\nmoderately comfortable fourth chair.",
    "The room was large and had a faded Morris wallpaper.",
    "Steel\nengravings of unpleasant subjects hung crookedly on the walls\nwith one or two good oil paintings.",
    "The chaircovers were both\nfaded and dirty the carpet had holes in it and had never been of a\npleasant design.",
    "A good deal of miscellaneous bricabrac was\nscattered haphazard here and there.",
    "Tables rocked dangerously\nowing to absence of castors.",
    "One window was open and no power\non earth could apparently shut it again.",
    "The door temporarily\nshut was not likely to remain so.",
    "The latch did not hold and with\nevery gust of wind it burst open and whirling gusts of cold wind\neddied round the room.",
    "I suffer said Hercule Poirot to himself in acute selfpity.",
    "Yes I\nsuffer.",
    "The door burst open and the wind and Mrs Summerhayes came in\ntogether.",
    "She looked round the room shouted What to\nsomeone in the distance and went out again.",
    "Mrs Summerhayes had red hair and an attractively freckled face\nand was usually in a distracted state of putting things down or\nelse looking for them.",
    "Hercule Poirot sprang to his feet and shut the door.",
    "A moment or two later it opened again and Mrs Summerhayes\nreappeared.",
    "This time she was carrying a large enamel basin and\na knife.",
    "A mans voice from some way away called out\n\nMaureen that cats been sick again.",
    "What shall I do\n\nMrs Summerhayes called Im coming darling.",
    "Hold everything.",
    "She dropped the basin and the knife and went out again.",
    "Poirot got up again and shut the door.",
    "He said\n\nDecidedly I suffer.",
    "A car drove up the large dog leaped from the chair and raised its\nvoice in a crescendo of barking.",
    "He jumped on a small table by the\nwindow and the table collapsed with a crash.",
    "Enfin said Hercule Poirot.",
    "Cest insupportable\n\nThe door burst open the wind surged round the room the dog\nrushed out still barking.",
    "Maureens voice came upraised loud and\nclear.",
    "Johnnie why the hell did you leave the back door open Those\nbloody hens are in the larder.",
    "And for this said Hercule Poirot with feeling I pay seven\nguineas a week\n\nThe door banged to with a crash.",
    "Through the window came the\nloud squawking of irate hens.",
    "Then the door opened again and Maureen Summerhayes came in\nand fell upon the basin with a cry of joy.",
    "Couldnt think where Id left it.",
    "Would you mind frightfully Mr Er hum  I mean would it bother you if I sliced the beans in here The\nsmell in the kitchen is too frightful.",
    "Madame I should be enchanted.",
    "It was not perhaps the exact phrase but it was near enough.",
    "It\nwas the first time in twentyfour hours that Poirot had seen any\nchance of a conversation of more than six seconds duration.",
    "Mrs Summerhayes flung herself down in a chair and began slicing\nbeans with frenzied energy and considerable awkwardness.",
    "I\n\ndo\n\nhope\n\nshe\n\nsaid\n\nthat\n\nyoure\n\nnot\n\ntoo\n\nfrightfully\n\nuncomfortable If theres anything you want altered do say so.",
    "Poirot had already come to the opinion that the only thing in Long\nMeadows he could even tolerate was his hostess.",
    "You are too kind madame he replied politely.",
    "I only wish it\nwere within my powers to provide you with suitable domestics.",
    "Domestics Mrs Summerhayes gave a squeal.",
    "What a hope\nCant even get hold of a daily.",
    "Our really good one was murdered.",
    "Just my luck.",
    "That would be Mrs McGinty said Poirot quickly.",
    "Mrs McGinty it was.",
    "God how I miss that woman Of course it was\nall a big thrill at the time.",
    "First murder weve ever had right in the\nfamily so to speak but as I told Johnnie it was a downright bit of\nbad luck for us.",
    "Without McGinty I just cant cope.",
    "You were attached to her\n\nMy dear man she was reliable.",
    "She came.",
    "Monday afternoons\nand Thursday mornings  just like a clock.",
    "Now I have that Burp\nwoman from up by the station.",
    "Five children and a husband.",
    "Naturally shes never here.",
    "Either the husbands taken queer or\nthe old mother or the children have some foul disease or other.",
    "With old McGinty at least it was only she herself who came over\nqueer and I must say she hardly ever did.",
    "And you found her always reliable and honest You had trust in\nher\n\nOh shed never pinch anything  not even food.",
    "Of course she\nsnooped a bit.",
    "Had a look at ones letters and all that.",
    "But one\nexpects that sort of thing.",
    "I mean they must live such awfully drab\nlives mustnt they\n\nHad Mrs McGinty had a drab life\n\nGhastly I expect said Mrs Summerhayes vaguely.",
    "Always on\nyour knees scrubbing.",
    "And then piles of other peoples washing up\nwaiting for you on the sink when you arrive in the morning.",
    "If I had\nto face that every day Id be positively relieved to be murdered.",
    "I\nreally would.",
    "The face of Major Summerhayes appeared at the window.",
    "Mrs\nSummerhayes sprang up upsetting the beans and rushed across\nto the window which she opened to the fullest extent.",
    "That damned dogs eaten the hens food again Maureen.",
    "Oh damn now hell be sick\n\nLook here John Summerhayes displayed a colander of\ngreenery is this enough spinach\n\nOf course not.",
    "Seems a colossal amount to me.",
    "Itll be about a teaspoonful when its cooked.",
    "Dont you know by\nnow what spinach is like\n\nOh lord\n\nHas the fish come\n\nNot a sign of it.",
    "Hell well have to open a tin of something.",
    "You might do that\nJohnnie.",
    "One of the ones in the corner cupboard.",
    "That one we\nthought was a bit bulged.",
    "I expect its quite all right really.",
    "What about the spinach\n\nIll get that.",
    "She leaped through the window and husband and wife moved\naway together.",
    "Nom dun nom dun nom said Hercule Poirot.",
    "He crossed the\nroom and closed the window as nearly as he could.",
    "The voice of\nMajor Summerhayes came to him borne on the wind.",
    "What about this new fellow Maureen Looks a bit peculiar to me.",
    "Whats his name again\n\n\fI couldnt remember it just now when I was talking to him.",
    "Had to\nsay Mr Erum.",
    "Poirot  thats what it is.",
    "Hes French.",
    "You know Maureen I seem to have seen that name somewhere.",
    "Home Perm perhaps.",
    "He looks like a hairdresser.",
    "Poirot winced.",
    "Nno.",
    "Perhaps its pickles.",
    "I dont know.",
    "Im sure its familiar.",
    "Better get the first seven guineas out of him quick.",
    "The voices died away.",
    "Hercule Poirot picked up the beans from the floor where they had\nscattered far and wide.",
    "Just as he finished doing so Mrs\nSummerhayes came in again through the door.",
    "He presented them to her politely\n\nVoici Madame.",
    "Oh thanks awfully.",
    "I say these beans look a bit black.",
    "We store\nthen you know in crocks salted down.",
    "But these seem to have\ngone wrong.",
    "Im afraid they wont be very nice.",
    "I too fear that... You permit that I shut the door There is a\ndecided draught.",
    "Oh yes do.",
    "Im afraid I always leave doors open.",
    "So I have noticed.",
    "Anyway that door never stays shut.",
    "This house is practically\nfalling to pieces.",
    "Johnnies father and mother lived here and they\nwere very badly off poor dears and they never did a thing to it.",
    "And then when we came home from India to live here we couldnt\nafford to do anything either.",
    "Its fun for the children in the holidays\nthough lots of room to run wild in and the garden and everything.",
    "Having paying guests here just enables us to keep going though I\nmust say weve had a few rude shocks.",
    "Am I your only guest at present\n\nWeve got an old lady upstairs.",
    "Took to her bed the day she came\nand has been there ever since.",
    "Nothing the matter with her that I\ncan see.",
    "But there she is and I carry up four trays a day.",
    "Nothing\nwrong with her appetite.",
    "Anyway shes going tomorrow to some\nniece or other.",
    "Mrs Summerhayes paused for a moment before resuming in a\nslightly artificial voice.",
    "The fishman will be here in a minute.",
    "I wonder if youd mind  er forking out the first weeks rent.",
    "You are staying a week arent\nyou\n\nPerhaps longer.",
    "Sorry to bother you.",
    "But Ive not got any cash in the house and\nyou know what these people are like  always dunning you.",
    "Pray do not apologise madame.",
    "Poirot took out seven pound notes and added seven shillings.",
    "Mrs\nSummerhayes gathered the money up with avidity.",
    "Thanks a lot.",
    "I should perhaps Madame tell you a little more about myself.",
    "I\nam Hercule Poirot.",
    "The revelation left Mrs Summerhayes unmoved.",
    "What a lovely name she said kindly.",
    "Greek isnt it\n\nI am as you may know said Poirot a detective.",
    "He tapped his\nchest.",
    "Perhaps the most famous detective there is.",
    "Mrs Summerhayes screamed with amusement.",
    "I see youre a great practical joker M. Poirot.",
    "What are you\ndetecting Cigarette ash and footprints\n\nI am investigating the murder of Mrs McGinty said Poirot.",
    "And I\ndo not joke.",
    "Ouch said Mrs Summerhayes.",
    "Ive cut my hand.",
    "She raised a finger and inspected it.",
    "Then she stared at Poirot.",
    "Look here she said.",
    "Do you mean it What I mean is its over\nall that.",
    "They arrested that poor halfwit who lodged there and hes\nbeen tried and convicted and everything.",
    "Hes probably been\nhanged by now.",
    "No madame said Poirot.",
    "He has not been hanged  yet.",
    "And it\nis not over  the case of Mrs McGinty.",
    "I will remind you of the line\nfrom one of your poets.",
    "A question is never settled until it is\nsettled  right.",
    "Oo said Mrs Summerhayes her attention diverted from Poirot to\nthe basin in her lap.",
    "Im bleeding over the beans.",
    "Not too good as\nweve got to have them for lunch.",
    "Still it wont matter really\nbecause theyll go into boiling water.",
    "Thing are always all right if\nyou boil them arent they Even tins.",
    "I think said Hercule Poirot quietly that I shall not be in for\nlunch.",
    "Chapter 5\n\nI dont know Im sure said Mrs Burch.",
    "She had said that three times already.",
    "Her natural distrust of\nforeignlooking gentlemen with black moustaches wearing large\nfur lined coats was not to be easily overcome.",
    "Very unpleasant its been she went on.",
    "Having poor Auntie\nmurdered and the police and all that.",
    "Tramping round everywhere\nand ferreting about and asking questions.",
    "With the neighbours all\nagog.",
    "I didnt feel at first wed ever live it down.",
    "And my husbands\nmothers been downright nasty about it.",
    "Nothing of that kind ever\nhappened in her family she kept saying.",
    "And poor Joe and all\nthat.",
    "What about poor me She was my aunt wasnt she But\nreally I did think it was all over now.",
    "And supposing that James Bentley is innocent after all\n\nNonsense snapped Mrs Burch.",
    "Of course he isnt innocent.",
    "He\ndid it all right.",
    "I never did like the looks of him.",
    "Wandering about\nmuttering to himself.",
    "Said to Auntie I did You oughtnt to have a\nman like that in the house.",
    "Might go off his head I said.",
    "But she\nsaid he was quiet and obliging and didnt give trouble.",
    "No drinking\nshe said and he didnt even smoke.",
    "Well she knows better now\npoor soul.",
    "Poirot looked thoughtfully at her.",
    "She was a big plump woman\nwith a healthy colour and a goodhumoured mouth.",
    "The small\nhouse was neat and clean and smelt of furniture polish and brasso.",
    "A faint appetising smell came from the direction of the kitchen.",
    "A good wife who kept her house clean and took the trouble to cook\nfor her man.",
    "He approved.",
    "She was prejudiced and obstinate but\n\n\fafter all why not Most decidedly she was not the kind of woman\none could imagine using a meat chopper on her aunt or conniving\nat her husbands doing so.",
    "Spence had not thought her that kind of\nwoman and rather reluctantly Hercule Poirot agreed with him.",
    "Spence had gone into the financial background of the Burches and\nhad found no motive there for murder and Spence was a very\nthorough man.",
    "He sighed and persevered with his task which was the breaking\ndown of Mrs Burchs suspicion of foreigners.",
    "He led the\nconversation away from murder and focused on the victim of it.",
    "He\nasked questions about poor Auntie her health her habits her\npreferences in food and drink her politics her late husband her\nattitude to life to sex to sin to religion to children to animals.",
    "Whether any of this irrelevant matter would be of use he had no\nidea.",
    "He was looking through a haystack to find a needle.",
    "But\nincidentally he was learning something about Bessie Burch.",
    "Bessie did not really know very much about her aunt.",
    "It had been a\nfamily tie honoured as such but without intimacy.",
    "Now and again\nonce a month or so she and Joe had gone over on a Sunday to\nhave midday dinner with Auntie and more rarely Auntie had come\nover to see them.",
    "They had exchanged presents at Christmas.",
    "Theyd known that Auntie had a little something put by and that\ntheyd get it when she died.",
    "But thats not to say we were needing it Mrs Butch explained\nwith rising colour.",
    "Weve got something put by ourselves.",
    "And we\n\n\fburied her beautiful.",
    "A real nice funeral it was.",
    "Flowers and\neverything.",
    "Auntie had been fond of knitting.",
    "She didnt like dogs they messed\nup a place but she used to have a cat  a ginger.",
    "It strayed away\nand she hadnt had one since but the woman at the post office had\nbeen going to give her a kitten.",
    "Kept her house very neat and\ndidnt like litter.",
    "Kept brass a treat and washed down the kitchen\nfloor every day.",
    "She made quite a nice thing of going out to work.",
    "One shilling and tenpence an hour  two shillings from Holmeleigh\nthat was Mr Carpenters of the Works house.",
    "Rolling in money the\nCarpenters were.",
    "Tried to get Auntie to come more days in the\nweek but Auntie wouldnt disappoint her other ladies because\nshed gone to them before she went to Mr Carpenters and it\nwouldnt have been right.",
    "Poirot mentioned Mrs Summerhayes at Long Meadows.",
    "Oh yes Auntie went to her  two days a week.",
    "Theyd come back\nfrom India where theyd had a lot of native servants and Mrs\nSummerhayes didnt know a thing about a house.",
    "They tried to\nmarketgarden but they didnt know anything about that either.",
    "When the children came home for the holidays the house was just\npandemonium.",
    "But Mrs Summerhayes was a nice lady and Auntie\nliked her.",
    "So the portrait grew.",
    "Mrs McGinty knitted and scrubbed floors and\npolished brass she liked cats and didnt like dogs.",
    "She liked\nchildren but not very much.",
    "She kept herself to herself.",
    "She attended church on Sunday but didnt take part in any church\nactivities.",
    "Sometimes but rarely she went to the pictures.",
    "She\ndidnt hold with goings on  and had given up working for an artist\nand his wife when she had discovered they werent properly\nmarried.",
    "She didnt read books but she enjoyed the Sunday paper\nand she liked old magazines when her ladies gave them to her.",
    "Although she didnt go much to the pictures she was interested in\nhearing about film stars and their doings.",
    "She wasnt interested in\npolitics but voted Conservative like her husband had always done.",
    "Never spent much on clothes but got quite a lot given her from her\nladies and was of a saving disposition.",
    "Mrs McGinty was in fact very much the Mrs McGinty that Poirot\nhad imagined she would be.",
    "And Bessie Burch her niece was the\nBessie Burch of Superintendent Spences notes.",
    "Before Poirot took his leave Joe Burch came home for the lunch\nhour.",
    "A small shrewd man less easy to be sure about than his\nwife.",
    "There was a faint nervousness in his manner.",
    "He showed less\nsigns of suspicion and hostility than his wife.",
    "Indeed he seemed\nanxious to appear cooperative.",
    "And that Poirot reflected was\nvery faintly out of character.",
    "For why should Joe Burch be anxious\nto placate an importunate foreign stranger The reason could only\nbe that that stranger had brought with him a letter from\nSuperintendent Spence of the County Police.",
    "So Joe Burch was anxious to stand in well with the police Was it\nthat he couldnt afford as his wife could to be critical of the\npolice\n\n\fA man perhaps with an uneasy conscience.",
    "Why was that\nconscience uneasy There could be so many reasons  none of\nthem connected with Mrs McGintys death.",
    "Or was it that\nsomehow or other the cinema alibi had been cleverly faked and\nthat it was Joe Burch who had knocked on the door of the cottage\nhad been admitted by Auntie and who had struck down the\nunsuspecting old woman.",
    "He would pull out the drawers and\nransack the rooms to give the appearance of robbery he might\nhide the money outside cunningly to incriminate James Bentley\nthe money that was in the Savings Bank was what he was after.",
    "Two hundred pounds coming to his wife which for some reason\nunknown he badly needed.",
    "The weapon Poirot remembered had\nnever been found.",
    "Why had that not also been left on the scene of\nthe crime Any moron knew enough to wear gloves or rub off\nfingerprints.",
    "Why then had the weapon which must have been a\nheavy one with a sharp edge been removed Was it because it\ncould easily be identified as belonging to the Burch m\u00e9nage Was\nthat same weapon washed and polished here in the house now\nSomething in the nature of a meat chopper the police surgeon had\nsaid  but not it seemed actually a meat chopper.",
    "Something\nperhaps a little unusual... a little out of the ordinary easily\nidentified.",
    "The police had hunted for it but not found it.",
    "They had\nsearched woods dragged ponds.",
    "There was nothing missing from\nMrs McGintys kitchen and nobody could say that James Bentley\nhad had anything of that kind in his possession.",
    "They had never\ntraced any purchase of a meat chopper or any such implement to\nhim.",
    "A small but negative point in his favour.",
    "Ignored in the weight\nof other evidence.",
    "But still a point...\n\n\fPoirot cast a swift glance round the rather overcrowded little\nsittingroom in which he was sitting.",
    "Was the weapon here somewhere in this house Was that why\nJoe Butch was uneasy and conciliatory\n\nPoirot did not know.",
    "He did not really think so.",
    "But he was not\nabsolutely sure...\n\nChapter 6\n\nIn the offices of Messrs. Breather  Scuttle Poirot was shown\nafter some demur into the room of Mr Scuttle himself.",
    "Mr Scuttle was a brisk bustling man with a hearty manner.",
    "Good morning.",
    "Good morning.",
    "He rubbed his hands.",
    "Now what\ncan we do for you\n\nHis professional eye shot over Poirot trying to place him making\nas it were a series of marginal notes.",
    "Foreign.",
    "Good\n\nquality\n\nclothes.",
    "Probably\n\nrich.",
    "Restaurant\n\nproprietor Hotel manager Films\n\nI hope not to trespass on your time unduly.",
    "I wanted to talk to you\nabout your former employee James Bentley.",
    "Mr Scuttles expressive eyebrows shot up an inch and dropped.",
    "James Bentley.",
    "James Bentley He shot out a question.",
    "Press\n\nNo.",
    "And you wouldnt be police\n\nNo.",
    "At least  not of this country.",
    "Not of this country.",
    "Mr Scuttle filed this away rapidly as though\nfor future reference.",
    "Whats it all about\n\nPoirot never hindered by a pedantic regard for truth launched out\ninto speech.",
    "I am opening a further inquiry into James Bentleys case  at the\nrequest of certain relatives of his.",
    "Didnt know he had any.",
    "Anyway hes been found guilty you\nknow and condemned to death.",
    "But not yet executed.",
    "While theres life theres hope eh Mr Scuttle shook his head.",
    "Should doubt it though.",
    "Evidence was strong.",
    "Who are these\nrelations of his\n\nI can tell you only this they are both rich and powerful.",
    "Immensely rich.",
    "You surprise me.",
    "Mr Scuttle was unable to help thawing slightly.",
    "The words immensely rich had an attractive and hypnotic\nquality.",
    "Yes you really do surprise me.",
    "Bentleys mother the late Mrs Bentley explained Poirot cut\nherself and her son off completely from her family.",
    "One of these family feuds eh Well well.",
    "And young Bentley\nwithout a farthing to bless himself with.",
    "Pity these relations didnt\ncome to the rescue before.",
    "They have only just become aware of the facts explained Poirot.",
    "They have engaged me to come with all speed to this country and\ndo everything possible.",
    "Mr Scuttle leaned back relaxing his business manner.",
    "Dont know what you can do.",
    "I suppose theres insanity A bit late\nin the day  but if you got hold of the big medicos.",
    "Of course Im not\nup in these things myself.",
    "Poirot leaned forward.",
    "Monsieur James Bentley worked here.",
    "You can tell me about\nhim.",
    "Precious little to tell  precious little.",
    "He was one of our junior\nclerks.",
    "Nothing against him.",
    "Seemed a perfectly decent young\nfellow quite conscientious\n\nand all\n\nthat.",
    "But no\n\nidea\n\nof\n\n\fsalesmanship.",
    "He just couldnt put a project over.",
    "Thats no good\nin this job.",
    "If a client comes to us with a house he wants to sell\nwere there to sell it for him.",
    "And if a client wants a house we find\nhim one.",
    "If its a house in a lonely place with no amenities we\nstress its antiquity call it a period piece  and dont mention the\nplumbing And if a house looks straight into the gasworks we talk\nabout amenities and facilities and dont mention the view.",
    "Hustle\nyour client into it  thats what youre here to do.",
    "All sorts of little\ntricks there are.",
    "We advise you madam to make an immediate\noffer.",
    "Theres a Member of Parliament whos very keen on it  very\nkeen indeed.",
    "Going out to see it again this afternoon.",
    "They fall for\nthat every time  a Member of Parliament is always a good touch.",
    "Cant think why No member ever lives away from his constituency.",
    "Its just the good solid sound of it.",
    "He laughed suddenly displayed\ngleaming dentures.",
    "Psychology  thats what it is  just\npsychology.",
    "Poirot leaped at the word.",
    "Psychology.",
    "How right you are.",
    "I see that you are a judge of men.",
    "Not too bad.",
    "Not too bad said Mr Scuttle modestly.",
    "So I ask you again what was your impression of James Bentley\nBetween ourselves  strictly between ourselves  you think he\nkilled the old woman\n\nScuttle stared.",
    "Of course.",
    "And you think too that it was a likely thing for him to do psychologically speaking\n\nWell  if you put it like that  no not really.",
    "Shouldnt have thought\nhe had the guts.",
    "Tell you what if you ask me he was barmy.",
    "Put it\nthat way and it works.",
    "Always a bit soft in the head and what with\nbeing out of a job and worrying and all that he just went right over\nthe edge.",
    "You had no special reason for discharging him\n\nScuttle shook his head.",
    "Bad time of year.",
    "Staff hadnt enough to do.",
    "We sacked the one\nwho was less competent.",
    "That was Bentley.",
    "Always would be I\nexpect.",
    "Gave him a good reference and all that.",
    "He didnt get\nanother job though.",
    "No pep.",
    "Made bad impression on people.",
    "It always came back to that Poirot thought as he left the office.",
    "James Bentley made a bad impression on people.",
    "He took comfort\nin considering various murderers he had known whom most\npeople had found full of charm.",
    "II\n\nExcuse me do you mind if I sit down here and talk to you for a\nmoment\n\n\fPoirot ensconced at a small table in the Blue Cat looked up from\nthe menu he was studying with a start.",
    "It was rather dark in the\nBlue Cat which specialised in an oldworld effect of oak and\nleaded panes but the young woman who had just sat down\nopposite to him stood out brightly from her dark background.",
    "She had determinedly golden hair and was wearing an electric\nblue jumper suit.",
    "Moreover Hercule Poirot was conscious of\nhaving noticed her somewhere only a short time previously.",
    "She went on\n\nI couldnt help you see hearing something of what you were\nsaying to Mr Scuttle.",
    "Poirot nodded.",
    "He had realised that the partitions in the offices of\nBreather  Scuttle were made for convenience rather than\nprivacy.",
    "That had not worried him since it was chiefly publicity\nthat he desired.",
    "You were typing he said to the right of the back window.",
    "She nodded.",
    "Her teeth shone white in an acquiescing smile.",
    "A very\nhealthy young woman with a full buxom figure that Poirot\napproved.",
    "About thirtythree or four he judged and by nature\ndarkhaired but not one to be dictated to by nature.",
    "About Mr Bentley she said.",
    "What about Mr Bentley\n\nIs he going to appeal Does it mean that theres new evidence\nOh Im so glad.",
    "I couldnt  I just couldnt believe he did it.",
    "Poirots eyebrows rose.",
    "So you never thought he did it he said slowly.",
    "Well not at first.",
    "I thought it must be a mistake.",
    "But then the\nevidence  she stopped.",
    "Yes the evidence said Poirot.",
    "There just didnt seem anyone else who could have done it.",
    "I\nthought perhaps hed gone a little mad.",
    "Did he ever seem to you a little  what shall I say  queer\n\nOh no.",
    "Not queer in that way.",
    "He was just shy and awkward as\nanyone might be.",
    "The truth was he didnt make the best of himself.",
    "He hadnt confidence in himself.",
    "Poirot looked at her.",
    "She certainly had confidence in herself.",
    "Possibly she had enough confidence for two.",
    "You liked him he asked.",
    "She flushed.",
    "Yes I did.",
    "Amy  thats the other girl in the office  used to laugh at\nhim and call him a drip but I liked him very much.",
    "He was gentle\nand polite  and he knew a lot really.",
    "Things out of books I mean.",
    "Ah yes things out of books.",
    "He missed his mother.",
    "Shed been ill for years you know.",
    "At least\nnot really ill but not strong and hed done everything for her.",
    "Poirot nodded.",
    "He knew those mothers.",
    "And of course shed looked after him too.",
    "I mean taken care of\nhis health and his chest in winter and what he ate and all that.",
    "Again he nodded.",
    "He asked\n\nYou and he were friends\n\nI dont know  not exactly.",
    "We used to talk sometimes.",
    "But after he\nleft here he  I  I didnt see much of him.",
    "I wrote to him once in a\nfriendly way but he didnt answer.",
    "Poirot said gently\n\nBut you like him\n\nShe said rather defiantly\n\nYes I do...\n\n\fThat is excellent said Poirot.",
    "His mind switched back to the day of his interview with the\ncondemned prisoner.",
    "He saw James Bentley clearly.",
    "The mousecoloured hair the thin awkward body the hands with their big\nknuckles and wrists the Adams apple in the lean neck.",
    "He saw the\nfurtive embarrassed  almost sly glance.",
    "Not straightforward not\na man whose word could be trusted  a secretive sly deceitful\nfellow with an ungracious muttering way of talking... That was the\nimpression James Bentley would give to most superficial\nobservers.",
    "It was the impression he had given in the dock.",
    "The sort\nof fellow who would tell ties and steal money and hit an old\nwoman over the head...",
    "But on Superintendent Spence who knew men he had not made\nthat impression.",
    "Nor on Hercule Poirot And now here was this girl.",
    "What is your name mademoiselle he asked.",
    "Maude Williams.",
    "Is there anything I could do  to help\n\nI think there is.",
    "There are people who believe Miss Williams that\nJames Bentley is innocent.",
    "They are working to prove that fact.",
    "I\nam the person charged with that investigation and I may tell you\nthat\n\nI\n\nhave\n\nalready\n\nmade\n\nconsiderable\n\nprogress\n\n\n\nyes\n\nconsiderable progress.",
    "He uttered that lie without a blush.",
    "To his mind it was a very\nnecessary lie.",
    "Someone somewhere had got to be made uneasy.",
    "Maude Williams would talk and talk was like a stone in a pond it\nmade a ripple that went on spreading outwards...",
    "He said You tell me that you and James Bentley talked together.",
    "He told you about his mother and his home life.",
    "Did he ever\nmention anyone with whom he or perhaps his mother was on bad\nterms\n\nMaude Williams reflected.",
    "No  not what youd call bad terms.",
    "His mother didnt like young\nwomen much I gather.",
    "Mothers of devoted sons never like young women.",
    "No I mean\nmore than that.",
    "Some family feud some enmity.",
    "Someone with a\ngrudge\n\nShe shook her head.",
    "He never mentioned anything of that kind.",
    "Did he ever speak of his landlady Mrs McGinty\n\nShe shivered slightly.",
    "Not by name.",
    "He said once that she gave him kippers much too\noften  and once he said his landlady was upset because she had\nlost her cat.",
    "Did he ever  you must be honest please  mention that he knew\nwhere she kept her money\n\nSome of the colour went out of the girls face but she threw up her\nchin defiantly.",
    "Actually he did.",
    "We were talking about people being distrustful of\nbanks  and he said his old landlady kept her spare money under a\nfloorboard.",
    "He said I could help myself any day to it when shes\nout.",
    "Not quite as a joke he didnt joke more as though he were\nreally worried by her carelessness.",
    "Ah said Poirot.",
    "That is good.",
    "From my point of view I mean.",
    "When James Bentley thinks of stealing it presents itself to him as\nan action that is done behind someones back.",
    "He might have said\nyou see Some day someone will knock her on the head for it.",
    "But either way he wouldnt be meaning it.",
    "Oh no.",
    "But talk however light however idle gives away\ninevitably the sort of person you are.",
    "The wise criminal would\nnever open his mouth but criminals are seldom wise and usually\nvain and they talk a good deal  and so most criminals are caught.",
    "Maude Williams said abruptly\n\nBut someone must have killed the old woman.",
    "Naturally.",
    "Who did Do you know Have you any idea\n\nYes said Hercule Poirot mendaciously.",
    "I think I have a very\ngood idea.",
    "But we are only at the beginning of the road.",
    "The girl glanced at her watch.",
    "I must get back.",
    "Were only supposed to take half an hour.",
    "Onehorse place Kilchester  Ive always had jobs in London before.",
    "Youll let me know if theres anything I can do  really do I mean\n\nPoirot took out one of his cards.",
    "On it he wrote Long Meadows and\nthe telephone number.",
    "That is where I am staying.",
    "His name he noted with chagrin made no particular impression\non her.",
    "The younger generation he could not but feel were\nsingularly lacking in knowledge of notable celebrities.",
    "III\n\nHercule Poirot caught a bus back to Broadhinny feeling slightly\nmore cheerful.",
    "At any rate there was one person who shared his\nbelief in James Bentleys innocence.",
    "Bentley was not so friendless\nas he had made himself out to be.",
    "His mind went back again to Bentley in prison.",
    "What a dispiriting\ninterview it had been.",
    "There had been no hope aroused hardly a\nstirring of interest.",
    "Thank you Bentley had said dully but I dont suppose there is\nanything anyone can do.",
    "No he was sure he had not got any enemies.",
    "When people barely notice youre alive youre not likely to have\nany enemies.",
    "Your mother Did she have an enemy\n\nCertainly not.",
    "Everyone liked and respected her.",
    "There was a faint indignation in his tone.",
    "What about your friends\n\nAnd James Bentley had said or rather muttered I havent any\nfriends...",
    "But that had not been quite true.",
    "For Maude Williams was a friend.",
    "What a wonderful dispensation it is of Natures thought Hercule\nPoirot that every man however superficially unattractive should\nbe some womans choice.",
    "For all Miss Williamss sexy appearance he had a shrewd\nsuspicion that she was really the maternal type.",
    "She had the qualities that James Bentley lacked the energy the\ndrive the refusal to be beaten the determination to succeed.",
    "He sighed.",
    "What monstrous lies he had told that day Never mind  they were\nnecessary.",
    "For somewhere said Poirot to himself indulging in an absolute\nriot of mixed metaphors there is in the hay a needle and among\nthe sleeping dogs there is one on whom I shall put my foot and by\nshooting the arrows into the air one will come down and hit a\nglasshouse\n\nChapter 7\n\nThe cottage where Mrs McGinty had lived was only a few steps\nfrom the bus stop.",
    "Two children were playing on the doorstep.",
    "One\nwas eating a rather wormylooking apple and the other was\nshouting and beating on the door with a tin tray.",
    "They appeared\nquite happy.",
    "Poirot added to the noise by beating hard on the door himself.",
    "A woman looked round the corner of the house.",
    "She had on a\ncoloured overall and her hair was untidy.",
    "Stop it Ernie she said.",
    "Shant said Ernie and continued.",
    "Poirot deserted the doorstep and made for the corner of the\nhouse.",
    "Cant do anything with children can you the woman said.",
    "Poirot thought you could but forbore to say so.",
    "He was beckoned round to the back door.",
    "I keep the front bolted up sir.",
    "Come in wont you\n\nPoirot passed through a very dirty scullery into an almost more\ndirty kitchen.",
    "She wasnt killed here said the woman.",
    "In the parlour.",
    "Poirot blinked slightly.",
    "Thats what youre down about isnt it Youre the foreign\ngentleman from up at Summerhayes\n\nSo you know all about me said Poirot.",
    "He beamed.",
    "Yes indeed\nMrs \n\n\fKiddle.",
    "My husbands a plasterer.",
    "Moved in four months ago we\ndid.",
    "Been living with Berts mother before...",
    "Some folks said Youd\nnever go into a house where theres been a murder surely  but\nwhat I said was a house is a house and better than a back sittingroom and sleeping on two chairs.",
    "Awful this ousing shortage isnt\nit And anyway weve never been troubled ere.",
    "Always say they\nwalk if theyve been murdered but she doesnt Like to see where\nit happened\n\nFeeling like a tourist being taken on a conducted tour Poirot\nassented.",
    "Mrs Kiddle led him into a small room overburdened with a heavy\nJacobean suite.",
    "Unlike the rest of the house it showed no signs of\never having been occupied.",
    "Down on the floor she was and the back of her head split open.",
    "Didnt half give Mrs Elliot a turn.",
    "Shes the one what found her  she\nand Larkin who comes from the Coop with the bread.",
    "But the\nmoney was took from upstairs.",
    "Come along up and Ill show you\nwhere.",
    "Mrs Kiddle led the way up the staircase and into a bedroom which\ncontained a large chest of drawer a big brass bed some chain\nand a fine assembly of baby clothes wet and dry.",
    "Right here it was said Mrs Kiddle proudly.",
    "Poirot looked round him.",
    "Hard to visualise that this rampant\nstronghold of haphazard fecundity was once the wellscrubbed\ndomain of an elderly woman who was house proud.",
    "Here Mrs\nMcGinty had lived and slept.",
    "I suppose this isnt her furniture\n\nOh no.",

    "She wasnt a\nyoung woman not by any means.",
    "And palpitations shed had to my\ncertain knowledge.",
    "I thought she might have had a stroke.",
    "So I\nhurried over seeing as there were only the two men and naturally\nthey wouldnt like to go into the bedroom.",
    "Poirot accepted this piece of propriety with an assenting murmur.",
    "Hurried up the stairs I did.",
    "He was on the landing pale as death\nhe was.",
    "Not that I ever thought at the time  Well of course then I\ndidnt know what had happened.",

    "III\n\nHercule Poirot walked towards the post office.",
    "The murderer had wanted the money found but he had not wanted\nthe weapon to be found.",
    "For the money would point to James\nBentley and the weapon would point to  whom\n\nHe shook his head.",
    "He had visited the other two cottages.",
    "They\nhad been less exuberant than Mrs Kiddle and less dramatic than\nMrs Elliot.",
    "They had said in effect that Mrs McGinty was a very\nrespectable woman who kept herself to herself that she had a\nniece over at Cullavon that nobody but the said niece ever came\nto see her that nobody so far as they knew disliked her or bore a\n\n\fgrudge against her that was it true that there was a petition being\ngot up for James Bentley and would they be asked to sign it\n\nI get nowhere  nowhere said Poirot to himself.",

    "Superintendent Spence he is a very good and painstaking police\nofficer but me I am Hercule Poirot.",
    "For me there should be\nillumination\n\nOne of his patent leather shoes slopped into a puddle and he\nwinced.",
    "He was the great the unique Hercule Poirot but he was also a\nvery old man and his shoes were tight.",
    "He entered the post office.",
    "The righthand side was given to the business of His Majestys\nmails.",
    "The lefthand side displayed a rich assortment of varied\nmerchandise comprising sweets groceries toys hardware\nstationery\n\nbirthday\n\ncards\n\nknitting\n\nwool\n\nand\n\nchildrens\n\nunderclothes.",
    "Poirot proceeded to a leisurely purchase of stamps.",

    "And twelve pennies said Mrs Sweetiman deftly extracting them\nfrom a large book.",
    "Thats four and tenpence altogether.",

    "Oh no sir Ive really no idea said Mrs Sweetiman in a wholly\nperfunctory manner.",
    "Mrs McGinty said Poirot.",
    "Mrs Sweetiman shook her head.",
    "That was a sad business  a shocking business.",

    "There is a doubt  in some quarters  as to James Bentleys guilt.",
    "Well said Mrs Sweetiman it wouldnt be the first time the police\ngot hold of the wrong man  though I wouldnt say they had in this\ncase.",
    "Not that I should have thought it of him really.",
    "A shy awkward\nsort of fellow but not dangerous or so youd think.",
    "But there you\nnever know do you\n\nPoirot hazarded a request for notepaper.",
    "Of course sir.",
    "Just come across the other side will you\n\nMrs Sweetiman bustled round to take her place behind the lefthand counter.",
    "Whats difficult to imagine is who it could have been if it wasnt Mr\nBentley she remarked as she stretched up to a top shelf for\nnotepaper and envelopes.",
    "We do get some nasty tramps along\nhere sometimes and its possible one of these might have found a\nwindow unfastened and got in that way.",
    "But he wouldnt go leaving\nthe money behind him would he Not after doing murder to get it \n\n\fand pound notes anyway nothing with numbers or marked.",
    "Here\nyou are sir thats a nice blue Bond and envelopes to match.",
    "Poirot made his purchase.",
    "Mrs McGinty never spoke of being nervous of anyone or afraid\ndid she he asked.",
    "Not to me she didnt.",
    "She wasnt a nervous woman.",
    "Shed stay\nlate sometimes at Mr Carpenters  thats Holmeleigh at the top of\nthe hill.",
    "They often have people to dinner and stopping with them\nand Mrs McGinty would go there in the evening sometimes to help\nwash up and shed come down the hill in the dark and thats more\nthan Id like to do.",
    "Very dark it is.",
    "Coming down that hill.",
    "Do you know her niece at all  Mrs Burch\n\nI know her just to speak to.",
    "She and her husband come over\nsometimes.",
    "They inherited a little money when Mrs McGinty died.",
    "The piercing dark eyes looked at him severely.",
    "Well thats natural enough isnt it sir You cant take it with you\nand its only right your own flesh and blood should get it.",
    "Oh yes oh yes I am entirely in agreement.",
    "Was Mrs McGinty fond\nof her niece\n\n\fVery fond of her I think sir.",
    "In a quiet way.",
    "And her nieces husband\n\nAn evasive look appeared in Mrs Sweetimans face.",
    "As far as I know.",
    "When did you see Mrs McGinty last\n\nMrs Sweetiman considered casting her mind back.",
    "Now let me see when was it Edna Edna in the doorway\nsniffed unhelpfully.",
    "Was it the day she died No it was the day\nbefore  or the day before that again Yes it was a Monday.",
    "Thats\nright.",
    "She was killed on the Wednesday.",
    "Yes it was Monday.",
    "She\ncame in to buy a bottle of ink.",
    "She wanted a bottle of ink\n\nExpect she wanted to write a letter said Mrs Sweetiman brightly.",
    "That seems probable.",
    "And she was quite her usual self then She\ndid not seem different in any way\n\nNno I dont think so.",
    "The sniffing Edna shuffled through the door into the shop and\nsuddenly joined in the conversation.",
    "She was different she asserted.",
    "Pleased about something  well\n not pleased quite  excited.",
    "Perhaps youre right said Mrs Sweetiman.",
    "Not that I noticed it\nat the time.",
    "But now that you say so  sort of spry she was.",
    "Do you remember anything she said on that day\n\nI wouldnt ordinarily.",
    "But what with her being murdered and the\npolice and everything it makes things stand out.",
    "She didnt say\nanything about James Bentley that Im quite sure.",
    "Talked about\nthe Carpenters a bit and Mrs Upward  places where she worked\nyou know.",
    "Oh yes I was going to ask you whom exactly she worked for\nhere.",
    "Mrs Sweetiman replied promptly\n\nMondays and Thursdays she went to Mrs Summerhayes at Long\nMeadow.",
    "Thats where you are staying isnt it\n\nYes.",
    "Poirot sighed.",
    "I suppose there is not anywhere else to\nstay\n\nNot right in Broadhinny there isnt.",
    "I suppose you arent very\ncomfortable at Long Meadows Mrs Summerhayes is a nice lady\nbut she doesnt know the first thing about a house.",
    "These ladies\ndont who come back from foreign parts.",
    "Terrible mess there\nalways was there to clean up or so Mrs McGinty used to say.",
    "Yes\n\n\fMonday afternoons and Thursday mornings Mrs Summerhayes\nthen Tuesday mornings Dr Rendells and afternoons Mrs Upward\nat Laburnums.",
    "Wednesday was Mrs Wetherby at Hunters Close\nand Friday Mrs Selkirk  Mrs Carpenter she is now.",
    "Mrs Upwards\nan elderly lady who lives with her son.",
    "Theyve got a maid but\nshes getting on and Mrs McGinty used to go once a week to give\nthings a good turn out.",
    "Mr and Mrs Wetherby never seem to keep\nany help long  shes rather an invalid.",
    "Mr and Mrs Carpenter have\na beautiful home and do a lot of entertaining.",
    "Theyre all very nice\npeople.",
    "It was with this final pronouncement on the population of\nBroadhinny that Poirot went out into the street again.",
    "He walked slowly up the hill towards Long Meadow.",
    "He hoped\ndevoutly that the contents of the bulged tin and the bloodstained\nbeans had been duly eaten for lunch and had not been saved for a\nsupper treat for him.",
    "But possibly there were other doubtful tins.",
    "Life at Long Meadows certainly had its dangers.",
    "It had been on the whole a disappointing day.",
    "What had he learned\n\nThat James Bentley had a friend.",
    "That neither he nor Mrs McGinty\nhad had any enemies.",
    "That Mrs McGinty had looked excited two\ndays before her death and had bought a bottle of ink \n\nPoirot stopped dead... Was that a fact a tiny fact at last\n\n\fHe had asked idly what Mrs McGinty should want with a bottle of\nink and Mrs Sweetiman had replied quite seriously that she\nsupposed she wanted to write a letter...",
    "There was significance there  a significance that had nearly\nescaped him because to him as to most people writing a letter\nwas a common everyday occurrence.",
    "But it was not so to Mrs McGinty.",
    "Writing a letter was to Mrs\nMcGinty such an uncommon occurrence that she had to go out\nand buy a bottle of ink if she wanted to do so.",
    "Mrs McGinty then hardly ever wrote letters.",
    "Mrs Sweetiman who\nwas the postmistress was thoroughly cognisant of that fact.",
    "But\nMrs McGinty had written a letter two days before her death.",
    "To\nwhom had she written and why\n\nIt might be quite unimportant.",
    "She might have written to her niece to an absent friend.",
    "Absurd to lay such stress on a simple thing like\na bottle of ink.",
    "But it was all he had got and he was going to follow it up.",
    "A bottle of ink...\n\nChapter 8\n\n\fA letter Bessie Burch shook her head.",
    "No I didnt get any\nletter from Auntie.",
    "What should she write to me about\n\nPoirot suggested There might have been something she wanted\nto tell you.",
    "Auntie wasnt much of a one for writing.",
    "She was getting on for\nseventy you know and when she was young they didnt get much\nschooling.",
    "But she could read and write\n\nOh of course.",
    "Not much of a one for reading though she liked her\nNews of the World and her Sunday Companion.",
    "But writing came a\nbit difficult always.",
    "If shed anything to let me know about like\nputting us off from coming to see her or saying she couldnt come\nto us shed usually ring up Mr Benson the chemist next door and\nhed send the message in.",
    "Very obliging that way he is.",
    "You see\nwere in the area so it only cost twopence.",
    "Theres a callbox at\nthe post office in Broadhinny.",
    "Poirot nodded.",
    "He appreciated the fact that twopence was better\nthan twopence hapenny.",
    "He already had a picture of Mrs McGinty\nas the spare and saving kind.",
    "She had been he thought very fond\nof money.",
    "He persisted gently\n\nBut your aunt did write to you sometimes I suppose\n\n\fWell there were cards at Xmas.",
    "And perhaps she had friends in other parts of England to whom\nshe wrote\n\nI dont know about that.",
    "There was her sisterinlaw but she died\ntwo years ago and there was a Mrs Birdlip  but shes dead too.",
    "So if she wrote to someone it would be most likely in answer to a\nletter she had received\n\nAgain Bessie Burch looked doubtful.",
    "I dont know whod be writing to her Im sure.",
    "Of course her\nface brightened theres always the Government.",
    "Poirot agreed that in these days communications from what\nBessie loosely referred to as the Government were the rule\nrather than the exception.",
    "And a lot of fandangle it usually is said Mrs Burch.",
    "Forms to fill\nin and a lot of impertinent questions as shouldnt be asked of any\ndecent body.",
    "So Mrs McGinty might have got some Government communication\nthat she had to answer\n\nIf she had shed have brought it along to Joe so as he could help\nher with it.",
    "Those sort of things fussed her and she always brought\nthem to Joe.",
    "Can you remember if there were any letters among her personal\npossessions\n\nI couldnt rightly say.",
    "I dont remember anything.",
    "But then the\npolice took over at first.",
    "It wasnt for quite a while they let me pack\nher things and take them away.",
    "What happened to those things\n\nThat chest over there is hers  good solid mahogany and theres a\nwardrobe upstairs and some good kitchen stuff.",
    "The rest we sold\nbecause wed no room for them.",
    "I meant her own personal things.",
    "He added Such things as\nbrushes and combs photographs toilet things clothes...\n\nOh them.",
    "Well tell you the truth I packed them in a suitcase and\nits still upstairs.",
    "Didnt rightly know what to do with them.",
    "Thought\nId take the clothes to the jumble sale at Xmas but I forgot.",
    "Didnt\nseem nice to take them to one of those nasty secondhand clothes\npeople.",
    "I wonder  might I see the contents of that suitcase\n\nWelcome Im sure.",
    "Though I dont think youll find anything to\nhelp you.",
    "The police went through it all you know.",
    "Oh I know.",
    "But all the same \n\n\fMrs Burch led him briskly into a minute back bedroom used\nPoirot judged mainly for home dressmaking.",
    "She pulled out a\nsuitcase from under the bed and said\n\nWell here you are and youll excuse me stopping but Ive got the\nstew to see to.",
    "Poirot gratefully excused her and heard her thumping downstairs\nagain.",
    "He drew the suitcase towards him and opened it.",
    "A waft of mothballs came out to greet him.",
    "With a feeling of pity he lifted out the contents so eloquent in their\nrevelation of a woman who was dead.",
    "A rather worn long black\ncoat.",
    "Two woollen jumpers.",
    "A coat and skirt.",
    "Stockings.",
    "No\nunderwear presumably Bessie Burch had taken those for her own\nwear.",
    "Two pairs of shoes wrapped up in newspaper.",
    "A brush and\ncomb worn but clean.",
    "An old dented silverbacked mirror.",
    "A\nphotograph in a leather frame of a wedding pair dressed in the\nstyle of thirty years ago  a picture of Mrs McGinty and her\nhusband presumably.",
    "Two picture postcards of Margate.",
    "A china\ndog.",
    "A recipe torn out of a paper for making vegetable marrow\njam.",
    "Another piece dealing with Flying Saucers on a sensational\nnote.",
    "A third clipping dealt with Mother Shiptons prophecies.",
    "There was also a Bible and a Prayer Book.",
    "There were no handbags or gloves.",
    "Presumably Bessie Burch had\ntaken these or given them away.",
    "The clothes here Poirot judged\nwould have been too small for the buxom Bessie.",
    "Mrs McGinty had\nbeen a thin spare woman.",
    "He unwrapped one of the pairs of shoes.",
    "They were of quite good\nquality and not much worn.",
    "Decidedly on the small side for Bessie\nButch.",
    "He was just about to wrap them up neatly again when his eye was\ncaught by the heading on the piece of newspaper.",
    "It was the\nSunday Companion and the date was November 19th.",
    "Mrs McGinty\nhad been killed on November 22nd.",
    "This then was the paper she had bought on the Sunday preceding\nher death.",
    "It had been lying in her room and Bessie Butch had\nused it in due course to wrap up her aunts things.",
    "Sunday November 19th.",
    "And on Monday Mrs McGinty had gone\ninto the post office to buy a bottle of ink...\n\nCould that be because of something she had seen in Sundays\nnewspaper\n\nHe unwrapped the other pair of shoes.",
    "They were wrapped in the\nNews of the World of the same date.",
    "He smoothed out both papers and took them over to a chair where\nhe sat down to read them.",
    "And at once he made a discovery.",
    "On\none page of the Sunday Companion something had been cut out.",
    "It was a rectangular piece out of the middle page.",
    "The space was\ntoo big for any of the clippings he had found.",
    "He looked through both newspapers but could find nothing else of\ninterest.",
    "He wrapped them round the shoes again and packed the\nsuitcase tidily.",
    "Then he went downstairs.",
    "Mrs Burch was busy in the kitchen.",
    "Dont suppose you found anything she said.",
    "Alas no.",
    "He added in a casual voice Do you remember if there\nwas a cutting from a newspaper in your aunts purse or in her\nhandbag was there\n\nCant remember any.",
    "Perhaps the police took it.",
    "But the police had not taken it.",
    "That Poirot knew from his study of\nSpences notes.",
    "The contents of the dead womans handbag had\nbeen listed no newspaper cutting was among them.",
    "Eh bien said Hercule Poirot to himself.",
    "The next step is easy.",
    "It\nwill be either the washout  or else at last I advance.",
    "II\n\nSitting very still with the dusty files of newspaper in front of him\nPoirot told himself that his recognition of the significance of the\nbottle of ink had not played him false.",
    "The Sunday Companion was given to romantic dramatizations of\npast events.",
    "The paper at which Poirot was looking was the Sunday Companion\nof Sunday November 19th.",
    "At the top of the middle page were these words in big type\n\nWomen Victims of Bygone Tragedies\n\nWhere are these women now\n\nBelow the caption were four very blurred reproductions of\nphotographs clearly taken many years ago.",
    "The subjects of them did not look tragic.",
    "They looked actually\nrather ridiculous since nearly all of them were dressed in the style\nof a bygone day and nothing is more ridiculous than the fashions\nof yesterday  though in another thirty years or so their charm may\nhave reappeared or at any rate be once more apparent.",
    "Under each photo was a name.",
    "Eva Kane the other woman in the famous Craig case.",
    "Janice Courtland the tragic wife whose husband was a fiend in\nhuman form.",
    "Little Lily Gamboll tragic child product of our overcrowded age.",
    "Vera Blake unsuspecting wife of a killer.",
    "And then came the question in bold type again\n\nWhere are these women now\n\nPoirot blinked and set himself to read meticulously the somewhat\nromantic prose which gave the life stories of these dim and blurry\nheroines.",
    "The name of Eva Kane he remembered for the Craig Case had\nbeen a very celebrated one.",
    "Alfred Craig had been Town Clerk of\nParminster a conscientious rather nondescript little man correct\nand pleasant in his behaviour.",
    "He had had the misfortune to marry\na tiresome and temperamental wife.",
    "Mrs Craig ran him into debt\nbullied him nagged him and suffered from nervous maladies that\nunkind friends said were entirely imaginary.",
    "Eva Kane was the\nyoung nursery governess in the house.",
    "She was nineteen pretty\nhelpless and rather simple.",
    "She fell desperately in love with Craig\nand he with her.",
    "Then one day the neighbors heard that Mrs Craig\n\n\fhad been ordered abroad for her health.",
    "That had been Craigs\nstory.",
    "He took her up to London the first stage of the journey by\ncar late one evening and saw her off to the South of France.",
    "Then he returned to Parminster and at intervals mentioned how\nhim wifes health was no better by her accounts of it in letters.",
    "Eva\nKane remained behind to housekeep for him and tongues soon\nstarted wagging.",
    "Finally Craig received news of his wifes death\nabroad.",
    "He went away and returned a week later with an account\nof the funeral.",
    "In some ways Craig was a simple man.",
    "He made the mistake of\nmentioning where his wife had died a moderately wellknown\nresort on the French Riviera.",
    "It only remained for someone who\nhad a relative or friend living there to write to them discover that\nthere had been no death or funeral of anyone of that name and\nafter a period of rank gossip to communicate with the police.",
    "Subsequent events can be briefly summarised.",
    "Mrs Craig had not left for the Riviera.",
    "She had been cut in neat\npieces and buried in the Craig cellar.",
    "And the autopsy of the\nremains showed poisoning by a vegetable alkaloid.",
    "Craig was arrested and sent for trial.",
    "Eva Kane was originally\ncharged as an accessory but the charge was dropped since it\nappeared clear that she had throughout been completely ignorant\nof what had occurred.",
    "Craig in the end made a full confession and\nwas sentenced and executed.",
    "Eva Kane who was expecting a child left Parminster and in the\nwords of the Sunday Companion Kindly relatives in the New World\noffered her a home.",
    "Changing her name the pitiful young girl\nseduced in her trusting youth by a coldblooded murderer left\nthese shores for ever to begin a new life and to keep for ever\nlocked in her heart and concealed from her daughter the name of\nher father.",

    "Where is she now Is there in some Midwestern\ntown an elderly woman quiet and respected by her neighbours\nwho has perhaps sad eyes... And does a young woman happy\nand cheerful with children perhaps of her own come and see\nMomma telling her of all the little rubs and grievances of daily\nlife  with no idea of what past sufferings her mother has endured\n\nOh la la said Hercule Poirot.",
    "And passed on to the next Tragic\nVictim.",
    "Janice Courtland the tragic wife had certainly been unfortunate\nin her husband.",
    "His peculiar practices referred to in such a\nguarded way as to rouse instant curiosity had been suffered by\nher for eight years.",
    "Eight years of martyrdom the Sunday\nCompanion said firmly.",
    "Then Janice made a friend.",
    "An idealistic\nand unworldly young man who horrified by a scene between\nhusband and wife that he had witnessed by accident had\n\n\fthereupon assaulted the husband with such vigour that the latter\nhad crashed in his skull on a sharplyedged marble fire surround.",
    "The jury had found that provocation had been intense that the\nyoung idealist had had no intention of killing and a sentence of five\nyears for manslaughter was given.",
    "The suffering Janice horrified by all the publicity the case had\nbrought her had gone abroad to forget.",
    "Has she forgotten asked the Sunday Companion.",
    "We hope so.",
    "Somewhere perhaps is a happy wife and mother to whom those\nyears of nightmare suffering silently endured seem now only like a\ndream...\n\nWell well said Hercule Poirot and passed on to Lily Gamboll the\ntragic child product of our overcrowded age.",

    "The aunt though\nautocratic was small and frail.",
    "The blow killed her.",
    "Lily was a welldeveloped and muscular child for her twelve years.",
    "An approved\nschool had opened its doors and Lily had disappeared from the\neveryday scene.",
    "By now she is a woman free again to take her place in our\ncivilization.",
    "Her conduct during her years of confinement and\nprobation is said to have been exemplary.",
    "Does not this show that\n\n\fit is not the child but the system that we must blame Brought up\nin ignorance in slum conditions little Lily was the victim of her\nenvironment.",
    "Now having atoned for her tragic lapse she lives somewhere\nhappily we hope a good citizen and a good wife and mother.",
    "Poor\nlittle Lily Gamboll.",
    "Poirot shook his head.",
    "A child of twelve who took a swing at her\naunt with a meat chopper and hit her hard enough to kill her was\nnot in his opinion a nice child.",
    "His sympathies were in this case\nwith the aunt.",
    "He passed on to Vera Blake.",
    "Vera Blake was clearly one of those women with whom everything\ngoes wrong.",
    "She had first taken up with a boyfriend who turned\nout to be a gangster wanted by the police for killing a bank\nwatchman.",
    "She had then married a respectable tradesman who\nturned out to be a receiver of stolen goods.",
    "Her two children had\nlikewise in due course attracted the attention of the police.",
    "They\nwent with mamma to department stores and did a pretty line in\nshoplifting.",
    "Finally however a good man had appeared on the\nscene.",
    "He had offered tragic Vera a home in the Dominions.",
    "She\nand her children should leave this effete country.",
    "From henceforward a New Life awaited them.",
    "At last after long\nyears of repeated blows from Fate Veras troubles are over.",
    "I wonder said Poirot sceptically.",
    "Very possibly she will find she\nhas married a confidence trickster who works the liners\n\nHe leant back and studied the four photographs.",
    "Eva Kane with\ntousled curly hair over her ears and an enormous hat held a\nbunch of roses up to her ear like a telephone receiver.",

    "For some reason Mrs McGinty had torn out this feature\nphotographs and all.",
    "Why Just to keep because the stories\ninterested her He thought not.",
    "Mrs McGinty had kept very few\nthings during her sixtyodd years of life.",
    "Poirot knew that from the\npolice reports of her belongings.",
    "She had torn this out on the Sunday and on the Monday she had\nbought a bottle of ink and the inference was that she who never\nwrote letters was about to write a letter.",
    "If it had been a business\nletter she would probably have asked Joe Burch to help her.",
    "So it\nhad not been business.",
    "It had been  what\n\nPoirots eye looked over the four photographs once again.",
    "Where the Sunday Companion asked are these women now\n\nOne of them Poirot thought might have been in Broadhinny last\nNovember.",
    "III\n\nIt was not until the following day that Poirot found himself t\u00eate \u00e0\nt\u00eate with Miss Pamela Horsefall.",
    "Miss Horsefall couldnt give him long because she had to rush\naway to Sheffield she explained.",
    "Miss Horsefall was tall manlylooking a hard drinker and smoker\nand it would seem looking at her highly improbable that it was her\npen which had dropped such treacly sentiment in the Sunday\nCompanion.",
    "Nevertheless it was so.",
    "Cough it up cough it up said Miss Horsefall impatiently to\nPoirot.",
    "We got to be going.",
    "It is about your article in the Sunday Companion.",
    "Last November.",
    "The series about Tragic Women.",
    "Oh that series.",
    "Pretty lousy werent they\n\nPoirot did not express an opinion on that point.",
    "He said\n\nI refer in particular to the article on Women Associated with\nCrime that appeared on November 19th.",
    "It concerned Eva Kane\nVera Blake Janice Courtland and Lily Gamboll.",
    "Miss Horsefall grinned.",
    "Where are these tragic women now I remember.",
    "I suppose you sometimes get letters after the appearance of\nthese articles\n\nYou bet I do Some people seem to have nothing better to do than\nwrite letters.",
    "Somebody once saw the murderer Craig walking\ndown the street.",
    "Somebody would like to tell me the story of her\nlife far more tragic than anything I could ever imagine.",
    "Did you get a letter after the appearance of that article from a Mrs\nMcGinty of Broadhinny\n\nMy dear man how on earth should I know I get buckets of\nletters.",
    "How should I remember one particular name\n\nI thought you might remember said Poirot because a few days\nlater Mrs McGinty was murdered.",
    "Now youre talking.",
    "Miss Horsefall forgot to be impatient to get to\nSheffield and sat down astride a chair.",
    "McGinty  McGinty...",
    "I do\nremember the name.",
    "Conked on the head by her lodger.",
    "Not a very\nexciting crime from the point of view of the public.",
    "No sex appeal\nabout it.",
    "You say the woman wrote to me\n\nShe wrote to the Sunday Companion I think.",
    "Same thing.",
    "It would come on to me.",
    "And with the murder  and\nher name being in the news  surely I should remember  She\nstopped.",
    "Look here  it wasnt from Broadhinny.",
    "It was from\nBroadway.",
    "So you do remember\n\nWell Im not sure...",
    "But the name...",
    "Comic name isnt it McGinty\nYes  atrocious writing and quite illiterate.",
    "If Id only realised...",
    "But\nIm sure it came from Broadway.",
    "Poirot said You say yourself the writing was bad.",
    "Broadway and\nBroadhinny  they could look alike.",
    "Yes  might be so.",
    "After all one wouldnt be likely to know these\nqueer rural names.",
    "McGinty  yes.",
    "I do remember definitely.",
    "Perhaps the murder fixed the name for me.",
    "Can you remember what she said in her letter\n\nSomething about a photograph.",
    "She knew where there was a\nphotograph like in the paper  and would we pay her anything for it\nand how much\n\nAnd you answered\n\nMy dear man we dont want anything of that kind.",
    "We sent back\nthe standard reply.",
    "Polite thanks but nothing doing.",
    "But as we sent\nit to Broadway  I dont suppose shed ever get it.",
    "She knew where there was a photograph...",
    "Into Poirots mind there came back a remembrance.",
    "Maureen\nSummerhayes careless voice saying Of course she snooped\nround a bit.",
    "Mrs McGinty had snooped.",
    "She was honest but she liked to know\nabout things.",
    "And people kept things  foolish meaningless things\nfrom the past.",
    "Kept them for sentimental reasons or just\noverlooked them and didnt remember they were there.",
    "Mrs McGinty had seen an old photograph and later she had\nrecognised it reproduced in the Sunday Companion.",
    "And she had\nwondered if there was any money in it...",
    "He rose briskly.",
    "Thank you Miss Horsefall.",
    "You will pardon me\nbut those notes on the cases that you wrote were they accurate I\nnotice for instance that the year of the Craig trial is given wrongly\n it was actually a year later than you say.",
    "And in the Courtland\ncase the husbands name was Herbert I seem to remember not\nHubert.",
    "Lily Gambolls aunt lived in Buckinghamshire not\nBerkshire.",
    "Miss Horsefall waved a cigarette.",
    "My dear man.",
    "No point in accuracy.",
    "Whole thing was a romantic\nfarrago from beginning to end.",
    "I just mugged up the facts a bit and\nthen let fly with a lot of hou ha.",
    "What I am trying to say is that even the characters of your\nheroines are not perhaps quite as represented.",
    "Pamela let out a neighing sound like a horse.",
    "Course they werent.",
    "What do you think Ive no doubt that Eva\nKane was a thorough little bitch and not an injured innocent at all.",
    "And as for the Courtland woman why did she suffer in silence for\neight years with a sadistic pervert Because he was rolling in\nmoney and the romantic friend hadnt any.",
    "And the tragic child Lily Gamboll\n\nI wouldnt care to have her gambolling about me with a meat\nchopper.",
    "Poirot ticked off on his fingers.",
    "They left the country  they went to the New World  abroad  to\nthe Dominions  to start a New Life.",
    "And there is nothing to show\nis there that they did not subsequently come back to this\ncountry\n\nNot a thing agreed Miss Horsefall.",
    "And now  I really must fly \n\nLater that night Poirot rang up Spence.",
    "Ive been wondering about you Poirot.",
    "Have you got anything\nAnything at all\n\n\fI have made my inquiries said Poirot grimly.",
    "Yes\n\nAnd the result of them is this The people who live in Broadhinny\nare all very nice people.",
    "What do you mean by that M. Poirot\n\nOh my friend consider.",
    "Very nice people.",
    "That has been before\nnow a motive for murder.",
    "Chapter 9\n\nAll very nice people murmured Poirot as he turned in at the gate\nof Crossways near the station.",
    "A brass plate in the doorpost announced that Dr Rendell M.D.",
    "lived there.",
    "Dr Rendell was a large cheerful man of forty.",
    "He greeted his guest\nwith definite empressement.",
    "Our quiet little village is honoured he said by the presence of\nthe great Hercule Poirot.",
    "Ah said Poirot.",
    "He was gratified.",
    "You have then heard of me\n\n\fOf course we have heard of you.",
    "Who hasnt\n\nThe answer to that would have been damaging to Poirots selfesteem.",
    "He merely said politely I am fortunate to find you at\nhome.",
    "It was not particularly fortunate.",
    "It was on the contrary astute\ntiming.",
    "But Dr Rendell replied heartily\n\nYes.",
    "Just caught me.",
    "Surgery in a quarter of an hour.",
    "Now what\ncan I do for you Im devoured with curiosity to know what youre\ndoing down here.",
    "A rest cure Or have we crime in our midst\n\nIn the past tense  not the present.",
    "Past I dont remember \n\nMrs McGinty.",
    "Of course.",
    "Of course.",
    "I was forgetting.",
    "But dont say youre\nconcerned with that  at this late date\n\nIf I may mention this to you in confidence I am employed by the\ndefence.",
    "Fresh evidence on which to lodge an appeal.",
    "Dr Rendell said sharply But what fresh evidence can there be\n\nThat alas I am not at liberty to state \n\nOh quite  please forgive me.",
    "But I have come across certain things which are I may say  very\ncurious  very  how shall I put it  suggestive I came to you Dr\nRendell because I understand that Mrs McGinty occasionally was\nemployed here.",
    "Oh yes yes  she was  What about a drink Sherry Whisky You\nprefer sherry So do I.",
    "He brought two glasses and sitting down\nby Poirot he went on She used to come once a week to do extra\ncleaning.",

    "Mrs McGinty was an excellent\nworker.",
    "Do you think that she was a truthful person\n\nTruthful Well thats an odd question.",
    "I dont think I could say  no\nopportunity of knowing.",
    "As far as I know she was quite truthful.",
    "If then she made a statement to anyone you think that statement\nwould probably be true\n\nDr Rendell looked faintly disturbed.",
    "Oh I wouldnt like to go as far as that.",
    "I really know so little about\nher.",
    "I could ask Mrs Scott.",
    "Shed know better.",
    "No no.",
    "It would be better not to do that.",
    "Youre arousing my curiosity said Dr Rendell genially.",
    "What\nwas it she was going around saying Something a bit libellous was\nit Slanderous I suppose I mean.",
    "Poirot merely shook his head.",
    "He said You understand all this is\nextremely hush hush at present.",
    "I am only at the very\ncommencement of my investigation.",
    "Dr Rendell said rather drily\n\nYoull have to hurry a bit wont you\n\nYou are right.",
    "The time at my disposal is short.",
    "I must say you surprise me... Weve all been quite sure down here\nthat Bentley did it.",
    "There didnt seem any doubt possible.",
    "It seemed an ordinary sordid crime  not very interesting.",
    "That is\nwhat you would say\n\nYes  yes that sums it up very fairly.",
    "You knew James Bentley\n\nHe came to see me professionally once or twice.",
    "He was nervous\nabout his own health.",
    "Coddled by his mother I fancy.",
    "One sees\nthat so often.",

    "Youre staying there I understand\n\nI am said Poirot without undue elation.",
    "Dr Rendell appeared amused.",
    "Guest House indeed he said.",
    "What that young woman knows\nabout running a Guest House is just nothing at all.",
    "Shes lived in\nIndia all her married life with servants running round all over the\nplace.",
    "I bet youre uncomfortable.",
    "Nobody ever stays long.",

    "I am not so sure.",
    "He left the room quickly.",
    "As he went down the stairs the girl came\nafter him.",
    "She caught up with him in the hall.",
    "What do you mean she asked.",
    "What I said mademoiselle.",
    "Yes but... She stopped.",
    "Poirot said nothing.",
    "Deirdre Henderson said slowly\n\nYouve upset my mother.",
    "She hates things like that  robberies\nand murders and  and violence.",
    "It must then have been a great shock to her when a woman who\nhad actually worked here was killed.",
    "Oh yes  oh yes it was.",
    "She was prostrated  yes\n\nShe wouldnt hear anything about it... We  I  we try to  to spare\nher things.",
    "All the beastliness.",
    "What about the war\n\nLuckily we never had any bombs near here.",
    "What was your part in the war mademoiselle\n\nOh I did V.A.D.",
    "work in Kilchester.",
    "And some driving for the\nW.V.S.",
    "I couldnt have left home of course.",
    "Mother needed me.",
    "As\nit was she minded my being out so much.",
    "It was all very difficult.",
    "And then servants  naturally mothers never done any housework shes not strong enough.",
    "And it was so difficult to get anyone at all.",
    "Thats why Mrs McGinty was such a blessing.",
    "Thats when she\nbegan coming to us.",
    "She was a splendid worker.",
    "But of course\nnothing  anywhere  is like it used to be.",
    "And do you mind that so much mademoiselle\n\nI Oh no.",
    "She seemed surprised.",
    "But its different for mother.",
    "She  she lives in the past a lot.",
    "Some people do said Poirot.",
    "His visual memory conjured up the\nroom he had been in a short time before.",
    "There had been a bureau\ndrawer half pulled out.",
    "A drawer full of odds and ends  silk pincushion a broken fan a silver coffee pot  some old magazines.",
    "The drawer had been too full to shut.",
    "He said softly And they\nkeep things  memories of old days  the dance programme the\nfan the photographs of bygone friends even the menu cards and\nthe theatre programmes because looking at these things old\nmemories revive.",
    "I suppose thats it said Deirdre.",
    "I cant understand it myself.",
    "I\nnever keep anything.",
    "You look forwards not back\n\nDeirdre said slowly\n\nI dont know that I look anywhere...",
    "I mean todays usually\nenough isnt it\n\nThe front door opened and a tall spare elderly man came into the\nhall.",
    "He stopped dead as he saw Poirot.",
    "He glanced at Deirdre and his eyebrows rose in interrogation.",
    "This is my stepfather said Deirdre.",
    "I  I dont know your name\n\nI am Hercule Poirot said Poirot with his usual embarrassed air of\nannouncing a royal title.",
    "Mr Wetherby seemed unimpressed.",
    "He said Ah and turned to hang up his coat.",
    "Deirdre said\n\nHe came to ask about Mrs McGinty.",
    "Mr Wetherby remained still for a second then he finished his\nadjustment of the coat on the peg.",
    "That seems to me rather remarkable he said.",
    "The woman met\nher death some months ago and although she worked here we\nhave no information concerning her or her family.",
    "If we had done\nwe should already have given it to the police.",
    "There was finality in his tone.",
    "He glanced at his watch.",
    "Lunch I presume will be ready in a quarter of an hour.",
    "Im afraid it may be rather late today.",
    "Mr Wetherbys eyebrows rose again.",
    "Indeed Why may I ask\n\nFrieda has been rather busy.",
    "My dear Deirdre I hate to remind you but the task of running the\nhousehold devolves on you.",
    "I should appreciate a little more\npunctuality.",
    "Poirot opened the front door and let himself out.",
    "He glanced over\nhis shoulder.",
    "There was cold dislike in the gaze that Mr Wetherby gave his\nstepdaughter.",
    "There was something very like hate in the eyes that\nlooked back at him.",
    "Chapter 10\n\nPoirot left his third call until after luncheon.",
    "Luncheon was understewed oxtail watery potatoes and what Maureen hoped\noptimistically might turn out to be pancakes.",
    "They were very\npeculiar.",
    "Poirot walked slowly up the hill.",
    "Presently on his right he would\ncome to Laburnums two cottages knocked into one and\nremodelled to modern taste.",
    "Here lived Mrs Upward and that\npromising young playwright Robin Upward.",
    "Poirot paused a moment at the gate to pass a hand over his\nmoustaches.",
    "As he did so a car came twisting slowly down the hill\nand an apple core directed with force struck him on the cheek.",
    "Startled Poirot let out a yelp of protest.",
    "The car halted and a head\ncame through the window.",
    "Im so sorry.",
    "Did I hit you\n\nPoirot paused in the act of replying.",
    "He looked at the rather noble\nface the massive brow the untidy billows of grey hair and a chord\nof memory stirred.",
    "The apple core too assisted his memory.",
    "But surely he exclaimed it is Mrs Oliver.",
    "It was indeed that celebrated detectivestory writer.",
    "Exclaiming Why its M. Poirot the authoress attempted to\nextract herself from the car.",
    "It was a small car and Mrs Oliver was\na large woman.",
    "Poirot hastened to assist.",
    "Murmuring in an explanatory voice Stiff after the long drive Mrs\nOliver suddenly arrived out on the road rather in the manner of a\nvolcanic eruption.",
    "Large quantities of apples came too and rolled merrily down the\nhill.",
    "Bags burst explained Mrs Oliver.",
    "She brushed a few stray pieces of halfconsumed apple\n\nfrom the jutting shelf of her bust and then shook herself rather like\na large Newfoundland dog.",
    "A last apple concealed in the recesses\nof her person joined its brothers and sisters.",
    "Pity the bag burst said Mrs Oliver.",
    "They were Coxs.",
    "Still I\nsuppose there will be lots of apples down here in the country.",
    "Or\narent there Perhaps they all get sent away.",
    "Things are so odd\nnowadays I find.",
    "Well how are you M. Poirot You dont live here\ndo you No Im sure you dont.",
    "Then I suppose its murder Not my\nhostess I hope\n\nWho is your hostess\n\n\fIn there said Mrs Oliver nodding her head.",
    "Thats to say if\nthats a house called Laburnums halfway down the hill on the left\nafter you pass the church.",
    "Yes that must be it.",
    "Whats she like\n\nYou do not know her\n\nNo Ive come down professionally so to speak.",
    "A book of mine is\nbeing dramatised  by Robin Upward.",
    "Were supposed to sort of\nget together over it.",
    "My felicitations madame.",
    "Its not like that at all said Mrs Oliver.",
    "So far its pure agony.",
    "Why I ever let myself in for it I dont know.",
    "My books bring me in\nquite enough money  that is to say the bloodsuckers take most of\nit and if I made more theyd take more so I dont overstrain\nmyself.",
    "But youve no idea of the agony of having your characters\ntaken and made to say things that they never would have said and\ndo things that they never would have done.",
    "And if you protest all\nthey say is that its good theatre.",
    "Thats all Robin Upward thinks\nof.",
    "Everyone says hes very clever.",
    "If hes so clever I dont see why\nhe doesnt write a play of his own and leave my poor unfortunate\nFinn alone.",
    "Hes not even a Finn any longer.",
    "Hes become a\nmember of the Norwegian Resistance movement.",
    "She ran her\nhands through her hair.",
    "What have I done with my hat\n\nPoirot looked into the car.",
    "I think madame that you must have been sitting on it.",
    "It does look like it agreed Mrs Oliver surveying the wreckage.",
    "Oh well she continued cheerfully I never mind it much.",
    "But I\nthought I might have to go to church on Sunday and although the\nArchbishop has said one neednt I still think that the more oldfashioned clergy expect one to wear a hat.",
    "But tell me about your\nmurder or whatever it is.",
    "Do you remember our murder\n\nVery well indeed.",
    "Rather fun wasnt it Not the actual murder  I didnt like that at\nall.",
    "But afterwards.",
    "Who is it this time\n\nNot so picturesque a person as Mr Shaitana.",
    "An elderly\ncharwoman who was robbed and murdered five months ago.",
    "You\nmay have read about it.",
    "Mrs McGinty.",
    "A young man was convicted\nand sentenced to death \n\nAnd he didnt do it but you know who did and youre going to\nprove it said Mrs Oliver rapidly.",
    "Splendid.",
    "You go too fast said Poirot with a sigh.",
    "I do not yet know who\ndid it  and from there it will be a long way to prove it.",
    "Men are so slow said Mrs Oliver disparagingly.",
    "Ill soon tell you\nwho did it.",
    "Someone down here I suppose Give me a day or two\nto look round and Ill spot the murderer.",
    "A womans intuition thats what you need.",
    "I was quite right over the Shaitana case\nwasnt I\n\n\fPoirot gallantly forebore to remind Mrs Oliver of her rapid changes\nof suspicion on that occasion.",
    "You men said Mrs Oliver indulgently.",
    "Now if a woman were the\nhead of Scotland Yard \n\nShe left this well worn theme hanging in the air as a voice hailed\nthem from the door of the cottage.",
    "Hullo said the voice an agreeable light tenor.",
    "Is that Mrs\nOliver\n\nHere I am called Mrs Oliver.",
    "To Poirot she murmured Dont\nworry.",
    "Ill be very discreet.",
    "No no madame.",
    "I do not want you to be discreet.",
    "On the\ncontrary.",
    "Robin Upward came down the path and through the gate.",
    "He was bareheaded and wore very old grey flannel trousers and a\ndisreputable sports coat.",
    "But for a tendency to embonpoint he\nwould have been good looking.",
    "Ariadne my precious he exclaimed and embraced her warmly.",
    "He stood away his hands on her shoulders.",
    "My dear Ive had the most marvelous idea for the second act.",
    "Have you said Mm.",
    "Oliver without enthusiasm.",
    "This is M.\nHercule Poirot.",
    "Splendid said Robin.",
    "Have you got any luggage\n\nYes its in the back.",
    "Robin hauled out a couple of suitcases.",
    "Such a bore he said.",
    "Weve no proper servants.",
    "Only old Janet.",
    "And we have to spare her all the time.",
    "Thats such a nuisance dont\nyou think How heavy your cases are.",
    "Have you got bombs in\nthem\n\nHe staggered up the path calling out over his shoulder\n\nCome in and have a drink.",
    "He means you said Mrs Oliver removing her handbag a book\nand a pair of old shoes from the front seat.",
    "Did you actually say\njust now that you wanted me to be indiscreet\n\nThe more indiscreet the better.",
    "I shouldnt tackle it that way myself said Mrs Oliver but its\nyour murder.",
    "Ill help all I can.",
    "Robin reappeared at the front door.",
    "Come in come in he called.",
    "Well see about the car later.",
    "Madre is dying to meet you.",
    "Mrs Oliver swept up the path and Hercule Poirot followed her.",
    "The interior of Laburnums was charming.",
    "Poirot guessed that a\nvery large sum of money had been spent on it but the result was\nan expensive and charming simplicity.",
    "Each small piece of cottage\noak was a genuine piece.",
    "In a wheeled chair by the fireplace of the livingroom Laura\nUpward smiled a welcome.",
    "She was a vigorouslooking woman of\nsixtyodd with irongrey hair and a determined chin.",
    "Im delighted to meet you Mrs Oliver she said.",
    "I expect you\nhate people talking to you about your books but theyve been an\nenormous solace to me for years  and especially since Ive been\nsuch a cripple.",
    "Thats very nice of you said Mrs Oliver looking uncomfortable\nand twisting her hands in a schoolgirlish way.",
    "Oh this is M. Poirot a old friend of mine.",
    "We met by chance just\noutside here.",
    "Actually I hit him with an apple core.",
    "Like William Tell\n only the other way about.",
    "How dyou do M. Poirot.",
    "Robin.",
    "Yes Madre\n\n\fGet some drinks.",
    "Where are the cigarettes\n\nOn that table.",
    "Mrs Upward asked Are you a writer too M. Poirot\n\nOh no said Mrs Oliver.",
    "Hes a detective.",
    "You know.",
    "The\nSherlock Holmes kind  deerstalkers and violins and all that.",
    "And\nhes come here to solve a murder.",
    "There was a faint tinkle of broken glass.",
    "Mrs Upward said sharply\nRobin do be careful.",
    "To Poirot she said Thats very interesting\nM. Poirot.",
    "So Maureen Summerhayes was right exclaimed Robin.",
    "She told\nme some long rigmarole about having a detective on the premises.",
    "She seemed to think it frightfully funny.",
    "But its really quite serious\nisnt it\n\nOf course its serious said Mrs Oliver.",
    "Youve got a criminal in\nyour midst.",
    "Yes but look here whos been murdered Or is it someone thats\nbeen dug up and its all frightfully hush hush\n\nIt is not hush hush said Poirot.",
    "The murder you know about it\nalready.",
    "Mrs Mc  something  a charwoman  last autumn said Mrs\nOliver.",
    "Oh Robin Upward sounded disappointed.",
    "But thats all over.",
    "Its not over at all said Mrs Oliver.",
    "They arrested the wrong\nman and hell be hanged if M. Poirot doesnt find the real murderer\nin time.",
    "Its all frightfully exciting.",
    "Robin apportioned the drinks.",
    "White Lady for you Madre.",
    "Thank you my dear boy.",
    "Poirot frowned slightly.",
    "Robin handed drinks to Mrs Oliver and to\nhim.",
    "Well said Robin heres to crime.",
    "He drank.",
    "She used to work here he said.",
    "Mrs McGinty asked Mrs Oliver.",
    "Yes.",
    "Didnt she Madre\n\nWhen you say work here she came one day a week.",
    "And odd afternoons sometimes.",
    "What was she like asked Mrs Oliver.",
    "Terribly respectable said Robin.",
    "And maddeningly tidy.",
    "She\nhad a ghastly way of tidying up everything and putting things into\ndrawers so that you simply couldnt guess where they were.",
    "Mrs Upward said with a certain grim humour\n\nIf somebody didnt tidy things away at least one day a week you\nsoon wouldnt be able to move in this small house.",
    "I know Madre I know.",
    "But unless things are left where I put them\nI simply cant work at all.",
    "My notes get all disarranged.",
    "Its annoying to be as helpless as I am said Mrs Upward.",
    "We\nhave a faithful old maid but its all she can manage just to do a\nlittle simple cooking.",
    "What is it asked Mrs Oliver.",
    "Arthritis\n\nSome form of it.",
    "I shall have to have a permanent nursecompanion\n\nsoon\n\nIm\n\nafraid.",
    "Such\n\na\n\nbore.",
    "independent.",
    "Now darling said Robin.",
    "Dont work yourself up.",
    "He patted her arm.",
    "She smiled at him with sudden tenderness.",
    "I\n\nlike\n\nbeing\n\n\fRobins as good as a daughter to me she said.",
    "He does\neverything  and thinks of everything.",
    "No one could be more\nconsiderate.",
    "They smiled at each other.",
    "Hercule Poirot rose.",
    "Alas he said.",
    "I must go.",
    "I have another call to make and then a\ntrain to catch.",
    "Madame I thank you for your hospitality.",
    "Mr\nUpward I wish all success to the play.",
    "And all success to you with your murder said Mrs Oliver.",
    "Is this really serious M. Poirot asked Robin Upward.",
    "Or is it a\nterrific hoax\n\nOf course it isnt a hoax said Mrs Oliver.",
    "Its deadly serious.",
    "He\nwont tell me who the murderer is but he knows dont you\n\nNo\n\nno\n\nmadame\n\nPoirots\n\nprotest\n\nwas\n\njust\n\nsufficiently\n\nunconvincing.",
    "I told you that as yet no I do not know.",
    "Thats what you said but I think you do know really.",
    "But youre so\nfrightfully secretive arent you\n\nMrs Upward said sharply\n\nIs this really true Its not a joke\n\n\fIt is not a joke madame said Poirot.",
    "He bowed and departed.",
    "As he went down the path he heard Robin Upwards clear tenor\nvoice\n\nBut Ariadne darling he said its all very well but with that\nmoustache and everything how can one take him seriously Do\nyou really mean hes good\n\nPoirot smiled to himself.",
    "Good indeed\n\nAbout to cross the narrow lane he jumped back just in time.",
    "The Summerhayes station wagon lurching and bumping came\nracing past him.",
    "Summerhayes was driving.",
    "Sorry he called.",
    "Got to catch train.",
    "And faintly from the\ndistance Covent Garden...\n\nPoirot also intended to take a train  the local train to Kilchester\nwhere he had arranged a conference with Superintendent Spence.",
    "He had time before catching it for just one last call.",
    "He went to the top of the hill and through gates and up a wellkept\ndrive to a modern house of frosted concrete with a square roof and\na good deal of window.",
    "This was the home of Mr and Mrs\nCarpenter.",
    "Guy Carpenter was a partner in the big Carpenter\n\n\fEngineering Works  a very rich man who had recently taken to\npolitics.",
    "He and his wife had only been married a short time.",
    "The Carpenters front door was not opened by foreign help or an\naged faithful.",
    "An imperturbable manservant opened the door and\nwas loath to admit Hercule Poirot.",
    "In his view Hercule Poirot was\nthe kind of caller who is left outside.",
    "He clearly suspected that\nHercule Poirot had come to sell something.",
    "Mr and Mrs Carpenter are not at home.",
    "Perhaps then I might wait\n\nI couldnt say when they will be in.",
    "He closed the door.",
    "Poirot did not go down the drive.",
    "Instead he walked round the\ncorner of the house and almost collided with a tall young woman in\na mink coat.",
    "Hullo she said.",
    "What the hell do you want\n\nPoirot raised his hat with gallantry.",
    "I was hoping he said that I could see Mr or Mrs Carpenter.",
    "Have I the pleasure of seeing Mrs Carpenter\n\nIm Mrs Carpenter.",
    "She spoke ungraciously but there was a faint suggestion of\nappeasement behind her manner.",
    "My name is Hercule Poirot.",
    "Nothing registered.",
    "Not only was the great the unique name\nunknown to her but he thought that she did not even identify him\nas Maureen Summerhayes latest guest.",
    "Here then the local\ngrape vine did not operate.",
    "A small but significant fact perhaps.",
    "Yes\n\nI demand to see either Mr or Mrs Carpenter but you madame\nwill be the best for my purpose.",
    "For what I have to ask is of\ndomestic matters.",
    "Weve got a Hoover said Mrs Carpenter suspiciously.",
    "Poirot laughed.",
    "No no you misunderstand.",
    "It is only a few questions that I ask\nabout a domestic matter.",
    "Oh you mean one of these domestic questionnaires.",
    "I do think its\nabsolutely idiotic  She broke off.",
    "Perhaps youd better come\ninside.",
    "Poirot smiled faintly.",
    "She had just stopped herself from uttering a\nderogatory comment.",
    "With her husbands political activities\ncaution in criticising Government activities was indicated.",
    "She led the way through the hall and into a goodsized room giving\non to a carefully tended garden.",
    "It was a very newlooking room a\nlarge brocaded suite of sofa and two wingchairs three or four\nreproductions of Chippendale chairs a bureau a writing desk.",
    "No\nexpense had been spared the best firms had been employed and\nthere was absolutely no sign of individual taste.",
    "The bride Poirot\nthought had been what Indifferent Careful\n\nHe looked at her appraisingly as she turned.",
    "An expensive and\ngoodlooking young woman.",
    "Platinum blonde hair carefully\napplied makeup but something more  wide cornflower blue eyes\n eyes with a wide frozen stare in them  beautiful drowned eyes.",
    "She said  graciously now but concealing boredom\n\nDo sit down.",
    "He sat.",
    "He said\n\nYou are most amiable madame.",
    "These questions now that I wish\nto ask you.",
    "They relate to a Mrs McGinty who died  was killed that\nis to say  last November.",
    "Mrs McGinty I dont know what you mean\n\nShe was glaring at him.",
    "Her eyes hard and suspicions.",
    "You remember Mrs McGinty\n\n\fNo I dont.",
    "I dont know anything about her.",
    "You remember her murder Or is murder so common here that\nyou do not even notice it\n\nOh the murder Yes of course.",
    "Id forgotten what the old\nwomans name was.",
    "Although she worked for you in this house\n\nShe didnt.",
    "I wasnt living here then.",
    "Mr Carpenter and I were only\nmarried three months ago.",
    "But she did work for you.",
    "On Friday mornings I think it was.",
    "You\nwere then Mrs Selkirk and you lived in Rose Cottage.",
    "She said sulkily\n\nIf you know the answers to everything I dont see why you need to\nask questions.",
    "Anyway whats it all about\n\nI am making an investigation into the circumstance of the\nmurder.",
    "Why What on earth for Anyway why come to me\n\nYou might know something  that would help me.",
    "I dont know anything at all.",
    "Why should I She was only a stupid\nold charwoman.",
    "She kept her money under the floor and\n\n\fsomebody robbed and murdered her for it.",
    "It was quite disgusting beastly the whole thing.",
    "Like things you read in the Sunday\npapers.",
    "Poirot took that up quickly.",
    "Like the Sunday papers yes.",
    "Like the Sunday Companion.",
    "You\nread perhaps the Sunday Companion\n\nShe jumped up and made her way blunderingly towards the\nopened french windows.",
    "So uncertainly did she go that she\nactually collided with the window frame.",
    "Poirot was reminded of a\nbeautiful big moth fluttering blindly against a lamp shade.",
    "She called Guy  Guy\n\nA mans voice a little way away answered\n\nEve\n\nCome here quickly.",
    "A tall man of about thirtyfive came into sight.",
    "He quickened his\npace and came across the terrace to the window.",
    "Eve Carpenter\nsaid vehemently\n\nTheres a man here  a foreigner.",
    "Hes asking me all sorts of\nquestions\n\nabout\n\nthat horrid murder last year.",
    "Some old\n\ncharwoman  you remember I hate things like that.",
    "You know I\ndo.",
    "Guy Carpenter frowned and came into the drawingroom through\nthe window.",
    "He had a long face like a horse he was pale and\nlooked rather supercilious.",
    "His manner was pompous.",
    "Hercule Poirot found him unattractive.",
    "May I ask what all this is about he asked.",
    "Have you been\nannoying my wife\n\nHercule Poirot spread out his hands.",
    "The last thing I should wish is to annoy so charming a lady.",
    "I\nhoped only that the deceased woman having worked for her she\nmight be able to aid me in the investigations I am making.",
    "But  what are these investigations\n\nYes ask him that urged has wife.",
    "A fresh inquiry is being made into the circumstances of Mrs\nMcGintys death.",
    "Nonsense  the case is over.",
    "No no there you are in error.",
    "It is not over.",
    "A fresh inquiry you say Guy Carpenter frowned.",
    "He said\nsuspiciously By the police Nonsense  youre nothing to do with\nthe police.",
    "That is correct.",
    "I am working independently of the police.",
    "Its the Press Eve Carpenter broke in.",
    "Some horrid Sunday\nnewspaper.",
    "He said so.",
    "A gleam of caution came into Guy Carpenters eye.",
    "In his position\nhe was not anxious to antagonise the Press.",
    "He said more\namicably\n\nMy wife is very sensitive.",
    "Murders and things like that upset her.",
    "Im sure it cant be necessary for you to bother her.",
    "She hardly\nknew this woman.",
    "Eve said vehemently\n\nShe was only a stupid old charwoman.",
    "I told him so.",
    "She added\n\nAnd she was a frightful liar too.",
    "Ah that is interesting.",
    "Poirot turned a beaming face from one to\nthe other of them.",
    "So she told lies.",
    "That may give us a very\nvaluable lead.",
    "I dont see how said Eve sulkily.",
    "The establishment of motive said Poirot.",
    "That is the line I am\nfollowing up.",
    "She was robbed of her savings said Carpenter sharply.",
    "That\nwas the motive of the crime.",
    "Ah said Poirot softly.",
    "But was it\n\nHe rose like an actor who had just spoken a telling line.",
    "I regret if I have caused madame any pain he said politely.",
    "These affairs are always rather unpleasant.",
    "The whole business was distressing said Carpenter quickly.",
    "Naturally my wife didnt like being reminded of it.",
    "Im sorry we\ncant help you with any information.",
    "Oh but you have.",
    "I beg your pardon\n\nPoirot said softly\n\nMrs McGinty told lies.",
    "A valuable fact.",
    "What lies exactly did she\ntell madame\n\nHe waited politely for Eve Carpenter to speak.",
    "She said at last\n\nOh nothing particular.",
    "I mean  I cant remember.",
    "Conscious\n\nperhaps\n\nexpectantly she said\n\nthat\n\nboth\n\nmen\n\nwere\n\nlooking\n\nat\n\nher\n\n\fStupid things  about people.",
    "Things that couldnt be true.",
    "Still there was a silence then Poirot said\n\nI see  she had a dangerous tongue.",
    "Eve Carpenter made a quick movement.",
    "Oh no  I didnt mean as much as that.",
    "She was just a gossip that\nwas all.",
    "Just a gossip said Poirot softly.",
    "He made a gesture of farewell.",
    "Guy Carpenter accompanied him out into the hall.",
    "This paper of yours  this Sunday paper  which is it\n\nThe paper I mentioned to madame replied Poirot carefully was\nthe Sunday Companion.",
    "He paused.",
    "Guy Carpenter repeated thoughtfully\n\nThe Sunday Companion.",
    "I dont very often see that Im afraid.",
    "It\n\nhas\n\ninteresting\n\nillustrations...\n\narticles\n\nsometimes.",
    "And\n\ninteresting\n\n\fBefore the pause could be too long he bowed and said quickly\n\nAu revoir Mr Carpenter.",
    "I am sorry if I have  disturbed you.",
    "Outside the gate he looked back at the house.",
    "I wonder he said.",
    "Yes I wonder...\n\nChapter 11\n\nSuperintendent Spence sat opposite Hercule Poirot and sighed.",
    "Im not saying you havent got anything M. Poirot he said slowly.",
    "Personally I think you have.",
    "But its thin.",
    "Its terribly thin\n\nPoirot nodded.",
    "By itself it will not do.",
    "There must be more.",
    "My sergeant or I ought to have spotted that newspaper.",
    "No no you cannot blame yourself.",
    "The crime was so obvious.",
    "Robbery with violence.",
    "The room all pulled about the money\nmissing.",
    "Why should there be significance to you in a torn\nnewspaper amongst the other confusion.",
    "Spence repeated obstinately\n\n\fI should have got that.",
    "And the bottle of ink \n\nI heard of that by the merest chance.",
    "Yet it meant something to you  why\n\nOnly because of that chance phrase about writing a letter.",
    "You\nand I Spence we write so many letters  to us it is such a matter of\ncourse.",
    "Superintendent Spence sighed.",
    "Then he laid out on the table four\nphotographs.",
    "These are the photos you asked me to get  the original photos\nthat the Sunday Companion used.",
    "At any rate theyre a little\nclearer than the reproductions.",
    "But upon my word theyre not\nmuch to go upon.",
    "Old faded  and with women the hairdo makes a\ndifference.",
    "Theres nothing definite in any of them to go upon like\nears or a profile.",
    "That cloche hat and that arty hair and the roses\nDoesnt give you a chance.",
    "You agree with me that we can discard Vera Blake\n\nI should think so.",
    "If Vera Blake was in Broadhinny everyone\nwould know it  telling the sad story of her life seems to have been\nher specialty.",
    "What can you tell me about the others\n\n\fIve got what I could for you in the time.",
    "Eva Kane left the country\nafter Craig was sentenced.",
    "And I can tell you the name she took.",
    "It\nwas Hope.",
    "Symbolic perhaps\n\nPoirot murmured\n\nYes yes  the romantic approach.",
    "Beautiful Evelyn Hope is dead.",
    "A line from one of your poets.",
    "I dare say she thought of that.",
    "Was\nher name Evelyn by the way\n\nYes I believe it was.",
    "But Eva was what she was known as always.",
    "And by the way M. Poirot now that were on the subject the police\nopinion of Eva Kane doesnt quite square with this article here.",
    "Very far from it.",
    "Poirot smiled.",
    "What the police think  it is not evidence.",
    "But it is usually a very\nsound guide.",
    "What did the police think of Eva Kane\n\nThat she was by no means the innocent victim that the public\nthought her.",
    "I was quite a young chap at the time and remember\nhearing it discussed by my old Chief and Inspector Traill who was\nin charge of the case.",
    "Traill believed no evidence mind you that\nthe pretty little idea of putting Mrs Craig out of the way was all Eva\nKanes idea  and that she not only thought of it but she did it.",
    "Craig came home one day and found his little friend had taken a\nshort cut.",
    "She thought it would all pass off as natural death I dare\nsay.",
    "But Craig knew better.",
    "He got the wind up and disposed of the\nbody in the cellar and elaborated the plan of having Mrs Craig die\n\n\fabroad.",
    "Then when the whole thing came out he was frantic in his\nasseverations that hed done it alone that Eva Kane had known\nnothing about it.",
    "Well Superintendent Spence shrugged his\nshoulders nobody could prove anything else.",
    "The stuff was in the\nhouse.",
    "Either of them could have used it.",
    "Pretty Eva Kane was all\ninnocence and horror.",
    "Very well she did it too a clever little\nactress.",
    "Inspector Traill had his doubts  but there was nothing to\ngo upon.",
    "Im giving you that for what its worth M. Poirot.",
    "Its not\nevidence.",
    "But it suggests the possibility that one at least of these tragic\nwomen was something more than a tragic woman  that she was a\nmurderess and that if the incentive was strong enough she might\nmurder again... And now the next one Janice Courtland what can\nyou tell me about her\n\nIve looked up the files.",
    "A nasty bit of goods.",
    "If we hanged Edith\nThompson we certainly ought to have hanged Janice Courtland.",
    "An unpleasant pair she and her husband nothing to choose\nbetween them and she worked on that young man until she had\nhim all up in arms.",
    "But all the time mark you there was a rich man\nin the background and it was to marry him she wanted her\nhusband out of the way.",
    "Did she marry him\n\nSpence shook his head.",
    "No idea.",
    "She went abroad  and then\n\nSpence shook his head.",
    "She was a free woman.",
    "Shed not been charged with anything.",
    "Whether she married or what happened to her we dont know.",
    "One might meet her at a cocktail party any day said Poirot\nthinking of Dr Rendells remark.",
    "Exactly.",
    "Poirot shifted his gaze to the last photograph.",
    "And the child Lily Gamboll\n\nToo young to be charged with murder.",
    "She was sent to an\napproved school.",
    "Good record there.",
    "Was taught shorthand and\ntyping and was found a job under probation.",
    "Did well.",
    "Last heard of\nin Ireland.",
    "I think we could wash her out you know M. Poirot\nsame as Vera Blake.",
    "After all shed made good and people dont\nhold it against a kid of twelve for doing something in a fit of temper.",
    "What about washing her out\n\nI might said Poirot if it were not for the chopper.",
    "It is\nundeniable that Lily Gamboll used a chopper on her aunt and the\nunknown killer of Mrs McGinty used something that was said to be\nlike a chopper.",
    "Perhaps youre right.",
    "Now M. Poirot lets have your side of\nthings.",
    "Nobodys tried to do you in Im glad to see.",
    "Nno said Poirot with a momentary hesitation.",
    "I dont mind telling you Ive had the wind up about you once or\ntwice since that evening in London.",
    "Now what are the possibilities\namongst the residents of Broadhinny\n\nPoirot opened his little notebook.",
    "Eva Kane if she is still alive would be now approaching sixty.",
    "Her\ndaughter of whose adult life our Sunday Companion paints such a\ntouching picture would be now in the thirties.",
    "Lily Gamboll would\nalso be about that age.",
    "Janice Courtland would now be not far\nshort of fifty.",
    "Spence nodded agreement.",
    "So we come to the residents of Broadhinny with especial\nreference to those for whom Mrs McGinty worked.",
    "That last is a fair assumption I think.",
    "Yes it is complicated by the fact that Mrs McGinty did occasional\nodd work here and there but we will assume for the time being\nthat she saw whatever she did see presumably a photograph at\none of her regular houses.",
    "Agreed.",
    "Them as far as age goes that gives us as possibles  first the\nWetherbys where Mrs McGinty worked on the day of her death.",
    "Mrs Wetherby is the right age for Eva Kane and she has a daughter\nof the right age to be Eva Kanes daughter  a daughter said to be\nby previous marriage.",
    "And as regards the photograph\n\nMon cher no positive identification from that is possible.",
    "Too\nmuch time has passed too much water as you say has flowed\nfrom the waterworks.",
    "One can but say this Mrs Wetherby has\nbeen decidedly a pretty woman.",
    "She has all the mannerisms of\none.",
    "She seems much too fragile and helpless to do murder but\nthen that was I understand the popular belief about Eva Kane.",
    "How much actual physical strength would have been needed to kill\nMrs McGinty is difficult to say without knowing exactly what\nweapon was used its handle the ease with which it could be\nswung the sharpness of its cutting edge etcetera.",
    "Yes yes.",
    "Why we never managed to find that  but go on.",
    "The only other remarks I have to make about the Wetherby\nhousehold are that Mr Wetherby could make himself and I fancy\ndoes make himself very unpleasant if he likes.",
    "The daughter is\nfanatically devoted to her mother.",
    "She hates her stepfather.",
    "I do\nnot remark on these facts.",
    "I present them only for consideration.",
    "Daughter\n\nmight\n\nkill\n\nto\n\nprevent\n\nmothers\n\npast\n\ncoming\n\nto\n\nstepfathers ears.",
    "Mother might kill for same reason.",
    "Father might\nkill to prevent scandal coming out.",
    "More murders have been\n\n\fcommitted for respectability than one would believe possible The\nWetherbys are nice people.",
    "Spence nodded.",
    "If  I say if  there is anything in this Sunday Companion business\nthen the Wetherbys are clearly the best bet he said.",
    "Exactly.",
    "The only other person in Broadhinny who would fit in age\nwith Eva Kane m Mrs Upward.",
    "There are two arguments against\nMrs Upward as Eva Kane having killed Mrs McGinty.",
    "First she\nsuffers from arhritis and spends most of her time in a wheeled\nchair \n\nIn a book said Spence enviously that wheeled chair business\nwould be phony but in real life its probably all according to\nCocker.",
    "Secondly continued Poirot Mrs Upward seems of a dogmatic\nand forceful disposition more inclined to bully than to coax which\ndoes not agree with the accounts of our young Eva.",
    "On the other\nhand peoples characters do develop and selfassertiveness is a\nquality that often comes with age.",
    "Thats true enough conceded Spence.",
    "Mrs Upward  not\nimpossible but unlikely.",
    "Now the other possibilities.",
    "Janice\nCourtland\n\nCan I think be ruled out.",
    "There is no one in Broadhinny the right\nage.",
    "Unless one of the younger women is Janice Courtland with her\nface lifted.",
    "Dont mind me  just my little joke.",
    "There are three women of thirtyodd.",
    "There is Deirdre Henderson.",
    "There is Dr Rendells wife and there is Mrs Guy Carpenter.",
    "That is\nto say any one of these could be Lily Gamboll or alternatively Eva\nKanes daughter as far as age goes.",
    "And as far as possibility goes\n\nPoirot sighed.",
    "Eva Kanes daughter may be tall or short dark or fair  we have no\nguide to what she looks like.",
    "We have considered Deirdre\nHenderson in that role.",
    "Now for the other two.",
    "First of all I will tell\nyou this Mrs Rendell is afraid of something.",
    "Afraid of you\n\nI think so.",
    "That\n\nmight\n\nbe\n\nsignificant\n\nsaid\n\nSpence\n\nslowly.",
    "Youre\n\nsuggesting that Mrs Rendell might be Eva Kanes daughter or Lily\nGamboll.",
    "Is she fair or dark\n\nFair.",
    "Lily Gamboll was a fairhaired child.",
    "Mrs Carpenter is also fairhaired.",
    "A most expensively madeup\nyoung woman.",
    "Whether she is actually goodlooking or not she\nhas very remarkable eyes.",
    "Lovely wideopen darkblue eyes.",
    "Now Poirot  Spence shook his head at his friend.",
    "Do you know\nwhat she looked like as she ran out of the room to call her\nhusband I was reminded of a lovely fluttering moth.",
    "She\nblundered into the furniture and stretched her hands out like a\nblind thing.",
    "Spence looked at him indulgently.",
    "Romantic thats what you are M. Poirot he said.",
    "You and your\nlovely fluttering moths and wideopen blue eyes.",
    "Not at all said Poirot.",
    "My friend Hastings was romantic and\nsentimental me never Me I am severely practical.",
    "What I am\ntelling you is that if a girls claim to beauty depend principally on\nthe loveliness of her eyes then no matter how shortsighted she\nis she will take off her spectacles and learn to feel her way round\neven if outlines are blurred and distances hard to judge.",
    "And gently with his forefinger he tapped the photograph of the\nchild Lily Gamboll in her thick disfiguring spectacles.",
    "So thats what you think Lily Gamboll\n\nNo I speak only of what might be.",
    "At the time Mrs McGinty died\nMrs Carpenter was not yet Mrs Carpenter.",
    "She was a young war\nwidow very badly off living in a labourers cottage.",
    "She was\n\n\fengaged to be married to the rich man of the neighbourhood  a\nman with political ambitions and a great sense of his own\nimportance.",
    "If Guy Carpenter had found out that he was about to\nmarry say a child of low origin who had attained notoriety by\nhitting her aunt on the head with a chopper or alternatively the\ndaughter of Craig one of the most notorious criminals of the\ncentury  prominently placed in your Chamber of Horrors  well\none asks would he have gone through with it You say perhaps if\nhe loved the girl yes But he is not quite that kind of man.",
    "I would\nput him down as selfish ambitious and a man very nice in the\nmanner of his reputation.",
    "I think that if young Mrs Selkirk as she\nwas then was anxious achieve the match she would have been\nvery very anxious that no hint of an unfortunate nature got her\nfiances ears.",
    "I see you think its her do you\n\nI tell you again mon cher I do not know.",
    "I examine only\npossibilities.",
    "Mrs Carpenter was on her guard against me careful\nalarmed.",
    "That looks bad.",
    "Yes yes but it is all very difficult.",
    "Once I stayed with some friends\nin the country and they went out to do the shooting.",
    "You know the\nway it goes One walks with the dogs and the guns and the dogs\nthey put up the game  it flies out of the woods up into the air and\nyou go bang bang.",
    "That is like us.",
    "It is not only one bird we put up\nperhaps there are other birds in the cover.",
    "Birds perhaps with\nwhich we have nothing to do.",
    "But the birds themselves do not\n\n\fknow that.",
    "We must make very sure cher ami which is our bird.",
    "During Mrs Carpenters widowhood there may have been\nindiscretions  no worse than that but still inconvenient.",
    "Certainly\nthere must be some reason why she says to me quickly that Mrs\nMcGinty was a liar\n\nSuperintendent Spence rubbed his nose.",
    "Lets get this clear Poirot.",
    "What do you really think\n\nWhat I think does not matter.",
    "I must know.",
    "And as yet the dogs\nhave only just gone into the covert.",
    "Spence murmured\n\nIf we could get anything at all definite.",
    "One really suspicious\ncircumstance.",
    "As it is its all theory and rather farfetched theory\nat that.",
    "The whole things thin you know as I said.",
    "Does anyone\nreally murder for the reasons weve been considering\n\nThat depends said Poirot.",
    "It depends on a lot of family\ncircumstances we do not know.",
    "But the passion for respectability\nis very strong.",
    "These are not artists or Bohemians.",
    "Very nice\npeople live in Broadhinny.",
    "My postmistress said so.",
    "And nice\npeople like to preserve their niceness.",
    "Years of happy married life\nmaybe no suspicion that you were once a notorious figure in one\nof the most sensational murder trials no suspicion that your child\nis the child of a famous murderer.",
    "One might say I would rather\ndie than have my husband know Or I would rather die than my\n\n\fdaughter discover who she is And then you would go on to reflect\nthat it would be better perhaps if Mrs McGinty died...\n\nSpence said quietly\n\nSo you think its the Wetherbys.",
    "No.",
    "They fit the best perhaps but that is all.",
    "In actual character\nMrs Upward is a more likely killer than Mrs Wetherby.",
    "She has\ndetermination and willpower and she fairly dotes on her son.",
    "To\nprevent his learning of what happened before she married his\nfather and settled down to respectable married bliss I think she\nmight go far.",
    "Would it upset him so much\n\nPersonally I do not think so.",
    "Young Robin has a modern sceptical\npoint of view is thoroughly selfish and in any case is less devoted\nI should say to his mother than she to him.",
    "He is not another\nJames Bentley.",
    "Granting Mrs Upward was Eva Kane her son Robin wouldnt kill\nMrs McGinty to prevent that fact coming out\n\nNot for a moment I should say.",
    "He would probably capitalise it.",
    "Use the fact for publicity for his plays I cant see Robin Upward\ncomitting a murder for respectability or devotion or in fact for\nanything but a good solid gain to Robin Upward.",
    "Spence sighed.",
    "He said Its a wide field.",
    "We may be able to get\nsomething on the past history of these people.",
    "But it will take time.",
    "The war has complicated things.",
    "Records destroyed  endless\nopportunities for people who want to cover their traces doing so\nby means of other peoples identity cards etc.",
    "especially after\nincidents when nobody could know which corpse was which If\nwe could concentrate on just one lot but youve got so many\npossibles M. Poirot\n\nWe may be able to cut them down soon.",
    "Poirot left the Superintendents office with less cheerfulness in his\nheart than he had shown in his manner.",
    "He was obsessed as\nSpence was by the urge of time.",
    "If only he could have time...\n\nAnd further back still was one teasing doubt  was the edifice he\nand Spence had built up really sound Supposing after all that\nJames Bentley was guilty...",
    "He did not give in to that doubt but it worried him.",
    "Again and again he had gone over in his mind the interview he had\nhad with James Bentley.",
    "He thought of it now whilst he waited on\nthe platform of Kilchester for his train to come in.",
    "It had been\nmarket day and the platform was crowded.",
    "More crowds were\ncoming in through the barriers.",
    "Poirot leaned forward to look.",
    "Yes the train was coming at last.",
    "Before he could right himself he felt a sudden hard purposeful\nshove in the small of his back.",
    "It was so violent and so unexpected\n\n\fthat he was taken completely unawares.",
    "In another second he\nwould have fallen on the line under the incoming train but a man\nbeside him on the platform caught hold of him in the nick of time\npulling him back.",
    "Why whatever came over you he demanded.",
    "He was a big burly\nArmy Sergeant.",
    "Taken queer Man you were nearly under the\ntrain.",
    "I thank you.",
    "I thank you a thousand times.",
    "Already the crowd was\nmilling round them boarding the train others leaving it.",
    "All right now Ill help you in.",
    "Shaken Poirot subsided onto a seat.",
    "Useless to say I was pushed but he had been pushed.",
    "Up till that\nvery evening he had gone about consciously on his guard on the\nalert for danger.",
    "But after talking with Spence after Spences\nbantering enquiry as to whether any attempt on his life had been\nmade he had insensibly regarded the danger as over or unlikely to\nmaterialise.",
    "But how wrong he had been Amongst those he had interviewed in\nBroadhinny one interview had achieved a result.",
    "Somebody had\nbeen afraid.",
    "Somebody had sought to put an end to his dangerous\nresuscitation of a closed case.",
    "From a call box in the station at Broadhinny Poirot rang up\nSuperintendent Spence.",
    "It is you mon ami Attend I pray.",
    "I have news for you.",
    "Splendid\nnews.",
    "Somebody has tried to kill me...",
    "He listened with satisfaction to the flow of remarks from the other\nend.",
    "No I am not hurt.",
    "But it was a very near thing...",
    "Yes under a train.",
    "No I did not see who did it.",
    "But be assured my friend I shall find\nout.",
    "We know now  that we are on the right track.",
    "Chapter 12\n\nThe man who was testing the electric meter passed the time of day\nwith Guy Carpenters superior manservant who was watching him.",
    "Electricitys going to operate on a new basis he explained.",
    "Graded flat rate according to occupancy.",
    "The superior butler remarked sceptically\n\nWhat you mean is its going to cost more like everything else\n\nThat depends.",
    "Fair shares for all thats what I say.",
    "Did you go in\nto the meeting at Kilchester last night\n\nNo.",
    "Your boss Mr Carpenter spoke very well they say.",
    "Think hell get\nin\n\nIt was a near shave last time I believe.",
    "Yes.",
    "A hundred and twentyfive majority something like that.",
    "Do\nyou drive him in to these meetings or does he drive himself\n\nUsually drives himself.",
    "Likes driving.",
    "Hes got a Rolls Bentley.",
    "Does himself well.",
    "Mrs Carpenter drive too\n\nYes.",
    "Drives a lot too fast in my opinion.",
    "Women usually do.",
    "Was she at the meeting last night too Or isnt\nshe interested in politics\n\nThe superior butler grinned.",
    "Pretends she is anyway.",
    "However she didnt stick it out last\nnight.",
    "Had a headache or something and left in the middle of the\nspeeches.",
    "Ah the electrician peered into the fuse boxes.",
    "Nearly done\nnow he remarked.",
    "He put a few more desultory questions as he\ncollected his tools and prepared to depart.",
    "He walked briskly down the drive but round the corner from the\ngateway he stopped and made an entry in his pocket book.",
    "C. drove home alone last night.",
    "Reached home 10.30 approx..\nCould have been at Kilchester Central Station at time indicated.",
    "Mrs C. left meeting early.",
    "Got home only ten minute before C. Said\nto have come home by train.",
    "It was the second entry in the electricians book.",
    "The first ran\n\nDr R. called out on case last night.",
    "Direction of Kilchester.",
    "Could\nhave been at Kilchester Central Station at time indicated.",
    "Mrs R.\nalone all evening in house After taking coffee in Mrs Scott\nhousekeeper did not see her again that night.",
    "Has small car of her\nown.",
    "II\n\nAt Laburnums collaboration was in process\n\nRobin Upward was saying earnestly\n\nYou do see dont you what a wonderful line that is And if we\nreally get a feeling of sex antagonism between the chap and the\ngirl itll pep the whole thing up enormously\n\nSadly Mrs Oliver ran her hands through her windswept grey hair\ncausing it to look as though swept not by wind but by a tornado.",
    "You do see what I mean dont you Ariadne darling\n\nOh I see what you mean said Mrs Oliver gloomily.",
    "But the main thing is for you to feel really happy about it.",
    "Nobody but a really determined selfdeceiver could have thought\nthat Mrs Oliver looked happy.",
    "Robin continued blithely\n\nWhat I feel is heres that wonderful young man parachuted down\n\n\nMrs Oliver interrupted\n\nHes sixty.",
    "Oh no\n\nHe is.",
    "I dont see him like that.",
    "Thirtyfive  not a day older.",
    "But Ive been writing books about him for thirty years and he was\nat least thirtyfive in the first one.",
    "But darling if hes sixty you cant have the tension between him\nand the girl  whats her name Ingrid.",
    "I mean it would make him\njust a nasty old man\n\nIt certainly would.",
    "So you see he must be thirtyfive said Robin triumphantly.",
    "Then he cant be Sven Hjerson.",
    "Just make him a Norwegian young\nman whos in the Resistance Movement.",
    "But darling Ariadne the whole point of the play is Sven Hjerson.",
    "Youve got an enormous public who simply adore Sven Hjerson\nand wholl flock to see Sven Hjerson.",
    "Hes box office darling\n\nBut people who read my books know what hes like You cant\ninvent an entirely new young man in the Norwegian Resistance\nMovement and just call him Sven Hjerson.",
    "Ariadne darling I did explain all that.",
    "Its not a book darling its a\nplay.",
    "And weve just got to have glamour And if we get this\ntension this antagonism between Sven Hjerson and this  whatshername  Karen  you know all against each other and yet really\nfrightfully attracted\n\nSven Hjerson never cared for women said Mrs Oliver coldly.",
    "But you cant have him a pansy darling Not for this sort of play.",
    "I\nmean its not green bay trees or anything like that.",
    "Its thrills and\nmurders and clean openair fun.",
    "The mention of open air had its effect.",
    "I think Im going out said Mrs Oliver abruptly.",
    "I need air.",
    "I need\nair badly.",
    "Shall I come with you asked Robin tenderly.",
    "No Id rather go alone.",
    "Just as you like darling.",
    "Perhaps youre right.",
    "Id better go and\nwhip up an egg nog for Madre.",
    "The poor sweet is feeling just a\nteeny weeny bit left out of things.",
    "She does like attention you\nknow.",
    "And youll think about that scene in the cellar wont you\nThe whole thing is coming really wonderfully well.",
    "Its going to be\nthe most tremendous success.",
    "I know it is\n\nMrs Oliver sighed.",
    "But the main thing continued Robin is for you to feel happy\nabout it\n\nCasting a cold look at him Mrs Oliver threw a showy military cape\nwhich she had once bought in Italy about her ample shoulders and\nwent out into Broadhinny.",
    "She would forget her troubles she decided by turning her mind to\nthe elucidation of real crime.",
    "Hercule Poirot needed help.",
    "She\nwould take a look at the inhabitants of Broadhinny exercise her\nwomans intuition which had never failed and tell Poirot who the\n\n\fmurderer was.",
    "Then he would only have to get the necessary\nevidence.",
    "Mrs Oliver started her quest by going down the hill to the post\noffice and buying two pounds of apples.",
    "During the purchase she\nentered into amicable conversation with Mrs Sweetiman.",
    "Having agreed that the weather was very warm for the time of\nyear Mrs Oliver remarked that she was staying with Mrs Upward\nat Laburnums.",
    "Yes I know.",
    "Youll be the lady from London that writes the murder\nbooks Three of them Ive got here now in Penguins.",
    "Mrs Oliver cast a glance over the Penguin display.",
    "It was slightly\noverlaid by childrens waders.",
    "The Affair of the Second Goldfish she mused thats quite a\ngood one.",
    "The Cat it was Who Died  thats where I made a\nblowpipe a foot long and its really six feet.",

    "It is\nimportant the stomach.",
    "Maureen looked slightly affronted.",
    "Johnnies got a wonderful stomach she said indignantly.",
    "Absolutely flat.",
    "Practically not a stomach at all.",
    "I was referring to what is put inside it.",
    "You mean my cooking said Maureen.",
    "I never think it matters\nmuch what one eats.",

    "I ought to know she said.",
    "I was an adopted child.",
    "My mother\nparted with me and I had every advantage as they call it.",
    "And its\nalways hurt  always  always  to know that you werent really\nwanted that your mother could let you go.",
    "It was a sacrifice for your good perhaps said Poirot.",
    "Her clear eyes met his.",
    "I dont think thats ever true.",
    "Its the way they put it to themselves.",
    "But what it boils down to is that they can really get on without\nyou.",
    "And it hurts.",
    "I wouldnt give up my children  not for all the\nadvantages in the world\n\nI think youre quite right said Mrs Oliver.",
    "And I too agree said Poirot.",
    "Then thats all right said Maureen cheerfully.",
    "What are we\narguing about\n\nRobin who had come along the terrace to join them said\n\nYes what are you arguing about\n\nAdoption said Maureen.",
    "I dont like being adopted do you\n\nWell its much better than being an orphan dont you think so\ndarling I think we ought to go now dont you Ariadne\n\nThe guests left in a body.",

    "When they reached the gate of Laburnums Robin insisted that\nthey should all come in.",
    "Just to tell Madre all about the party.",
    "So boring for her poor\nsweet not to have been able to go because her leg was playing\nher up.",
    "But she so hates being left out of things.",

    "Who else was there she asked.",
    "The Wetherbys\n\n\f No Mrs Wetherby didnt feel well enough and that Henderson\ngirl wouldnt come without her.",
    "Shes really rather pathetic isnt she said Shelagh Rendell.",
    "I think almost pathological dont you said Robin.",
    "Its that mother of hers said Maureen.",
    "Some mothers really do\nalmost eat their young dont they\n\nShe flushed suddenly as she met Mrs Upwards quizzical eye.",
    "Do I devour you Robin Mrs Upward asked.",
    "Madre Of course not\n\nTo cover her confusion Maureen hastily plunged into an account of\nher breeding experiences with Irish wolfhounds.",
    "The conversation\nbecame technical.",
    "Mrs Upward said decisively\n\nYou cant get away from heredity  in people as well as dogs.",
    "Shelagh Rendell murmured\n\nDont you think its environment\n\nMrs Upward cut her short.",
    "No my dear I dont.",
    "Environment can give a veneer  no more.",
    "Its\nwhats bred in people that counts.",
    "Hercule Poirots eyes rested curiously on Shelagh Rendells\nflushed face.",
    "She said with what seemed unnecessary passion\n\nBut thats cruel  unfair.",
    "Mrs Upward said Life is unfair.",
    "The slow lazy voice of Johnnie Summerhayes joined in.",
    "I agree with Mrs Upward.",
    "Breeding tells.",
    "Thats been my creed\nalways.",
    "Mrs Oliver said questioningly You mean things are handed down.",
    "Unto the third or fourth generation \n\nMaureen Summerhayes said suddenly in her sweet high voice\n\nBut that quotation goes on And show mercy unto thousands.",
    "Once again everybody seemed a little embarrassed perhaps at\nthe serious note that had crept into the conversation.",
    "They made a diversion by attacking Poirot.",
    "Tell us all about Mrs. McGinty M. Poirot Why didnt the dreary\nlodger kill her\n\n\fHe used to mutter you know said Robin.",
    "Walking about in the\nlanes.",
    "Ive often met him.",
    "And really definitely he looked frightfully\nqueer.",
    "You must have some reason for thinking he didnt kill her M.\nPoirot.",
    "Do tell us.",
    "Poirot smiled at them.",
    "He twirled his moustache.",
    "If he didnt kill her who did\n\nYes who did\n\nMrs Upward said dryly Dont embarrass the man.",
    "He probably\nsuspects one of us.",
    "One of us Oo\n\nIn the clamour Poirots eyes met those of Mrs Upward.",
    "They were\namused and  something else  challenging\n\nHe suspects one of us said Robin delightedly.",
    "Now then\nMaureen he assumed the manner of a bullying K.C.",
    "Where were\nyou on the night of the  what night was it\n\nNovember 22nd said Poirot.",
    "On the night of the 22nd\n\nGracious I dont know said Maureen.",
    "Nobody could know after all this time said Mr Rendell.",
    "Well I can said Robin.",
    "Because I was broadcasting that night.",
    "I\ndrove to Coalport to give a talk on Some Aspects of the Theatre.",
    "I\nremember because I discussed Galsworthys charwoman in the\nSilver Box at great length and the next day Mrs McGinty was killed\nand I wondered if the charwoman in the play had been like her.",
    "Thats right said Shelagh Rendell suddenly.",
    "And I remember\nnow because you said your mother would be all alone because it\nwas Janets night off and I came down here after dinner to keep\nher company.",
    "Only unfortunately I couldnt make her hear.",
    "Let me think said Mrs Upward.",
    "Oh yes of course.",
    "Id gone to\nbed with a headache and my bedroom faces the back garden.",
    "And next day said Shelagh when I heard Mrs McGinty had\nbeen killed I thought Oo I might have passed the murderer in the\ndark  because at first we all thought it must have been some\ntramp who broke in.",
    "Well I still dont remember what I was doing said Maureen.",
    "But\nI do remember the next morning.",
    "It was the baker told us.",
    "Old Mrs\nMcGintys been done in he said.",
    "And there I was wondering why\nshe hadnt turned up as usual.",
    "She gave a shiver.",
    "Its horrible really isnt it she said.",
    "Mrs Upward was still watching Poirot.",
    "He thought to himself She s a very intelligent woman  and a\nruthless one.",
    "Also selfish.",
    "In whatever she did she would have no\nqualms and no remorse...\n\nA thin voice was speaking  urging querulous.",
    "Havent you got any clues M. Poirot\n\nIt was Shelagh Rendell.",
    "Johnnie Summerhayes long dark face lit up enthusiastically.",
    "Thats it clues he said.",
    "Thats what I like in detective stories.",
    "Clues that mean everything to the detective  and nothing to you until the end when you fairly kick yourself.",
    "Cant you give us one\nlittle clue M. Poirot\n\nLaughing pleading faces turned to him.",
    "A game to them all or\nperhaps not to one of them.",
    "But murder wasnt a game  murder\nwas dangerous.",
    "You never knew.",
    "With a sudden brusque movement Poirot pulled out four\nphotographs from his pocket.",
    "You want a clue he said.",
    "Voil\u00e0\n\nAnd with a dramatic gesture he tossed them down on the table.",

    "But why are they clues\n\nWho are they\n\nPoirot looked slowly round at the circle of faces.",
    "He saw nothing other than he might have expected to see.",
    "You do not recognise any of them\n\nRecognize\n\n\fYou do not shall I say remember having any of those\nphotographs before But yes  Mrs Upward You recognise\nsomething do you not\n\nMrs Upward hesitated.",
    "Yes  I think \n\nWhich one\n\nHer forefinger went out and rested on the spectacled childlike face\nof Lily Gamboll.",
    "You have seen that photograph  when \n\nQuite recently... Now where  no I cant remember.",
    "But Im sure\nIve seen a photograph just like that.",
    "She sat frowning her brows drawn together.",
    "She came out of her abstraction as Mrs Rendell came to her.",
    "Goodbye Mrs Upward.",
    "I do hope youll come to tea with me one\nday if you feel up to it.",
    "Thank you my dear.",
    "If Robin pushes me up the hill.",
    "Of course Madre.",
    "Ive developed the most tremendous muscles\npushing that chair.",
    "Do you remember the day we went to the\nWetherbys and it was so muddy \n\nAh said Mrs Upward suddenly.",
    "What is it Madre\n\nNothing.",
    "Go on.",
    "Getting you up the hill again.",
    "First the chair skidded and then I\nskidded.",
    "I thought wed never get home.",
    "Laughing they took their leave and trooped out.",
    "Alcohol Poirot thought certainly loosens the tongue...\n\nHad he been wise or foolish to display those photographs\n\nHad that gesture also been the result of alcohol\n\nHe wasnt sure.",
    "But murmuring an excuse he turned back.",
    "He pushed open the gate and walked up to the house.",
    "Through the\nopen window on his left he heard the murmur of two voices.",
    "They\nwere the voices of Robin and Mrs Oliver.",
    "Very little of Mrs Oliver\nand a good deal of Robin.",

    "Mrs Upward was\nsitting before the fire.",
    "There was a rather look on her face.",
    "She\nhad been so deep in thought that his entry startled her.",
    "At the sound of the apologetic little cough he gave she looked up\nsharply with a start.",
    "Oh she said.",
    "Its you.",
    "You startled me.",
    "I am sorry madame.",
    "Did you think it was someone else Who did\nyou think it was\n\nShe did not answer that merely said\n\nDid you leave something behind\n\nWhat I feared I had left was danger.",
    "Danger\n\nDanger perhaps to you.",

    "How did she die Sticking her neck out just\nlike I.",
    "Is that what you mean\n\nYes.",
    "If you know anything  anything at all tell it to me now.",

    "My dear man its not nearly so simple as that.",
    "Im not at all sure\nthat I do know anything  certainly nothing as definite as a fact.",
    "Vague recollections are very tricky things.",
    "One would have to have\nsome idea of how and where and when if you follow what I mean.",
    "But it seems to me that you already have that idea.",
    "There is more to it than that.",
    "There are various factors to be taken\ninto consideration.",
    "Now its no good your rushing me M. Poirot.",
    "Im\nnot the kind of person who rushes into decisions.",
    "Ive a mind of my\nown and I take time to make it up.",
    "When I come to a decision I act.",

    "Knowledge is power.",
    "Power must only be\nused for the right ends.",
    "You will excuse my saying that you dont\nperhaps appreciate the pattern of our English country life.",
    "In other words you say to me You are only a damned foreigner.",

    "I shouldnt be a rude as that.",
    "If you do not want to talk to me there is Superintendent Spence.",
    "My dear M. Poirot.",
    "Not the police.",
    "No at this stage.",
    "He shrugged his shoulders.",
    "I have warned you.",
    "he said.",
    "For he was sure that by now Mrs Upward remembered quite well\nexactly when and where she had seen the photograph.",
    "Chapter 14\n\nDecidedly said Hercule Poirot to himself the following morning\nthe spring is here.",
    "His apprehensions of\n\nthe night before seemed singularly\n\ngroundless.",
    "Mrs Upward was a sensible woman who could take good care of\nherself.",

    "Since yesterday he had felt extremely nervous.",
    "Pardon madame.",
    "You made me jump.",
    "Mrs Rendell smiled mechanically.",
    "If he were nervous Mrs Rendell\nhe thought was even more so.",
    "There was twitching in one of her\neyelids and her hands worked restlessly together.",
    "I  I hope Im not interrupting you.",
    "Perhaps youre busy.",
    "But no I am not busy.",
    "The day it is fine.",

    "Yes.",
    "Yes I suppose there is.",
    "The windows they will not shut and the doors they fly open all the\ntime.",
    "Its rather a ramshackle house.",
    "And of course the Summerhayes\nare so badly off they cant afford to do much to it.",
    "Id let it go if I\nwere them.",
    "I know its been in the family for hundreds of years but\nnowadays you just cant cling on to things for sentiments sake.",
    "No we are not sentimental nowadays.",
    "There was a silence.",
    "Out of the corner of his eye Poirot watched\nthose nervous white hands.",
    "He waited for her to take the initiative.",
    "When she did speak it was abruptly.",
    "I suppose she said that when you are well investigating a\nthing youd always have to have a pretext\n\nPoirot considered the question.",
    "Though he did not look at her he\nwas perfectly well aware of her eager sideways glance fixed on\nhim.",
    "As you say madame he replied noncommittally it is a\nconvenience.",
    "To explain your being there and  and asking things.",
    "It might be expedient.",
    "Why  why are you really here in Broadhinny M. Poirot\n\nHe turned a mild surprised gaze on her.",
    "But my dear lady I told you  to inquire into the death of Mrs\nMcGinty.",
    "Mrs Rendell said sharply\n\nI know thats what you say.",
    "But its ridiculous.",
    "Poirot raised his eyebrows.",
    "Is it\n\nOf course it is.",
    "Nobody believes it.",
    "And yet I assure you it is simple fact.",
    "Her pale blue eyes blinked and she looked away.",
    "You wont tell me.",
    "Tell you  what madame\n\nShe changed the subject abruptly again it seemed.",
    "I wanted to ask you  about anonymous letters.",
    "Yes said Poirot encouragingly as she stopped.",
    "Theyre really always lies arent they\n\nThey are sometimes lies said Poirot cautiously.",
    "Usually she persisted.",
    "I dont know that I would go as far as saying that.",
    "Shelagh Rendell said vehemently\n\nTheyre cowardly treacherous mean things\n\nAll that yes I would agree.",
    "And you wouldnt ever believe what was said in one would you\n\nThat is a very difficult question said Poirot gravely.",
    "I wouldnt.",
    "I wouldnt believe anything of that kind.",
    "She added vehemently\n\nI know why youre down here.",
    "And it isnt true I tell you it isnt\ntrue.",
    "She turned sharply and walked away.",
    "Hercule Poirot raised his eyebrows in an interested fashion.",
    "And now what he demanded of himself.",
    "Am I being taken up\nthe garden walk Or is this the bird of a different colour\n\nIt was all he felt very confusing.",
    "Mrs Rendell professed to believe that he was down here for a\nreason other than that of inquiring into Mrs McGintys death.",
    "She\nhad suggested that that was only a pretext.",
    "Did she really believe that Or was she as he had just said to\nhimself leading him up the garden walk\n\nWhat had anonymous letters got to do with it\n\nWas Mrs Rendell the original of the photograph that Mrs Upward\nhad said she had seen recently\n\nIn other words was Mrs Rendell Lily Gamboll Lily Gamboll a\nrehabilitated member of society had been last heard of in Eire.",
    "Had Dr Rendell met and married his wife there in ignorance of her\nhistory Lily Gamboll had been trained as a stenographer.",
    "Her\npath and the doctors might easily have crossed.",
    "Poirot shook his head and sighed.",
    "It was all perfectly possible.",
    "But he had to be sure.",
    "A chilly wind sprang up suddenly and the sun went in.",
    "Poirot shivered and retraced his steps to the house.",
    "Yes he had to be sure.",
    "If he could find the actual weapon of the\nmurder \n\n\fAnd at that moment with a strange feeling of certainty  he saw it.",
    "II\n\nAfterwards he wondered whether subconsciously he had seen\nand noted it much earlier.",
    "It had stood there presumably ever\nsince he had come to Long Meadows...",
    "There on the littered top of the bookcase near the window.",
    "He thought Why did I never notice that before\n\nHe picked it up weighed it in his hands examined it balanced it\nraised it to strike \n\nMaureen came in through the door with her usual rush two dogs\naccompanying her.",
    "Her voice light and friendly said\n\nHullo are you playing with the sugar cutter\n\nIs that what it is A sugar cutter\n\nYes.",
    "A sugar cutter  or a sugar hammer  I dont know what\nexactly is the right term.",
    "Its rather fun isnt it So childish with the\nlittle bird on top.",
    "Poirot turned the implement carefully in his hands.",
    "Made of much\nornamented brass it was shaped like an adze heavy with a sharp\n\n\fcutting edge.",
    "It was studded here and there with coloured stones\npale blue and red.",
    "On top of it was a frivolous little bird with\nturquoise eye.",
    "Lovely thing for killing anyone wouldnt it be said Maureen\nconversationally.",
    "She took it from him and aimed a murderous blow on a point in\nspace.",
    "Frightfully easy she said.",
    "Whats that bit in the Idylls of the\nKing Marks way he said and clove him to the brain.",
    "I should\nthink you could cleave anyone to the brain with this all right dont\nyou\n\nPoirot looked at her.",
    "Her freckled face was serene and cheerful.",
    "She said\n\nIve told Johnnie whats coming to him if I get fed up with him.",
    "I\ncall it the wifes best friend\n\nShe laughed put the sugar hammer down and turned towards the\ndoor.",
    "What did I come in here for she mused.",
    "I cant remember...",
    "Bother Id better go and see if that pudding needs more water in\nthe saucepan.",
    "Poirots voice stopped her before she got to the door.",
    "You brought this back with you from India perhaps\n\nOh no said Maureen.",
    "I got it at the B. and B. at Christmas.",
    "B. and B. Poirot was puzzled.",
    "Bring and Buy explained Maureen glibly.",
    "At the Vicarage.",
    "You\nbring things you dont want and you buy something.",
    "Something\nnot too frightful if you can find it.",
    "Of course theres practically\nnever anything you really want.",
    "I got this and that coffee pot.",
    "I like\nthe coffee pots nose and I liked the little bird on the hammer.",
    "The coffee pot was a small one of beaten copper.",

    "I think they come from Baghdad said Maureen.",
    "At least I think\nthats what the Wetherbys said.",
    "Or it may have been Persia.",
    "It was from the Wetherbys house then that these came\n\nYea.",

    "I dont think Im in any danger said Maude confidently.",
    "I do not think so at the moment.",
    "You are unknown in Broadhinny\n\nMaude considered.",
    "Yees.",
    "Yes I should say so.",
    "You have been there\n\nOnce or twice  for the firm of course  only once recently  that\nwas about five months ago.",
    "Who did you see Where did you go\n\nI went to see an old lady  Mrs Carstairs  or Carlile  I cant\nremember her name for sure.",

    "Even if she did it wouldnt matter would it\nAfter all one changes ones job quite often these days.",
    "But I dont\nsuppose she even looked at me.",
    "Her sort dont.",
    "There was a faint bitterness in Maude Williams voice.",
    "Did you see anyone else in Broadhinny\n\nMaude said rather awkwardly\n\nWell I saw Mr Bentley.",
    "Ah you saw Mr Bentley.",
    "By accident.",
    "Maude wriggled a little in her chair.",
    "No as a matter of fact Id sent him a post card.",

    "While I was waiting for my bus back.",
    "That was before the death of Mrs McGinty\n\nOh yes.",
    "But not much before though.",
    "Because it was only a few\ndays later that it was all in the newspapers.",
    "Did Mr Bentley speak to you at all of his landlady\n\nI dont think so.",
    "And you spoke to no one else in Broadhinny\n\nWell  only Mr Robin Upward.",
    "Ive heard him talk on the wireless.",
    "I\nsaw him coming out of his cottage and I recognised him from his\npictures and I did ask him for his autograph.",
    "And he gave it you\n\nOh yes he was ever so nice about it.",
    "I hadnt my book with me\nbut Id got an odd sheet of notepaper and he whipped out his\nfountain pen and wrote it at once.",
    "Do you know any of the other people in Broadhinny by sight\n\nWell I know the Carpenters of course.",
    "Theyre in Kilchester a lot.",
    "Lovely car theyve got and she wears lovely clothes.",
    "She opened a\nBazaar about a month ago.",
    "They say hes going to be our next\nM.P.",
    "Poirot nodded.",
    "Then he took from his pocket the envelope that he\nalways carried about with him.",
    "He spread the four photographs on\nthe table.",
    "Do you recognise any of  whats the matter\n\nIt was Mr Scuttle.",
    "Just going out of the door.",
    "I hope he didnt see\nyou with me.",
    "It might seem a bit odd.",
    "People are talking about you\nyou know.",

    "I am Belgian not French but no matter.",
    "Whats this about these photographs She bent over studying\nthem closely.",
    "Rather on the oldfashioned side arent they\n\nThe oldest is thirty years ago.",
    "Awfully silly old fashioned clothes look.",
    "Makes the women look\nsuch fools.",
    "Have you seen any of them before\n\nDyou mean do I recognise any of the women or do you mean\nhave I seen the pictures\n\nEither.",
    "Ive an idea Ive seen that one.",
    "Her finger rested against Janice\nCourtland in her cloche hat.",
    "In some paper or other but I cant\n\n\fremember when.",
    "That kid looks a bit familiar too.",
    "But I cant\nremember when I saw them some time ago.",
    "All those photographs appeared in the Sunday Companion on the\nSunday before Mrs McGinty died.",
    "Maude looked at him sharply.",
    "And theyve got something to do with it Thats why you want me\nto \n\nShe did not finish the sentence.",
    "Yes said Hercule Poirot.",
    "That is why.",
    "He took something else from his pocket and showed it to her.",
    "It\nwas the cutting from the Sunday Companion.",
    "You had better read that he said.",
    "She read it carefully.",
    "Her bright golden head bent over the flimsy\nbit of newsprint.",
    "Then she looked up.",
    "So thats who they are And reading this has given you ideas\n\nYou could not express it more justly.",
    "But all the same I dont see  She was silent a moment thinking.",
    "Poirot did not speak.",
    "However pleased he might be with his own\nideas he was always ready to hear other peoples ideas too.",
    "You think one or other of these people is in Broadhinny\n\nIt might be might it not\n\nOf course.",
    "Anyone may be anywhere... She went on placing her\nfinger on Eva Kanes pretty simpering face Shed be quite old\nnow  about Mrs Upwards age.",
    "About that.",
    "What I was thinking was  the sort of woman she was  there must\nbe several people whod have it in for her.",
    "That is a point of view said Poirot slowly.",
    "Yes it is a point of\nview.",
    "He added You remember the Craig case\n\nWho doesnt said Maude Williams.",
    "Why hes in Madame\nTussauds I was only a kid at the time but the newspapers are\nalways bringing him up and comparing the case with other cases.",
    "I\ndont suppose it will ever be forgotten do you\n\nPoirot raised his head sharply.",
    "He wondered what brought that sudden note of bitterness into her\nvoice.",
    "Chapter 17\n\nFeeling completely bewildered Mrs Oliver was endeavouring to\ncower in the corner of a very minute theatrical dressingroom.",
    "Not\nbeing the figure to cower she only succeeded in bulging.",
    "Bright\nyoung men removing grease paint with towels surrounded her\nand at intervals pressed warm beer upon her.",
    "Mrs Upward her good humour completely restored had speeded\ntheir departure with good wishes.",
    "Robin had been assiduous in\nmaking all arrangements for her comfort before departure\nrunning back a couple of times after they were in the car to see\nthat all was as it should be.",
    "On the last occasion he came back grinning.",
    "Madre was just ringing off on the telephone and the wicked old\nthing still wont tell me who she was ringing up.",
    "But I bet I know.",
    "I know too said Mrs Oliver.",
    "Well who do you say\n\nHercule Poirot.",
    "Yes thats my guess too.",
    "Shes going to pump him.",
    "Madre does\nlike having her little secrets doesnt she Now darling about the\n\n\fplay tonight.",
    "Its very important that you tell me honestly just what\nyou think of Cecil  and whether hes your idea of Eric...\n\nNeedless to say Cecil Leech had not been at all Mrs Olivers idea\nof Eric.",
    "Nobody indeed could have been more unlike.",
    "The play\nitself she had enjoyed but the ordeal of going round afterwards\nwas fraught with its usual terrors.",
    "Robin of course was in his element.",
    "He had Cecil at least Mrs\nOliver supposed it was Cecil pinned against the wall and was\ntalking nineteen to the dozen.",
    "Mrs Oliver had been terrified of Cecil\nand much preferred somebody called Michael who was talking to\nher kindly at the moment.",
    "Michael at least did not expect her to\nreciprocate in fact Michael seemed to prefer a monologue.",
    "Somebody called Peter made occasional incursions on the\nconversation but on the whole it resolved itself into a thin stream\nof faintly amusing malice by Michael.",
    "too sweet of Robin he was saying.",
    "Weve been urging him to\ncome and see the show.",
    "But of course hes completely under that\nterrible womans thumb isnt he Dancing attendance.",
    "And really\nRobin is brilliant dont you think so Quite quite brilliant.",
    "He\nshouldnt be sacrificed on a Matriarchal altar.",
    "Women can be\nawful cant they You know what she did to poor Alex Roscoff All\nover him for nearly a year and then discovered that he wasnt a\nRussian \u00e9migr\u00e9 at all.",
    "Of course he had been telling her some very\ntall stories but quite amusing and we all knew it wasnt true but\nafter all why should one care  and then when she found out he\nwas just a little East End tailors son she dropped him my dear.",
    "I\nmean I do hate a snob dont you Really Alex was thankful to get\n\n\faway from her.",
    "He said she could be quite frightening sometimes a little queer in the head he thought.",
    "Her rages Robin dear were\ntalking about your wonderful Madre.",
    "Such a shame she couldnt\ncome tonight.",
    "But its marvelous to have Mrs Oliver.",
    "All those\ndelicious murders.",
    "An elderly man with a deep bass voice grasped Mrs Olivers hand\nand held it in a hot sticky grasp.",
    "How can I ever thank you he said in tones of deep melancholy.",
    "Youve saved my life  saved my life many a time.",
    "Then they all came out into the fresh night air and went across to\nthe Ponys Head where there were more drinks and more stage\nconversation.",
    "By the time Mrs Oliver and Robin were driving homewards Mrs\nOliver was quite exhausted.",
    "She leaned back and closed her eyes.",
    "Robin on the other hand talked without stopping.",
    "and you do think that might be an idea dont you he finally\nended.",
    "What\n\nMrs Oliver jerked open her eyes.",
    "She had been lost in a nostalgic dream of home.",
    "Walls covered\nwith exotic birds and foliage.",
    "A deal table her typewriter black\ncoffee apples everywhere... What bliss glorious and solitary bliss\n\n\fWhat a mistake for an author to emerge from her secret fastness.",
    "Authors were shy unsociable creatures atoning for their lack of\nsocial\n\naptitude\n\nby\n\ninventing\n\ntheir\n\nown\n\ncompanions\n\nand\n\nconversations.",
    "Im afraid youre tired said Robin.",
    "Not really.",
    "The truth is Im not very good with people.",
    "I adore people dont you said Robin happily.",
    "No said Mrs Oliver firmly.",
    "But you must.",
    "Look at all the people in your books.",
    "Thats different.",
    "I think trees are much nicer than people more\nrestful.",
    "I need people said Robin stating an obvious fact.",
    "They\nstimulate me.",
    "He drew up at the gate of Laburnums.",
    "You go in he said.",
    "Ill put the car away.",
    "Mrs Oliver extracted herself with the usual difficulty and walked up\nthe path.",
    "The doors not locked Robin called.",
    "It wasnt.",
    "Mrs Oliver pushed it open and entered.",
    "There were no\nlights on and that struck her as rather ungracious on her\nhostesss part.",
    "Or was it perhaps economy Rich people were so\noften economical.",
    "There was a smell of scent in the hall something\nrather exotic and expensive.",
    "For a moment Mrs Oliver wondered if\nshe were in the right house then she found the light switch and\npressed it down.",
    "The light sprang up in the low oakbeamed square hall.",
    "The door\ninto the sittingroom was ajar and she caught sight of a foot and\nleg.",
    "Mrs Upward after all had not gone to bed.",
    "She must have\nfallen asleep in her chair and since no lights were on she must\nhave been asleep a long time.",
    "Mrs Oliver went to the door and switched on the lights in the\nsittingroom.",
    "Were back  she began and then stopped.",
    "Her hand went up to her throat.",
    "She felt a tight knot there a desire\nto scream that she could not put into operation.",
    "Her voice came out in a whisper\n\nRobin  Robin...",
    "It was some time before she heard him coming up the path\nwhistling and then she turned quickly and ran to meet him in the\nhall.",
    "Dont go in there  dont go in.",
    "Your mother  she  shes dead  I\nthink  shes been killed...\n\nChapter 18\n\nQuite a neat bit of work said Superintendent Spence.",
    "His red countrymans face was angry.",
    "He looked across to where\nHercule Poirot sat gravely listening.",
    "Neat and ugly he said.",
    "She was strangled he went on.",
    "Silk\nscarf  one of her own silk scarves one shed been wearing that\nday  just passed around the neck and the ends crossed  and\npulled.",
    "Neat quick efficient.",
    "The thugs did it that way in India.",
    "The\nvictim doesnt struggle or cry out  pressure on the carotid artery.",
    "Special knowledge\n\nCould be  need not.",
    "If you were thinking of doing it you could\nread up the subject.",
    "Theres no practical difficulty.",
    "Especially with\nthe victim quite unsuspicious  and she was unsuspicious\n\nPoirot nodded.",
    "Someone she knew.",
    "Yes.",
    "Theyd had coffee together  a cup opposite her and one\nopposite the guest.",
    "Prints had been wiped off the guests cup very\n\n\fcarefully but lipstick is more difficult  there were still faint traces\nof lipstick.",
    "A woman then\n\nYou expected a woman didnt you\n\nOh yes.",
    "Yes that was indicated.",
    "Spence went on\n\nMrs Upward recognised one of those photographs  the\nphotograph of Lily Gamboll.",
    "So it ties up with the McGinty murder.",
    "Yes said Poirot.",
    "It ties up with the McGinty murder.",
    "He remembered Mrs Upwards slightly amused expression as she\nhad said\n\nMrs McGintys dead.",
    "How did she die\n\nSticking her neck out just like I.\n\nSpence was going on\n\nShe took an opportunity that seemed good to her  her son and\nMrs Oliver were going off to the theatre.",
    "She rang up the person\n\n\fconcerned and asked that person to come and see her.",
    "Is that how\nyou figure it out She was playing detective.",
    "Something like that.",
    "Curiosity.",
    "She kept her knowledge to herself\nbut she wanted to find out more.",
    "She didnt in the least realise\nwhat she was doing might be dangerous.",
    "Poirot sighed.",
    "So many people think of murder as a game.",
    "It is not\na game.",
    "I told her so.",
    "But she would not listen.",
    "No we know that.",
    "Well that fits in fairly well.",
    "When young Robin\nstarted off with Mrs Oliver and ran back into the house his mother\nhad just finished telephoning to someone.",
    "She wouldnt say who\nto.",
    "Played it mysterious.",
    "Robin and Mrs Oliver thought it might be\nyou.",
    "I wish it had been said Hercule Poirot.",
    "You have no idea to\nwhom it was that she telephoned\n\nNone whatever.",
    "Its all automatic round here you know.",
    "The maid couldnt help you in any way\n\nNo.",
    "She came in about halfpast ten  she has a key to the back\ndoor.",
    "She went straight into her own room which leads off the\nkitchen and went to bed.",
    "The house was dark and she assumed\nthat Mrs Upward had gone to bed and that the others had not yet\nreturned.",
    "Spence added\n\n\fShes deaf and pretty crotchety as well.",
    "Takes very little notice of\nwhat goes on  and I imagine does as little work as she can with as\nmuch grumbling as possible.",
    "Not really an old faithful\n\nOh no  shes only been with the Upwards a couple of years.",
    "A constable put his head round the door.",
    "Theres a young lady to see you sir he said.",
    "Says theres\nsomething perhaps you ought to know.",
    "About last night.",
    "About last night Send her in.",
    "Deirdre Henderson came in.",
    "She looked pale and strained and as\nusual rather awkward.",
    "I thought perhaps Id better come she said.",
    "If Im interrupting\nyou or anything she added apologetically.",
    "Not at all Miss Henderson.",
    "Spence rose and pushed forward a chair.",
    "She sat down on it\nsquarely in an ungainly schoolgirlish sort of way.",
    "Something about last night said Spence encouragingly.",
    "About\nMrs Upward you mean\n\n\fYes its true isnt it that she was murdered I mean the post said\nso and the baker.",
    "Mother said of course it couldnt be true  She\nstopped.",
    "Im afraid your mother isnt quite right there.",
    "Its true enough.",
    "Now you wanted to make a  to tell us something\n\nDeirdre nodded.",
    "Yes she said.",
    "You see I was there.",
    "A difference crept into Spences manner.",
    "It was perhaps even\nmore gentle but an official hardness underlay it.",
    "You were there he said.",
    "At Laburnums.",
    "At what time\n\nI dont know exactly said Deirdre.",
    "Between halfpast eight and\nnine I suppose.",
    "Probably nearly nine.",
    "After dinner anyway.",
    "You\nsee she telephoned to me.",
    "Mrs Upward telephoned to you\n\nYes.",
    "She said Robin and Mrs Oliver were going to the theatre in\nCullenquay and that she would be all alone and would I come along\nand have coffee with her.",
    "And you went\n\nYes.",
    "And you  had coffee with her\n\nDeirdre shook her head.",
    "No I got there  and I knocked.",
    "But there wasnt any answer.",
    "So I\nopened the door and went into the hall.",
    "It was quite dark and Id\nseen from outside that there was no light in the sittingroom.",
    "So I\nwas puzzled.",
    "I called Mr Upward once or twice but there was no\nanswer.",
    "So I thought there must be some mistake.",
    "What mistake did you think there could have been\n\nI thought perhaps shed gone to the theatre with them after all.",
    "Without letting you know\n\nThat did seem queer.",
    "You couldnt think of any other explanation\n\nWell I thought perhaps Frieda might have bungled the original\nmessage.",
    "She does get things wrong sometimes.",
    "Shes a\nforeigner.",
    "She was excited herself last night because she was\nleaving.",
    "What did you do Miss Henderson\n\nI just went away.",
    "Back home\n\n\fYes  that is I went for a little walk first.",
    "It was quite fine.",
    "Spence was silent for a moment or two looking at her.",
    "He was\nlooking Poirot noticed at her mouth.",
    "Presently he roused himself and said briskly\n\nWell thank you Miss Henderson.",
    "You were quite right to come\nand tell us this.",
    "Were much obliged to you.",
    "He got up and shook hands with her.",
    "I thought I ought to said Deirdre.",
    "Mother didnt want me to.",
    "Didnt she now\n\nBut I thought Id better.",
    "Quite right.",
    "He showed her out and came back.",
    "He sat down drummed on the table and looked at Poirot.",
    "No lipstick he said.",
    "Or is that only this morning\n\nNo it is not only this morning.",
    "She never uses it.",
    "Thats odd nowadays isnt it\n\n\fShe is rather an odd kind of girl  undeveloped.",
    "And no scent either as far as I could smell.",
    "That Mrs Oliver says\nthere was a distinct smell of scent  expensive scent she says  in\nthe house last night.",
    "Robin Upward confirms that.",
    "It wasnt any\nscent his mother uses.",
    "This girl would not use scent I think said Poirot.",
    "I shouldnt think so either said Spence.",
    "Looks rather like the\nhockey captain from an oldfashioned girls school  but she must\nbe every bit of thirty I should say.",
    "Quite that.",
    "Arrested development would you say\n\nPoirot considered.",
    "Then he said it was not quite so simple as that.",
    "It doesnt fit aid Spence frowning.",
    "No lipstick no scent.",
    "And\nsince shes got a perfectly good mother and Lily Gambolls mother\nwas done in in a drunken brawl in Cardiff when Lily Gamboll was\nnine years old I dont see how she can be Lily Gamboll.",
    "But  Mrs\nUpward telephoned her to come there last night  you cant get\naway from that.",
    "He rubbed his nose.",
    "It isnt straightforward\ngoing.",
    "What about the medical evidence\n\n\fNot much help there.",
    "All the police surgeon will say definitely is\nthat she was probably dead by halfpast nine.",
    "So she may have been dead when Deirdre Henderson came to\nLaburnums\n\nProbably was if the girl is saying the truth.",
    "Either she is speaking\nthe truth  or else shes a deep one.",
    "Mother didnt want her to come\nto us she said.",
    "Anything there\n\nPoirot considered.",
    "Not particularly.",
    "It is what Mother would say.",
    "She is the type you\ncomprehend that avoids unpleasantness.",
    "Spence sighed.",
    "So weve got Deirdre Henderson  on the spot.",
    "Or else someone\nwho came there before Deirdre Henderson.",
    "A woman.",
    "A woman\nwho uses lipstick and expensive scent.",
    "Poirot murmured You will inquire \n\nSpence broke in.",
    "Im inquiring Just tactfully for the moment.",
    "We dont want to\nalarm anyone.",
    "What was Eve Carpenter doing last night What was\nShelagh Rendell doing last night Ten to one they were just sitting\nat home.",
    "Carpenter I know had a political meeting.",
    "Eve said Poirot thoughtfully.",
    "The fashions in names change do\nthey not Hardly ever nowadays do you hear of an Eva.",
    "It has\ngone out.",
    "But Eve it is popular.",
    "She can afford expensive scent said Spence pursuing his own\ntrain of thought.",
    "He sighed.",
    "Weve got to get at more of her background.",
    "Its so convenient to\nbe a war widow.",
    "You can turn up anywhere looking pathetic and\nmourning some brave young airman.",
    "Nobody likes to ask you\nquestions.",
    "He turned to another subject.",
    "That sugar hammer or whatnot you sent along  I think youve hit\nthe bullseye.",
    "Its the weapon used in the McGinty murder.",
    "Doctor\nagrees it s exactly suitable for the type of blow.",
    "And there has\nbeen blood on it.",
    "It was washed of course  but they dont realise\nnowadays that a microscopic amount of blood will give a reaction\nwith the latest reagents.",
    "Yes its human blood all right.",
    "And that\nagain ties up with the Wetherbys and the Henderson girl.",
    "Or\ndoesnt it\n\nDeirdre Henderson was quite definite that the sugar hammer\nwent to the Harvest Festival Bring and Buy.",
    "And Mrs Summerhayes was equally positive it was the Christmas\none\n\n\fMrs Summerhayes is never positive about anything said Poirot\ngloomily.",
    "She is a charming person but she has no order or\nmethod in her composition.",
    "But I will tell you this  I who have lived\nat Long Meadows  the doors and the windows they are always\nopen.",
    "Anyone  anyone at all could come and take something\naway and later come and put it back and neither Major\nSummerhayes nor Mrs Summerhayes would notice.",
    "If it is not there\none day she thinks that her husband has taken it to joint a rabbit\nor to chop wood  and he he would think she had taken it to chop\ndogmeat.",
    "In that house nobody uses the right implements  they\njust seize what is at hand and leave it in the wrong place.",
    "And\nnobody remembers anything.",
    "If I were to live like that I should be in\na continual state of anxiety  but they  they do not seem to mind.",
    "Spence sighed.",
    "Well  theres one good thing about all this  they wont execute\nJames Bentley until this business is all cleared up.",
    "Weve\nforwarded a letter to the Home Secretarya office.",
    "It gives us what\nweve been wanting  time.",
    "I think said Poirot that I would like to see Bentley again  now\nthat we know a little more.",
    "II\n\n\fThere was little change in James Bentley.",
    "He was perhaps rather\nthinner his hands were more restless  otherwise he was the same\nquiet hopeless creature.",
    "Hercule Poirot spoke carefully.",
    "There had been some fresh\nevidence.",
    "The police were reopening the case.",
    "There was\ntherefore hope...",
    "But James Bentley was not attracted by hope.",
    "He said\n\nIt will be all no good.",
    "What more can they find out\n\nYour friends said Hercule Poirot are working very hard.",
    "My friends He shrugged his shoulders.",
    "I have no friends.",
    "You should not say that.",
    "You have at the very least two friends.",
    "Two friends I should like to know who they are.",
    "His tone expressed no wish for the information merely a weary\ndisbelief.",
    "First there is Superintendent Spence \n\nSpence Spence The police superintendent who worked up the\ncase against me Thats almost funny.",
    "It is not funny.",
    "It is fortunate.",
    "Spence is a very shrewd and\nconscientious police officer.",
    "He likes to be very sure that he has\ngot the right man.",
    "Hes sure enough of that.",
    "Oddly enough he is not.",
    "That is why as I said he is your friend.",
    "That kind of a friend\n\nHercule Poirot waited.",
    "Even James Bentley he thought must have\nsome human attributes.",
    "Even James Bentley could not be\ncompletely devoid of ordinary human curiosity.",
    "And true enough presently James Bentley said\n\nWell whos the other\n\nThe other is Maude Williams.",
    "Bentley did not appear to react.",
    "Maude Williams Who is she\n\nShe worked in the office of Breather  Scuttle.",
    "Oh  that Miss Williams.",
    "Pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment that Miss Williams.",
    "But whats it got to do with her\n\nThere were moments when Hercule Poirot found the personality of\nJames Bentley so irritating that he heartily wished that he could\nbelieve Bentley guilty of Mrs McGintys murder.",
    "Unfortunately the\nmore Bentley annoyed him the more he came round to Spences\nway of thinking.",
    "He found it more and more difficult to envisage\nBentleys murdering anybody.",
    "James Bentleys attitude to murder\nwould have been Poirot felt sure that it wouldnt be much good\nanyway.",
    "If cockiness as Spence insisted was a characteristic of\nmurderers Bentley was certainly no murderer.",
    "Containing himself Poirot aid\n\nMiss Williams interests herself in the affair.",
    "She is convinced you\nare innocent.",
    "I dont see what she can know about it.",
    "She knows you.",
    "James Bentley blinked.",
    "He said grudgingly\n\nI suppose she does in a way but not well.",
    "You worked together in the office did you not You had\nsometimes meals together\n\nWell  yes  once or twice.",
    "The Blue Cat caf\u00e9 very convenient just across the street.",
    "Did you never go for walks with her\n\nAs a matter of fact we did once.",
    "We walked up on the downs.",
    "Hercule Poirot exploded.",
    "Ma foi is it a crime that I seek to drag from you To keep the\ncompany with a pretty girl is it not natural Is it not enjoyable\nCan you not be pleased with yourself about it\n\nI dont see why said James Bentley.",
    "At your age it is natural and right to enjoy the company of girls.",
    "I dont know many girls.",
    "\u00c7a se voit But you should be ashamed of that not smug You\nknew Miss Williams.",
    "You worked with her and talked with her and\nsometimes had meals with her and once went for a walk on the\ndowns.",
    "And when I mention her you do not even remember her\nname\n\nJames Bentley flushed.",
    "Well you see  Ive never had much to do with girls.",
    "And she isnt\nquite what youd call a lady is she Oh very nice  and all that  but\nI cant help feeling that Mother would have thought her common.",
    "It is what you think that matters.",
    "Again James Bentley flushed.",
    "Her hair he said.",
    "And the kind of clothes she wears  Mother of\ncourse was oldfashioned.",
    "He broke off.",
    "But you found Miss Williams  what shall I say  sympathetic\n\nShe was always very kind said James Bentley slowly.",
    "But she\ndidnt  really  understand.",
    "Her mother died when she was only a\nchild you see.",
    "And then you lost your job said Poirot.",
    "You couldnt get\nanother.",
    "Miss\n\nWilliams\n\nmet\n\nyou\n\nonce\n\nat\n\nBroadhinny\n\nI\n\nunderstand\n\nJames Bentley looked distressed.",
    "Yes  yes.",
    "She was coming over there on business and she sent\nme a postcard.",
    "Asked me to meet her.",
    "I cant think why.",
    "It isnt as\nif I knew her at all well.",
    "But you did meet her\n\nYes.",
    "I didnt want to be rude.",
    "And you took her to the pictures or a meal\n\n\fJames Bentley looked scandalised.",
    "Oh no.",
    "Nothing of that kind.",
    "We  er  just talked whilst she was\nwaiting for her bus.",
    "Ah how amusing that must have been for the poor girl\n\nJames Bentley said sharply\n\nI hadnt got any money.",
    "You must remember that.",
    "I hadnt any\nmoney at all.",
    "Of course.",
    "It was a few days before Mrs McGinty was killed\nwasnt it\n\nJames Bentley nodded.",
    "He said unexpectedly\n\nYes it was on the Monday.",
    "She was killed on Wednesday.",
    "Im going to ask you something else Mr Bentley.",
    "Mrs McGinty\ntook the Sunday Companion.",
    "Yes she did.",
    "Did you ever see her Sunday Companion\n\nShe used to offer it sometimes but I didnt often accept.",
    "Mother\ndidnt care for that kind of paper.",
    "So you didnt see that week s Sunday Companion\n\n\fNo.",
    "And Mrs McGinty didnt speak about it or about anything in it\n\nOh yes she did said James Bentley unexpectedly.",
    "She was full\nof it\n\nAh la la.",
    "So she was full of it.",
    "And what did she say Be careful.",
    "This is important.",
    "I dont remember very well now.",
    "It was all about some old murder\ncase.",
    "Craig I think it was  no perhaps it wasnt Craig.",
    "Anyway\nshe said somebody connected with the case was living in\nBroadhinny now.",
    "Full of it she was.",
    "I couldnt see why it mattered\nto her.",
    "Did she say who it was  in Broadhinny\n\nJames Bentley said vaguely\n\nI think it was that woman whose son writes plays.",
    "She mentioned her by name\n\nNo  I  really its so long ago \n\nI implore you  try to think.",
    "You want to be free again do you not\n\nFree Bentley sounded surprised.",
    "Yes free.",
    "I  yes  I suppose I do \n\nThen think What did Mrs McGinty say\n\nWell  something like  so pleased with herself as she is and so\nproud.",
    "Not so much to be proud of if alls known.",
    "And then Youd\nnever think it was the same woman to look at the photograph.",
    "But\nof course it had been taken years ago.",
    "But what made you sure that it was Mrs Upward of whom she was\nspeaking\n\nI really dont know...",
    "I just formed the impression.",
    "She had been\nspeaking of Mrs Upward  and then I lost interest and didnt listen\nand afterwards  well now I come to think of it I dont really know\nwho she was speaking about.",
    "She talked a lot you know.",
    "Poirot sighed.",
    "He said I do not think myself that it was Mrs Upward of whom she\nspoke.",
    "I think it was somebody else.",
    "It is preposterous to reflect\nthat if you are hanged it will be because you do not pay proper\nattention to the people with whom you converse... Did Mrs McGinty\nspeak much to you of the houses where she worked or the ladies\nof those houses\n\n\fYes in a way  but its no good asking me.",
    "You dont seem to\nrealise M. Poirot that I had my own life to think of at that time.",
    "I\nwas in very serious anxiety.",
    "Not in so much serious anxiety as you are now Did Mrs McGinty\nspeak of Mrs Carpenter  Mrs Selkirk she was then  or of Mrs\nRendell\n\nCarpenter has that new house at the top of the hill and a big car\nhasnt he He was engaged to Mrs Selkirk  Mrs McGinty was\nalways very down on Mrs Selkirk.",
    "I dont know why.",
    "Jumped up\nthats what she used to call her.",
    "I dont know what she meant by it.",
    "And the Rendells\n\nHes the doctor isnt he I dont remember her saying anything\nparticular about them.",
    "And the Wetherbys\n\nI do remember what she said about them.",
    "James Bentley looked\npleased with himself.",
    "No patience with her fusses and her\nfancies thats what she said.",
    "And about him Never a word good\nor bad out of him.",
    "He paused.",
    "She said  it was an unhappy\nhouse.",
    "Hercule Poirot looked up.",
    "For a second James Bentleys voice had\nheld something that Poirot had not heard in it before.",
    "He was not\nrepeating obediently what he could recall.",
    "His mind for a very\nbrief space had moved out of its apathy.",
    "James Bentley was\n\n\fthinking of Hunters Close of the life that went on there of whether\nor not it was an unhappy house.",
    "James Bentley was thinking\nobjectively.",
    "Poirot said softly\n\nYou knew them The mother The father The daughter\n\nNot really.",
    "It was the dog.",
    "A Sealyham.",
    "It got caught in a trap.",
    "She\ncouldnt get it undone.",
    "I helped her.",
    "There was again something new in Bentleys tone.",
    "I helped her\nhe had said and in those words was a faint echo of pride.",
    "Poirot remembered what Mrs Oliver had told him of her\nconversation with Deirdre Henderson.",
    "He said gently\n\nYou talked together\n\nYes.",
    "She  her mother suffered a lot she told me.",
    "She was very\nfond of her mother.",
    "And you told her about yours\n\nYes said James Bentley simply.",
    "Poirot said nothing.",
    "He waited.",
    "Life is very cruel said James Bentley.",
    "Very unfair.",
    "Some people\nnever seem to get any happiness.",
    "It is possible said Hercule Poirot.",
    "I dont think she had had much.",
    "Miss Wetherby.",
    "Henderson.",
    "Oh yes.",
    "She told me she had a stepfather.",
    "Deirdre Henderson said Poirot.",
    "Deirdre of the Sorrows.",
    "A\npretty name  but not a pretty girl I understand\n\nJames Bentley flushed.",
    "I thought he said she was rather goodlooking...\n\nChapter 19\n\nNow just you listen to me said Mrs Sweetiman.",
    "Edna sniffed.",
    "She had been listening to Mrs Sweetiman for some\ntime.",
    "It had been a hopeless conversation going round in circles.",
    "Mrs Sweetiman had said the same things several times varying\nthe phraseology a little but even that not much.",
    "Edna had sniffed\nand occasionally blubbered and had reiterated her own two\n\n\fcontributions to the discussion first that she couldnt ever\nSecond that Dad would skin her alive he would.",
    "Thats as may be said Mrs Sweetiman but murders murder\nand what you saw you saw and you cant get away from it.",
    "Edna sniffed.",
    "And what you did ought to do \n\nMrs Sweetiman broke off and attended to Mrs Wetherby who had\ncome in for some knitting pins and another ounce of wool.",
    "Havent seen you about for some time mam said Mrs\nSweetiman brightly.",
    "No Ive been very far from well lately said Mrs Wetherby.",
    "My\nheart you know.",
    "She sighed deeply.",
    "I have to lie up a great\ndeal.",
    "I heard as youve got some help at last said Mrs Sweetiman.",
    "Youll want dark needles for this light wool.",
    "Yes.",
    "Quite capable as far as she goes and cooks not at all badly.",
    "But her manners And her appearance Dyed hair and the most\nunsuitable tight jumpers.",
    "Ah said Mrs Sweetiman.",
    "Girls arent trained proper to service\nnowadays.",
    "My mother she started at thirteen and she got up at a\nquarter to five every morning.",
    "Head housemaid she was when she\n\n\ffinished and three maids under her.",
    "And she trained them proper\ntoo.",
    "But theres none of that nowadays  girls arent trained\nnowadays theyre just educated like Edna.",
    "Both women looked at Edna who leant against the post office\ncounter\n\nsniffing\n\nand\n\nsucking\n\na\n\npeppermint\n\nand\n\nlooking\n\nparticularly vacant.",
    "As an example of education she hardly did the\neducational system credit.",
    "Terrible about Mrs Upward wasnt it continued Mrs Sweetiman\nconversationally as Mrs Wetherby sorted through various\ncoloured needles.",
    "Dreadful said Mrs Wetherby.",
    "They hardly dared tell me.",
    "And\nwhen they did I had the most frightful palpitations.",
    "Im so\nsensitive.",
    "Shock to all of us it was said Mrs Sweetiman.",
    "As for young Mr\nUpward he took on something terrible.",
    "Had her hands full with\nhim the authoress lady did until the doctor came and give him a\nseddytiff or something.",
    "Hes gone up to Long Meadows now as a\npaying guest felt he couldnt stay in the cottage  and I dont know\nas I blame him.",
    "Janet Groom shes gone home to her niece and the\npolice have got the key.",
    "The lady what writes the murder books\nhas gone back to London but shell come down for the inquest.",
    "Mrs Sweetiman imparted all this information with relish.",
    "She\nprided herself on being well informed.",
    "Mrs Wetherby whose\ndesire for knitting needles had perhaps been prompted by a desire\nto know what was going on paid for her purchase.",
    "Its most upsetting she said.",
    "It makes the whole village so\ndangerous.",
    "There must be a maniac about.",
    "When I think that my\nown dear daughter was out that night that she herself might have\nbeen attacked perhaps killed.",
    "Mrs Wetherby closed both eyes\nand swayed on her feet.",
    "Mrs Sweetiman watched her with interest\nbut without alarm.",
    "Mrs Wetherby opened her eyes again and said\nwith dignity\n\nThis place should be patrolled.",
    "No young people should go about\nafter dark.",
    "And all doors should be locked and bolted.",
    "You know\nthat up at Long Meadows Mrs Summerhayes never locks any of\nher doors.",
    "Not even at night.",
    "She leaves the back door and the\ndrawingroom window open so that the dogs and cats can get in\nand out.",
    "I myself consider that is absolute madness but she says\ntheyve always done it and that if burglars want to get in they\nalways can.",
    "Reckon there wouldnt be much for a burglar to take up at Long\nMeadows said Mrs Sweetiman.",
    "Mrs Wetherby shook her head sadly and departed with her\npurchase.",
    "Mrs Sweetiman and Edna resumed their argument.",
    "Its no good your setting yourself up to know best said Mrs\nSweetiman.",
    "Rights right and murders murder.",
    "Tell the truth and\nshame the devil.",
    "Thats what I say.",
    "Dad would skin me alive he would for sure said Edna.",
    "Id talk to your Dad said Mrs Sweetiman.",
    "I couldnt ever said Edna.",
    "Mrs Upwards dead said Mrs Sweetiman.",
    "And you saw\nsomething the police dont know about.",
    "Youre employed in the\npost office arent you Youre a Government servant.",
    "Youve got to\ndo your duty.",
    "Youve got to go along to Bert Hayling \n\nEdnas sobs burst out anew.",
    "Not to Bert I couldnt.",
    "However could I go to Bert Itd be all over\nthe place.",
    "Mrs Sweetiman said rather hesitantly\n\nTheres that foreign gentleman.",
    "Not a foreigner I couldnt.",
    "Not a foreigner.",
    "No maybe youre right there.",
    "A car drew up outside the post office with a squealing of brakes.",
    "Mrs Sweetimans face lit up.",
    "Thats Major Summerhayes that is.",
    "You tell it all to him and hell\nadvise you what to do.",
    "I couldnt ever said Edna but with less conviction.",
    "Johnnie Summerhayes came into the post office staggering under\nthe burden of three cardboard boxes.",
    "Good morning Mrs Sweetiman he said cheerfully.",
    "Hope these\narent overweight\n\nMrs Sweetiman attended to the parcels in her official capacity.",
    "As\nSummerhayes was licking the stamps she spoke.",
    "Excuse me sir Id like your advice about something.",
    "Yes Mrs Sweetiman\n\nSeeing as you belong here sir and will know best what to do.",
    "Summerhayes nodded.",
    "He was always curiously touched by the\nlingering feudal spirit of English villages.",
    "The villagers knew little\nof him personally but because his father and his grandfather and\nmany greatgreatgrandfathers had lived at Long Meadows they\nregarded it as natural that he should advise and direct when asked\nso to do.",
    "Its about Edna here said Mrs Sweetiman.",
    "Edna sniffed.",
    "Johnnie Summerhayes looked at Edna doubtfully.",
    "Never he\nthought had he seen a more unprepossessing girl.",
    "Exactly like a\nskinned rabbit.",
    "Seemed halfwitted too.",
    "Surely she couldnt be in\nwhat was known officially as trouble.",
    "But no Mrs Sweetiman\nwould not have come to him for advice in that case.",
    "Well he said kindly whats the difficulty\n\nIts about the murder sir.",
    "The night of the murder.",
    "Edna saw\nsomething.",
    "Johnnie Summerhayes transferred his quick dark gaze from Edna\nto Mrs Sweetiman and back again to Edna.",
    "What did you see Edna he said.",
    "Edna began to sob.",
    "Mrs Sweetiman took over.",
    "Of course weve been hearing this and that.",
    "Somes rumour and\nsomes true.",
    "But its said definite as that there were a lady there\nthat night who drank coffee with Mrs Upward.",
    "Thats so isnt it\nsir\n\nYes I believe so.",
    "I know as thats true because we had it from Bert Hayling.",
    "Albert Hayling was the local constable whom Summerhayes knew\nwell.",
    "A slowspeaking man with a sense of his own importance.",
    "I see said Summerhayes.",
    "But they dont know do they who the lady is Well Edna here\nsaw her.",
    "Johnnie Summerhayes looked at Edna.",
    "He pursed his lips as\nthough to whistle.",
    "You saw her did you Edna Going in  or coming out\n\nGoing in said Edna.",
    "A faint sense of importance loosened her\ntongue.",
    "Across the road I was under the trees.",
    "Just by the turn of\nthe lane where its dark.",
    "I saw her.",
    "She went in at the gate and up\nto the door and stood there a bit and then  then she went in.",
    "Johnnie Summerhayes brow cleared.",
    "Thats all right he said.",
    "It was Miss Henderson.",
    "The police know\nall about that.",
    "She went and told them.",
    "Edna shook her head.",
    "It wasnt Miss Henderson she said.",
    "It wasnt  then who was it\n\nI dunno.",
    "I didnt see her face.",
    "Had her back to me she had going\nup the path and standing there.",
    "But it wasnt Miss Henderson.",
    "But how do you know it wasnt Miss Henderson if you didnt see\nher face\n\nBecause she had fair hair.",
    "Miss Hendersons is dark.",
    "Johnnie Summerhayes looked disbelieving.",
    "It was a very dark night.",
    "Youd hardly be able to see the colour of\nanyones hair.",
    "But I did though.",
    "That light was on over the porch.",
    "Left like that it\nwas because Mr Robin and the detective lady had gone out\ntogether to the theatre.",
    "And she was standing right under it.",
    "A\ndark coat she had on and no hat and her hair was shining fair as\ncould be.",
    "I saw it.",
    "Johnnie gave a slow whistle.",
    "His eyes were serious now.",
    "What time was it he asked.",
    "Edna sniffed.",
    "I dont rightly know.",
    "You know about what time said Mrs Sweetiman.",
    "It wasnt nine oclock.",
    "Id have heard the church.",
    "And it was after\nhalfpast eight.",
    "Between halfpast eight and nine.",
    "How long did she stop\n\n\fI dunno sir.",
    "But I didnt wait no longer.",
    "And I didnt hear nothing.",
    "No groans or cries or nothing like that.",
    "Edna sounded slightly aggrieved.",
    "But there would have been no groans and no cries.",
    "Johnnie\nSummerhayes knew that.",
    "He said gravely\n\nWell theres only one thing to be done.",
    "The police have got to\nhear about this.",
    "Edna burst into long sniffling sobs.",
    "Dadll skin me alive she whimpered.",
    "He will for sure.",
    "She cast an imploring look at Mrs Sweetiman and bolted into the\nback room.",
    "Mrs Sweetiman took over with competence.",
    "Its like this sir she said in answer to Summerhayes inquiring\nglance.",
    "Ednas been behaving very foolish like.",
    "Very strict her\nDad is maybe a bit over strict but its hard to say whats best\nnowadays.",
    "Theres a nice young fellow over to Cullavon and he and\nEdna have been going together nice and steady and her Dad was\nquite pleased about it but Reg hes on the slow side and you know\nwhat girls are.",
    "Ednas taken up lately with Charlie Masters.",
    "Masters One of Farmer Coles men isnt he\n\n\fThats right sir.",
    "Farm labourer.",
    "And a married man with two\nchildren.",
    "Always after the girls he is and a bad fellow in every\nway.",
    "Edna hasnt got any sense and her Dad he put a stop to it.",
    "Quite right.",
    "So you see Edna was going into Cullavon that night to\ngo to the pictures with Reg  at least thats what she told her Dad.",
    "But really she went out to meet this Masters.",
    "Waited for him she\ndid at the turn of the lane where it seems they used to meet.",
    "Well\nhe didnt come.",
    "Maybe his wife kept him at home or maybe hes\nafter another girl but there it is.",
    "Edna waited but at last she gave\nup.",
    "But its awkward for her as you can see explaining what she\nwas doing there when she ought to have taken the bus into\nCullavon.",
    "Johnnie Summerhayes nodded.",
    "Suppressing an irrelevant feeling\nof wonder that the unprepossessing Edna could have sufficient sex\nappeal to attract the attention of two men he dealt with the\npractical aspect of the situation.",
    "She doesnt want to go to Bert Hayling about it he said with\nquick comprehension.",
    "Thats right sir.",
    "Summerhayes reflected rapidly.",
    "Im afraid the police have got to know he said gently.",
    "Thats what I told her sir said Mrs Sweetiman.",
    "But they will probably be quite tactful about  er  the\ncircumstances.",
    "Possibly she maynt have to give evidence.",
    "And\nwhat she tells them theyll keep to themselves.",
    "I could ring up\nSpence and ask him to come over here  no better still Ill take\nyoung Edna into Kilchester with me in my car.",
    "If she goes to the\npolice station there nobody here need know anything about it.",
    "Ill\njust ring them up first and warn them were coming.",
    "And so after a brief telephone call the sniffing Edna buttoned\nfirmly into her coat and encouraged by a pat on the back from Mrs\nSweetiman stepped into the station wagon and was driven rapidly\naway in the direction of Kilchester.",
    "Chapter 20\n\nHercule\n\nPoirot\n\nwas\n\nin\n\nSuperintendent\n\nSpences\n\noffice\n\nin\n\nKilchester.",
    "He was leaning back in a chair his eyes closed and the\ntips of his fingers just touching each other in front of him.",
    "The Superintendent received some reports gave instructions to a\nsergeant and finally looked across at the other man.",
    "Getting a brainwave M. Poirot he demanded.",
    "I reflect said Poirot.",
    "I review.",
    "I forgot to ask you.",
    "Did you get anything useful from James\nBentley when you saw him\n\n\fPoirot shook his head.",
    "He frowned.",
    "It was indeed of James Bentley he had been thinking.",
    "It was annoying thought Poirot with exasperation that on a case\nsuch as this where he had offered his services without reward\nsolely out of friendship and respect for an upright police officer\nthat the victim of circumstances should so lack any romantic\nappeal.",
    "A lovely young girl now bewildered and innocent or a\nfine upstanding young man also bewildered but whose head is\nbloody but unbowed thought Poirot who had been reading a\ngood deal of English poetry in an anthology lately.",
    "Instead he had\nJames Bentley a pathological case if there ever was one a selfcentred creature who had never thought much of anyone but\nhimself.",
    "A man ungrateful for the efforts that were being made to\nsave him  almost one might say uninterested in them.",
    "Really thought Poirot one might as well let him be hanged since\nhe does not seem to care...\n\nNo he would not go quite as far as that.",
    "Superintendent Spences voice broke into these reflections.",
    "Our interview said Poirot was if I might say so singularly\nunproductive.",
    "Anything\n\nuseful\n\nthat\n\nBentley\n\nmight\n\nhave\n\nremembered he did not remember  what he did remember is so\nvague and uncertain that one cannot build upon it.",
    "But at any rate\nit seems fairly certain that Mrs McGinty was excited by the article\n\n\fin the Sunday Companion and spoke about it to Bentley with\nspecial reference to someone connected with the case living in\nBroadhinny.",
    "With which case asked Superintendent Spence sharply.",
    "Our friend could not be sure said Poirot.",
    "He said rather\ndoubtfully the Craig case  but the Craig case being the only one\nhe had ever heard of it would presumably be the only one he\ncould remember.",
    "But the someone was a woman.",
    "He even quoted\nMrs McGintys words.",
    "Somebody who had not so much to be\nproud of if alls known.",
    "Proud\n\nMais oui Poirot nodded his appreciation.",
    "A suggestive word is\nit not\n\nNo clue as to who the proud lady was\n\nBentley suggested Mrs Upward  but as far as I can see for no real\nreason\n\nSpence shook his head.",
    "Probably because she was a proud masterful sort of woman outstandingly so I should say.",
    "But it couldnt have been Mrs\nUpward because Mrs Upwards dead and dead for the same\nreason as Mrs McGinty died  because she recognised a\nphotograph.",
    "Poirot said sadly I warned her.",
    "Spence murmured irritably\n\nLily Gamboll So far as age goes there are only two possibilities\nMrs Rendell and Mrs Carpenter.",
    "I dont count the Henderson girl shes got a background.",
    "And the others have not\n\nSpence sighed.",
    "You know what things are nowadays.",
    "The war stirred up everyone\nand everything.",
    "The approved school where Lily Gamboll was and\nall its records were destroyed by a direct hit.",
    "Then take people.",
    "Its the hardest thing in the world to check on people.",
    "Take\nBroadhinny  the only people in Broadhinny we know anything\nabout are the Summerhayes family who have been there for three\nhundred years and Guy Carpenter whos one of the engineering\nCarpenters.",
    "All the others are  what shall I say  fluid Dr Rendells\non the Medical Register and we know where he trained and where\nhes practised but we dont know his home background.",
    "His wife\ncame from near Dublin.",
    "Eve Selkirk as she was before she\nmarried Guy Carpenter was a pretty young war widow.",
    "Anyone\ncan be a pretty young war widow.",
    "Take the Wetherbys  they seem\nto have floated round the world here there and everywhere.",
    "Why\nIs there a reason Did he embezzle from a bank Or did they\noccasion a scandal I dont say we cant dig up about people.",
    "We\ncan  but it takes time.",
    "The people themselves wont help you.",
    "Because they have something to conceal  but it need not be\nmurder said Poirot.",
    "Exactly.",
    "It may be trouble with the law or it may be a humble\norigin or it may be common or garden scandal.",
    "But whatever it is\ntheyve taken a lot of pains to cover up  and that makes it difficult\nto uncover.",
    "But not impossible.",
    "Oh no.",
    "Not impossible.",
    "It just takes time.",
    "As I say if Lily Gamboll\nis in Broadhinny shes either Eve Carpenter or Shelagh Rendell.",
    "Ive questioned them  just routine  thats the way I put it.",
    "They say\nthey were both at home  alone.",
    "Mrs Carpenter was the wideeyed\ninnocent Mrs Rendell was nervous  but then shes a nervous type\nyou cant go by that.",
    "Yes said Poirot thoughtfully.",
    "She is a nervous type.",
    "He was thinking of Mrs Rendell in the garden at Long Meadows.",
    "Mrs Rendell had received an anonymous letter or so she said.",
    "He\nwondered as he had wondered before about that statement.",
    "Spence went on\n\nAnd we have to be careful  because even if one of thems guilty\nthe other is innocent.",
    "And Guy Carpenter is a prospective Member of Parliament and an\nimportant local figure.",
    "That wouldnt help him if he was guilty of murder or accessory to\nit said Spence grimly.",
    "I know that.",
    "But you have have you not to be sure\n\nThats right\u00b7 Anyway youll agree wont you that it lies between\nthe two of them\n\nPoirot sighed.",
    "No  no  I would not say that.",
    "There are other possibilities.",
    "Such as\n\nPoirot was silent for a moment then he said in a different almost\ncasual tone of voice\n\nWhy do people keep photographs\n\nWhy Goodness knows why do people keep all sorts of things junk  trash bits and pieces.",
    "They do  thats all there is to it\n\nUp to a point I agree with you.",
    "Some people keep things.",
    "Some\npeople throw everything away as soon as they have done with it.",
    "That yes it is a matter of temperament.",
    "But I speak now especially\nof photographs.",
    "Why do people keep in particular photographs\n\n\fAs I say because they just dont throw things away.",
    "Or else\nbecause it reminds them \n\nPoirot pounced on the words.",
    "Exactly.",
    "It reminds them.",
    "Now again we ask  why Why does a\nwoman keep a photograph of herself when young And I say that\nthe first reason is essentially vanity.",
    "She has been a pretty girl\nand she keeps a photograph of herself to remind her of what a\npretty girl she was.",
    "It encourages her when her mirror tells her\nunpalatable things.",
    "She says perhaps to a friend That was me\nwhen I was eighteen... and she sighs.",
    "You agree\n\nYes  yes I should say thats true enough.",
    "Then that is reason No.",
    "1.",
    "Vanity.",
    "Now reason No.",
    "2.",
    "Sentiment.",
    "Thats the same thing\n\nNo no not quite.",
    "Because this leads you to preserve not only\nyour own photograph but that of someone else.",
    "A picture of your\nmarried daughter  when she was a child sitting on a hearthrug\nwith tulle round her.",
    "Ive seen some of those Spence grinned.",
    "Yes.",
    "Very embarrassing to the subject sometimes but mothers\nlike to do it.",
    "And sons and daughters often keep pictures of their\nmothers especially say if their mother died young.",
    "This was my\nmother as a girl.",
    "Im beginning to see what youre driving at Poirot.",
    "And there is possibly a third category.",
    "Not vanity not sentiment\nnot love  perhaps hate  what do you say\n\nHate\n\nYes.",
    "To keep a desire for revenge alive.",
    "Someone who has injured\nyou  you might keep a photograph to remind you might you not\n\nBut surely that doesnt apply in this case\n\nDoes it not\n\nWhat are you thinking of\n\nPoirot murmured\n\nNewspaper reports are often inaccurate.",
    "The Sunday Companion\nstated that Eva Kane was employed by the Craigs as a nursery\ngoverness.",
    "Was that actually the case\n\nYes it was.",
    "But were working on the assumption that its Lily\nGamboll were looking for.",
    "Poirot sat up suddenly very straight in his chair.",
    "He wagged an\nimperative forefinger at Spence.",
    "Look.",
    "Look at the photograph of Lily Gamboll.",
    "She is not pretty no Frankly with those teeth and those spectacles she is hideously\nugly.",
    "Then nobody has kept that photograph for the first of our\nreasons.",
    "No woman would keep that photo out of vanity.",
    "If Eve\nCarpenter or Shelagh Rendell who are both goodlooking women\nespecially Eve Carpenter had this photograph of themselves they\nwould tear it in pieces quickly in case somebody should see it\n\nWell there is something in that.",
    "So reason No.",
    "1 is out.",
    "Now take sentiment.",
    "Did anybody love Lily\nGamboll at that age The whole point of Lily Gamboll is that they\ndid not.",
    "She was an unwanted and unloved child.",
    "The person who\nliked her best was her aunt and her aunt died under the chopper.",
    "So it was not sentiment that kept this picture.",
    "And revenge\nNobody hated her either.",
    "Her murdered aunt was a lonely woman\nwithout a husband and with no close friends.",
    "Nobody had hate for\nthe little slum child  only pity.",
    "Look here M. Poirot what youre saying is that nobody would\nhave kept that photo.",
    "Exactly  that is the result of my reflections.",
    "But somebody did.",
    "Because Mrs Upward had seen it.",
    "Had she\n\nDash it all.",
    "It was you who told me.",
    "She said so herself.",
    "Yes she said so said Poirot.",
    "But the late Mrs Upward was in\nsome ways a secretive woman.",
    "She liked to manage things her\nown way.",
    "I showed the photographs and she recognised one of\nthem.",
    "But then for some reason she wanted to keep the\nidentification to herself.",
    "She wanted let us say to deal with a\ncertain situation in the way she fancied.",
    "And so being very quickwitted she deliberately pointed to the wrong picture.",
    "Thereby\nkeeping her knowledge to herself.",
    "But why\n\nBecause as I say she wanted to play a lone hand.",
    "It wouldnt be blackmail She was an extremely wealthy woman\nyou know widow of a North Country manufacturer.",
    "Oh no not blackmail.",
    "More likely beneficence.",
    "Well say that she\nquite liked the person in question and that she didnt want to give\ntheir secret away.",
    "But nevertheless she was curious.",
    "She intended\nto have a private talk with that person.",
    "And whilst doing so to\nmake up her mind whether or not that person had had anything to\ndo with the death of Mrs McGinty.",
    "Something like that.",
    "Then that leaves the other three photos in\n\nPrecisely.",
    "Mrs Upward meant to get in touch with the person in\nquestion at the first opportunity.",
    "That came when her son and Mrs\nOliver went over to the Repertory Theatre at Cullenquay.",
    "And she telephoned to Deirdre Henderson.",
    "That puts Deirdre\nHenderson right back in the picture.",
    "And her mother\n\nSuperintendent Spence shook his head sadly at Poirot.",
    "You do like to make it difficult dont you M. Poirot he said.",
    "Chapter 21\n\nMrs Wetherby walked back home from the post office with a gait\nsurprisingly spry in one habitually reported to be an invalid.",
    "Only when she had entered the front door did she once more\nshuffle feebly into the drawingroom and collapse on the sofa.",
    "The bell was within reach of her hand and she rang it.",
    "Since nothing happened she rang it again this time keeping her\nfinger on it for some time.",
    "In due course Maude Williams appeared.",
    "She was wearing a\nflowered overall and had a duster in her hand.",
    "Did you ring madam\n\nI rang twice.",
    "When I ring I expect someone to come at once.",
    "I\nmight be dangerously ill.\n\n\fIm sorry madam.",
    "I was upstairs.",
    "I know you were.",
    "You were in my room.",
    "I heard you overhead.",
    "And\nyou were pulling the drawers in and out.",
    "I cant think why.",
    "Its no\npart of your job to go prying into my things.",
    "I wasnt prying.",
    "I was putting some of the things you left lying\nabout away tidily.",
    "Nonsense.",
    "All you people snoop.",
    "And I wont have it.",
    "Im feeling\nvery faint.",
    "Is Miss Deirdre in\n\nShe took the dog for a walk.",
    "How stupid.",
    "She might know I would need her.",
    "Bring me an egg\nbeaten up in milk and add a little brandy.",
    "The brandy is on the\nsideboard in the diningroom.",
    "There are only just the three eggs for breakfast tomorrow.",
    "Then someone will have to go without.",
    "Hurry will you Dont\nstand there looking at me.",
    "And youre wearing far too much makeup.",
    "It isnt suitable.",
    "There was a bark in the hall and Deirdre and her Sealyham came in\nas Maude went out.",
    "I heard your voice said Deirdre breathlessly.",
    "What have you\nbeen saying to her\n\n\fNothing.",
    "She looked like thunder.",
    "I put her in her place.",
    "Impertinent girl.",
    "Oh Mummy darling must you Its so difficult to get anyone.",
    "And\nshe does cook well.",
    "I suppose its of no importance that shes insolent to me Oh well I\nshant be with you much longer.",
    "Mrs Wetherby rolled up her eyes\nand took some fluttering breaths.",
    "I walked too far she\nmurmured.",
    "You oughtnt to have gone out darling.",
    "Why didnt you tell me you\nwere going\n\nI thought some air would do me good.",
    "Its so stuffy.",
    "It doesnt\nmatter.",
    "One doesnt really want to live  not if ones only a trouble\nto people.",
    "Youre not a trouble darling.",
    "Id die without you.",
    "Youre a good girl  but I can see how I weary you and get on your\nnerves.",
    "You dont  you dont said Deirdre passionately.",
    "Mrs Wetherby sighed and let her eyelids fall.",
    "I  cant talk much she murmured.",
    "I must just lie still.",
    "Ill hurry up Maude with the egg nog.",
    "Deirdre ran out of the room.",
    "In her hurry she caught her elbow on\na table and a bronze god bumped to the ground.",
    "So clumsy murmured Mrs Wetherby to herself wincing.",
    "The door opened and Mr Wetherby came in.",
    "He stood there for a\nmoment.",
    "Mrs Wetherby opened her eyes.",
    "Oh its you Roger\n\nI wondered what all the noise was in here.",
    "Its impossible to read\nquietly in this house.",
    "It was just Deirdre dear.",
    "She came in with the dog.",
    "Mr Wetherby stooped and picked up the bronze monstrosity from\nthe floor.",
    "Surely Deirdres old enough not to knock things down the whole\ntime.",
    "Shes just rather awkward.",
    "Well its absurd to be awkward at her age.",
    "And cant she keep\nthat dog from barking\n\n\fIll speak to her Roger.",
    "If she makes her home here she must consider our wishes and\nnot behave as though the house belonged to her.",
    "Perhaps youd rather we went away murmured Mrs Wetherby.",
    "Through half closed eyes she watched her husband.",
    "No of course not.",
    "Of course not.",
    "Naturally her home is with us.",
    "I\nonly ask for a little more good sense and good manners.",
    "He\nadded Youve been out Edith\n\nYes.",
    "I just went down to the post office.",
    "No fresh news about poor Mrs Upward\n\nThe police still dont know who it was.",
    "They seem to be quite hopeless.",
    "Any motive Who gets her\nmoney\n\nThe son I suppose.",
    "Yes  yes then it really seems as though it must have been one of\nthese tramps.",
    "You should tell this girl shes got to be careful about\nkeeping the front door locked.",
    "And only to open it on the chain\nwhen it gets near dusk.",
    "These men are very daring and brutal\nnowadays.",
    "Nothing seems to have been taken from Mrs Upwards.",
    "Not like Mrs McGinty said Mrs Wetherby.",
    "Mrs McGinty Oh the charwoman.",
    "Whats Mrs McGinty got to do\nwith Mrs Upward\n\nShe did work for her Roger.",
    "Dont be silly Edith.",
    "Mrs Wetherby closed her eyes again.",
    "As Mr Wetherby went out of\nthe room she smiled to herself.",
    "She opened her eyes with a start to find Maude standing over her\nholding a glass.",
    "Your egg nog madam said Maude.",
    "Her voice was loud and clear.",
    "It echoed too resonantly in the\ndeadened house.",
    "Mrs Wetherby looked up with a vague feeling of alarm.",
    "How tall and unbending the girl was.",
    "She stood over Mrs Wetherby\nlike  like a figure of doom Mrs Wetherby thought to herself  and\nthen wondered why such ordinary words had come into her head.",
    "She raised herself on her elbow and took the glass.",
    "Thank you Maude she said\n\n\fMaude turned and went out of the room.",
    "Mrs Wetherby still felt vaguely upset.",
    "Chapter 22\n\nHercule Poirot took a hired car back to Broadhinny.",
    "He was tired because he had been thinking.",
    "Thinking was always\nexhausting.",
    "And his thinking had not been entirely satisfactory.",
    "It\nwas as though a pattern perfectly visible was woven into a piece\nof material and yet although he was holding the piece of material\nhe could not see what the pattern was.",
    "But it was all there.",
    "That was the point.",
    "It was all there.",
    "Only it was\none of those patterns selfcoloured and subtle that are not easy\nto perceive.",
    "A\n\nlittle\n\nway\n\nout\n\nof\n\nKilchester\n\nhis\n\ncar\n\nencountered\n\nthe\n\nSummerhayes station wagon coming in the opposite direction.",
    "Johnnie was driving and he had a passenger.",
    "Poirot hardly noticed\nthem.",
    "He was still absorbed in thought.",
    "When he got back to Long Meadows he went into the drawingroom.",
    "He removed a colander full of spinach from the most\ncomfortable chair in the room and sat down.",
    "From overhead came\nthe faint drumming of a typewriter.",
    "It was Robin Upward\n\n\fstruggling with a play.",
    "Three versions he had already torn up so\nhe told Poirot.",
    "Somehow he couldnt concentrate.",
    "Robin might feel his mothers death quite sincerely but he\nremained Robin Upward chiefly interested in himself.",
    "Madre he said solemnly would have wished me to go on with\nmy work.",
    "Hercule Poirot had heard many people say much the same thing.",
    "It\nwas one of the most convenient assumptions this knowledge of\nwhat the dead would wish.",
    "The bereaved had never any doubt\nabout their dear ones wishes and those wishes usually squared\nwith their own inclinations.",
    "In this case it was probably true.",
    "Mrs Upward had had great faith\nin Robins work and had been extremely proud of him.",
    "Poirot leaned back and closed his eyes.",
    "He thought of Mrs Upward.",
    "He considered what Mrs Upward had\nreally been like.",
    "He remembered a phrase that he had once heard\nused by a police officer.",
    "Well take him apart and see what makes him tick.",
    "What had made Mrs Upward tick\n\nThere was a crash and Maureen Summerhayes came in.",
    "Her hair\nwas flapping madly.",
    "I cant think whats happened to Johnnie she said.",
    "He just went\ndown to the post office with those special orders.",
    "He ought to have\nbeen back hours ago.",
    "I want him to fix the henhouse door.",
    "A true gentleman Poirot feared would have gallantly offered to fix\nthe henhouse door himself.",
    "Poirot did not.",
    "He wanted to go on\nthinking about two murders and about the character of Mrs\nUpward.",
    "And I cant find that Ministry of Agriculture form continued\nMaureen.",
    "Ive looked everywhere.",
    "The spinach is on the sofa Poirot offered helpfully.",
    "Maureen was not worried about spinach.",
    "The form came last week she mused.",
    "And I must have put it\nsomewhere.",
    "Perhaps it was when I was darning that pullover of\nJohnnies.",
    "She swept over to the bureau and started pulling out the drawers.",
    "Most of the contents she swept on to the floor ruthlessly.",
    "It was\nagony to Hercule Poirot to watch her.",
    "Suddenly she uttered a cry of triumph.",
    "Got it\n\nDelightedly she rushed from the room.",
    "Hercule Poirot sighed and resumed meditation.",
    "To arrange with order and precision \n\nHe frowned.",
    "The untidy heap of objects on the floor by the bureau\ndistracted his mind.",
    "What a way to look for things\n\nOrder and method.",
    "That was the thing.",
    "Order and method...",
    "Though he had turned sideways in his chair he could still see the\nconfusion on the floor.",
    "Sewing things a pile of socks letters\nknitting wool magazines sealing wax photographs a pullover \n\nIt was insupportable\n\nPoirot rose went across to the bureau and with quick deft\nmovements began to return the objects to the open drawers.",
    "The pullover the socks the knitting wool.",
    "Then in the next\ndrawer the sealing wax the photographs the letters \n\nThe telephone rang.",
    "The sharpness of the bell made him jump.",
    "He went across to the telephone and lifted the receiver.",
    "Allo allo allo he said.",
    "The voice that spoke to him was the voice of Superintendent\nSpence.",
    "Ah its you M. Poirot.",
    "Just the man I want.",
    "Spences voice was almost unrecognisable.",
    "A very worried man\nhad given place to a confident one.",
    "Filling me up with a lot of fandangle about the wrong\nphotograph he said with reproachful indulgence.",
    "Weve got\nsome new evidence.",
    "Girl at the post office in Broadhinny.",
    "Major\nSummerhayes just brought her in.",
    "It seems she was standing\npractically opposite the cottage that night and she saw a woman\ngo in.",
    "Sometime after eightthirty and before nine oclock.",
    "And it\nwasnt Deirdre Henderson.",
    "It was a woman with fair hair.",
    "That puts\nus right back where we were  its definitely between the two of\nthem  Eve Carpenter and Shelagh Rendell.",
    "The only question is which\n\nPoirot opened his mouth but did not speak.",
    "Carefully deliberately\nhe replaced the receiver on the stand.",
    "He stood there staring unseeingly in front of him.",
    "The telephone rang again.",
    "Allo Allo Allo\n\nCan I speak to M. Poirot please\n\n\fHercule Poirot speaking.",
    "Thought so.",
    "Maude Williams here.",
    "Post office in a quarter of an\nhour\n\nI will be there.",
    "He replaced the receiver.",
    "He looked down at his feet.",
    "Should he change his shoes His feet\nached a little.",
    "Ah well  no matter.",
    "Resolutely Poirot clapped on his hat and left the house.",
    "On his way down the hill he was hailed by one of Superintendent\nSpences men just emerging from Laburnums.",
    "Morning M. Poirot.",
    "Poirot responded politely.",
    "He noticed that Sergeant Fletcher was\nlooking excited.",
    "The Super sent me over to have a thorough check up he\nexplained.",
    "You know  any little thing we might have missed.",
    "Never know do you Wed been over the desk of course but the\nSuper got the idea there might be a secret drawer  must have\nbeen reading spy stuff.",
    "Well there wasnt a secret drawer.",
    "But\nafter that I got on to the books.",
    "Sometimes people slip a letter into\na book theyre reading.",
    "You know\n\n\fPoirot said that he knew.",
    "And you found something he asked\npolitely.",
    "Not a letter or anything of that sort no.",
    "But I found something\ninteresting  at least I think its interesting.",
    "Look here.",
    "He upwrapped from a piece of newspaper an old and rather\ndecrepit book.",
    "In one of the bookshelves it was.",
    "Old book published years ago.",
    "But look here.",
    "He opened it and showed the flyleaf.",
    "Pencilled\nacross it were the words Evelyn Hope.",
    "Interesting dont you think Thats the name in ease you dont\nremember \n\nThe name that Eva Kane took when she left England.",
    "I do\nremember said Poirot.",
    "Looks as though when Mrs McGinty spotted one of those photos\nhere in Broadhinny it was our Mrs Upward.",
    "Makes it kind of\ncomplicated doesnt it\n\nIt does said Poirot with feeling.",
    "I can assure you that when you\ngo back to Superintendent Spence with this piece of information\nhe will pull out his hair by the roots  yes assuredly by the roots.",
    "I hope it wont be as bad as that said Sergeant Fletcher.",
    "Poirot did not reply.",
    "He went on down the hill.",
    "He had ceased to\nthink.",
    "Nothing anywhere made sense.",
    "He went into the post office.",
    "Maude Williams was there looking at\nknitting patterns.",
    "Poirot did not speak to her.",
    "He went to the stamp\ncounter.",
    "When Maude had made her purchase Mrs Sweetiman\ncame over to him and he bought some stamps.",
    "Maude went out of\nthe shop.",
    "Mrs Sweetiman seemed preoccupied and not talkative.",
    "Poirot was\nable to follow Maude out fairly quickly.",
    "He caught her up a short\ndistance along the road and fell into step beside her.",
    "Mrs Sweetiman looking out of the post office window exclaimed\nto herself disapprovingly.",
    "Those foreigners All the same every\nmanjack of em.",
    "Old enough to be her grandfather he is\n\nII\n\nEh bien said Poirot you have something to tell me\n\nI dont know that its important.",
    "There was somebody trying to get\nin at the window of Mrs Wetherbys room.",
    "When\n\nThis morning.",
    "Shed gone out and the girl was out with the dog.",
    "Old frozen fish was shut up in his study as usual.",
    "Id have been in\n\n\fthe kitchen normally  it faces the other way like the study  but\nactually it seemed a good opportunity to  you understand\n\nPoirot nodded.",
    "So I nipped upstairs and into Her Aciditys bedroom.",
    "There was a\nladder against the window and a man was fumbling with the\nwindow catch.",

    "You are sure it was a man\n\nMaude considered\u00b7\n\nDressed as a man  an old felt hat on.",
    "It might have been a woman\nof course...",
    "It is interesting said Poirot.",
    "It is very interesting...",
    "Nothing\nelse\n\nNot yet.",
    "The junk that old woman keeps Must be dotty She came\nin without me hearing this morning and bawled me out for\n\n\fsnooping.",

    "If anyone asks to be\nmurdered that woman does.",
    "A really nasty bit of goods.",
    "Poirot murmured softly\n\nEvelyn Hope...\n\nWhats that She spun round on him.",
    "So you know that name\n\nWhy  yes... Its the name Eva Whatsername took when she went\nto Australia.",
    "It  it was in the paper  the Sunday Companion.",
    "The Sunday Companion said many things but it did not say that.",
    "The police found the name written in a book in Mrs Upwards\nhouse.",

    "Poirot stood looking after her.",
    "At the post office window Mrs Sweetiman her nose glued to the\npane wondered if that old foreigner had been making suggestions\nof a certain character...\n\nIII\n\nBack at Long Meadows Poirot removed his shoes and put on a\npair of bedroom slippers.",
    "They were not chic not in his opinion\ncomme il faut  but there must be relief.",
    "He sat down on the easychair again and began once more to\nthink.",
    "He had by now a lot to think about.",
    "There were things he had missed  little things \n\nThe pattern was all there.",
    "It only needed cohesion.",
    "Maureen glass in hand talking in a dreamy voice  asking a\nquestion... Mrs Olivers account of her evening at the Rep.

    "She was looking for Hercule Poirot and when she found him she\ndid not beat about the bush.",
    "Look here she said.",
    "Youre a detective and youre supposed to\nbe good.",
    "All right Ill hire you.",

    "Theyre crazy.",
    "They seem to think I\nkilled the Upward woman.",
    "And theyre nosing round asking me all\n\n\fsorts of questions  ferreting out things.",
    "I dont like it.",

    "He was at some\nghastly political meeting that night.",
    "And you\n\nI was just sitting at home.",
    "Listening to the radio actually.",
    "But if you can prove that \n\n\fHow can I prove it I offered the Crofts a fabulous sum to say\ntheyd been in and out and seen me there  the damned swine\nrefused.",
    "That was a very unwise move on your part.",
    "I dont see why.",
    "It would have settled the business.",
    "You have probably convinced your servants that you did commit\nthe murder.",
    "Well  Id paid Croft anyway for \n\nFor what\n\nNothing.",
    "Remember  you want my help.",
    "Oh it was nothing that matters.",
    "But Croft took the message from\nher.",
    "From Mrs Upward\n\nYes.",
    "Asking me to go down and see her that night.",
    "And you say you didnt go\n\nWhy should I go Damned dreary old woman.",

    "When did this message come\n\nWhen I was out.",
    "I dont know exactly when  between five and six I\nthink.",
    "Croft took it.",
    "And you gave him money to forget he had taken that message.",
    "Why\n\nDont be idiotic.",
    "I didnt want to get mixed up in it all.",
    "And then you offer him money to give you an alibi What do you\nsuppose he and his wife think\n\nWho cares what they think\n\nA jury may care said Poirot gravely.",
    "She stared at him.",
    "Youre not serious\n\nI am serious.",
    "Theyd listen to servants  and not to me\n\nPoirot looked at her.",
    "Such crass rudeness and stupidity Antagonising the people who\nmight have been helpful.",
    "A shortsighted stupid policy.",
    "Shortsighted \n\nSuch lovely wide blue eyes.",
    "He said quietly\n\nWhy dont you wear glasses madame You need them.",
    "What Oh I do sometimes.",
    "I did as a child.",
    "And you had then a plate for your teeth.",
    "She stared.",
    "I did as a matter of fact.",
    "Why all this\n\nThe ugly duckling becomes the swan\n\nI was certainly ugly enough.",
    "Did your mother think so\n\nShe said sharply\n\nI dont remember my mother.",
    "What the hell are we talking about\nanyway Will you take on the job\n\nI regret I cannot.",
    "Why cant you\n\nBecause in this affair I act for James Bentley.",
    "James Bentley Oh you mean that halfwit who killed the\ncharwoman.",
    "Whats he got to do with the Upwards\n\nPerhaps  nothing.",
    "Well then Is it a question of money How much\n\nThat is your great mistake madame.",
    "You think always in terms of\nmoney.",
    "You have money and you think that only money counts.",
    "I havent always had money said Eve Carpenter.",
    "No said Poirot.",
    "I thought not.",
    "He nodded his head gently.",
    "That explains a good deal.",
    "It excuses some things...\n\nII\n\nEve Carpenter went out the way she had come blundering a little\nin the light as Poirot remembered her doing before.",
    "Poirot said softly to himself\n\nEvelyn Hope...",
    "So Mrs Upward had rung up both Deirdre Henderson and Evelyn\nCarpenter.",
    "Perhaps she had rung up someone else.",
    "Perhaps \n\nWith a crash Maureen came in.",
    "Its my scissors now.",
    "Sorry lunch is late.",
    "Ive got three pairs and I\ncant find one of them.",
    "She rushed over to the bureau and the process with which Poirot\nwas well acquainted was repeated.",
    "This time the objective was\nattained rather sooner.",
    "With a cry of joy Maureen departed.",
    "Almost automatically Poirot stepped over and began to replace\nthe things in the drawer.",
    "Sealing wax notepaper a work basket\nphotographs \n\nPhotographs...",
    "He stood staring at the photograph he held in his hand.",
    "Footsteps rushed back along the passage.",
    "Poirot could move quickly in spite of his age.",
    "He had dropped the\nphotograph on the sofa put a cushion on it and had himself sat on\nthe cushion by the time that Maureen reentered.",
    "Where the hell Ive put a colander full of spinach \n\nBut it is there madame.",
    "He indicated the colander as it reposed beside him on the sofa.",
    "So thats where I left it.",
    "She snatched it up.",
    "Everything is behind\nhand today...",
    "Her glance took in Hercule Poirot sitting bolt\nupright.",
    "What on earth do you want to sit there for Even on a cushion its\nthe most uncomfortable seat in the room.",
    "All the springs are\nbroken.",
    "I know madame.",
    "But I am  I am admiring that picture on the\nwall.",
    "Maureen glanced up at the oil painting of a naval officer complete\nwith telescope.",
    "Yes  its good.",
    "About the only good thing in the house.",
    "Were not\nsure that it isnt a Gainsborough.",
    "She sighed.",
    "Johnnie wont sell\nit though.",
    "Its his greatgreat and I think a few more greats\ngrandfather and he went down with his ship or did something\nfrightfully gallant.",
    "Johnnies terribly proud of it.",
    "Yes said Poirot gently.",
    "Yes he has something to be proud\nabout your husband\n\nIII\n\n\fIt was three oclock when Poirot arrived at Dr Rendells house.",
    "He had eaten rabbit stew and spinach and hard potatoes and a\nrather peculiar pudding not scorched this time.",
    "Instead The\nwater got in Maureen had explained.",
    "He had drunk half a cup of\nmuddy coffee.",
    "He did not feel well.",
    "The door was opened by the elderly housekeeper Mrs Scott and\nhe asked for Mrs Rendell.",
    "She was in the drawingroom with the radio on and started up\nwhen he was announced.",
    "He had the same impression of her that he had had the first time he\nsaw her.",
    "Wary on her guard frightened of him or frightened of\nwhat he represented.",
    "She seemed paler and more shadowy than she had done.",
    "He was\nalmost certain that she was thinner.",
    "I want to ask you a question madame.",
    "A question Oh Oh yes\n\nDid Mrs Upward telephone to you on the day of her death\n\nShe stared at him.",
    "She nodded.",
    "At what time\n\n\fMrs Scott took the message.",
    "It was about six oclock I think.",
    "What was the message To ask you to go there that evening\n\nYes.",
    "She said that Mrs Oliver and Robin were going into\nKilchester and she would be all alone as it was Janets night out.",
    "Could I come down and keep her company.",
    "Was any time suggested\n\nNine oclock or after.",
    "And you went\n\nI meant to.",
    "I really meant to.",
    "But I dont know how it was I fell fast\nasleep after dinner that night.",
    "It was after ten when I woke up.",
    "I\nthought it was too late.",
    "You did not tell the police about Mrs Upwards call\n\nHer eyes widened.",
    "They had a rather innocent childlike stare.",
    "Ought I to have done Since I didnt go I thought it didnt matter.",
    "Perhaps even I felt rather guilty.",
    "If Id gone she might have been\nalive now.",
    "She caught her breath suddenly.",
    "Oh I hope it wasnt\nlike that.",
    "Not quite like that said Poirot.",
    "He paused and then said\n\n\fWhat are you afraid of Madame\n\nShe caught her breath sharply.",
    "Afraid Im not afraid.",
    "But you are.",
    "What nonsense.",
    "What  what should I be afraid of\n\nPoirot paused for a moment before speaking.",
    "I thought perhaps you might be afraid of me...\n\nShe didnt answer.",
    "But her eyes widened.",
    "Slowly defiantly she\nshook her head.",
    "Chapter 24\n\nThis way to Bedlam said Spence.",
    "It is not as bad as that said Poirot soothingly.",
    "Thats what you say.",
    "Every single bit of information that comes in\nmakes things more difficult.",
    "Now you tell me that Mrs Upward rang\nup three women.",
    "Asked them to come that evening.",
    "Why three\nDidnt she know herself which of them was Lily Gamboll Or isnt it\n\n\fa case of Lily Gamboll at all Take that book with the name of\nEvelyn Hope in it.",
    "It suggests doesnt it that Mrs Upward and Eva\nKane are one and the same.",
    "Which agrees exactly with James Bentleys impression of what\nMrs McGinty said to him.",
    "I thought he wasnt sure.",
    "He was not sure.",
    "It would be impossible for James Bentley to be\nsure of anything.",
    "He did not listen properly to what Mrs McGinty\nwas saying.",
    "Nevertheless if James Bentley had an impression that\nMrs McGinty was talking about Mrs Upward it may very well be\ntrue.",
    "Impressions often are.",
    "Our latest information from Australia it was Australia she went\nto by the way not America seems to be to the effect that the Mrs\nHope in question died out there twenty years ago.",
    "I have already been told that said Poirot.",
    "You always know everything dont you Poirot\n\nPoirot took no notice of this gibe.",
    "He said\n\nAt the one end we have Mrs Hope deceased in Australia  and at\nthe other\n\nAt the other end we have Mrs Upward the widow of a rich North\nCountry manufacturer.",
    "She lived with him near Leeds and had a\n\n\fson.",
    "Soon after the sons birth her husband died.",
    "The boy was\ninclined to be tubercular and since her husbands death she lived\nmostly abroad.",
    "And when does this saga begin\n\nThe saga begins four years after Eve Kane left England.",
    "Upward\nmet his wife somewhere abroad and brought her home after the\nmarriage.",
    "So actually Mrs Upward could be Eva Kane.",
    "What was her maiden\nname\n\nHargraves I understand.",
    "But whats in a name\n\nWhat indeed.",
    "Eva Kane or Evelyn Hope may have died in\nAustralia  but she may have arranged a convenient decease and\nresuscitated herself as Hargraves and made a wealthy match.",
    "Its all a long time ago said Spence.",
    "But supposing that its true.",
    "Supposing she kept a picture of herself and supposing that Mrs\nMcGinty saw it  then one can only assume that she killed Mrs\nMcGinty.",
    "That could be could it not Robin Upward was broadcasting that\nnight.",
    "Mrs Rendell mentions going to the cottage that evening\nremember and not being able to make herself heard.",
    "According to\nMrs Sweetiman Janet Groom told her that Mrs Upward was not\nreally as crippled as she made out.",
    "Thats all very well Poirot but the fact remains that she herself\nwas killed  after recognising a photograph.",
    "Now you want to make\nout that the two deaths are not connected.",
    "No no.",
    "I do not say that.",
    "They are connected all right.",
    "I give it up.",
    "Evelyn Hope.",
    "There is the key to the problem.",
    "Evelyn Carpenter Is that your idea Not Lily Gamboll  but Eva\nKanes daughter But surely she wouldnt kill her own mother.",
    "No no.",
    "This is not matricide.",
    "What an irritating devil you are Poirot.",
    "Youll be saying next that\nEva Kane and Lily Gamboll and Janice Courtland and Vera Blake\nare all living in Broadhinny.",
    "All four suspects.",
    "We have more than four.",
    "Eva Kane was the Craigs nursery\ngoverness remember.",
    "Whats that got to do with it\n\nWhere there is a nursery governess there must be children  or at\nleast a child.",
    "What happened to the Craig children\n\nThere was a girl and a boy I believe.",
    "Some relative took them.",
    "So there are two more people to take into account.",
    "Two people\nwho might have kept a photograph for the third reason I mentioned\n revenge.",
    "I dont believe it said Spence.",
    "Poirot sighed.",
    "It has to be considered all the same.",
    "I think I know the truth though there is one fact that baffles me utterly.",
    "Im glad something baffles you said Spence.",
    "Confirm one thing for me mon cher Spence.",
    "Eva Kane left the\ncountry before Craigs execution that is right\n\nQuite right.",
    "And she was at that time expecting a child\n\nQuite right.",
    "Bon Dieu how stupid I have been said Hercule Poirot.",
    "The\nwhole thing is simple is it not\n\nIt was after that remark that there was very nearly a third murder the murder of Hercule Poirot by Superintendent Spence in\nKilchester Police Headquarters.",
    "II\n\nI want said Hercule Poirot a personal call.",
    "To Mrs Ariadne\nOliver.",
    "A personal call to Mrs Oliver was not achieved without difficulties.",
    "Mrs Oliver was working and could not be disturbed.",
    "Poirot\nhowever disregarded all denials.",
    "Presently he heard the\nauthoresss voice.",
    "It was cross and rather breathless.",
    "Well what is it said Mrs Oliver.",
    "Have you got to ring me up just\nnow Ive thought of a most wonderful idea for a murder in a\ndrapers shop.",
    "You know the oldfashioned kind that sells\ncombinations and funny vests with long sleeves.",
    "I do not know said Poirot.",
    "And anyway what I have to say to you\nis far more important.",
    "It couldnt be said Mrs Oliver.",
    "Not to me I mean.",
    "Unless I get a\nrough sketch of my idea jotted down it will go\n\nHercule Poirot paid no attention to this creative agony.",
    "He asked\nsharp imperative questions to which Mrs Oliver replied somewhat\nvaguely.",
    "Yes  yes  its a little Repertory Theatre  I dont know its name...\nWell one of them was Cecil Something and the one I was talking\nto was Michael.",
    "Admirable.",
    "That is all I need to know.",
    "But why Cecil and Michael\n\nReturn to the combinations and the longsleeved vests madame.",
    "I cant think why you dont arrest Dr Rendell said Mrs Oliver.",
    "I\nwould if I were the Head of Scotland Yard.",
    "Very possibly.",
    "I wish you luck with the murder in the drapers\nshop.",
    "The whole idea has gone now said Mrs Oliver.",
    "Youve ruined it.",
    "Poirot apologised handsomely.",
    "He put down the receiver and smiled at Spence.",
    "We go now  or at least I will go  to interview a young actor whose\nChristian name is Michael and who plays the less important parts\nin the Cullenquay Repertory Theatre.",
    "I pray only that he is the right\nMichael.",
    "Why on earth \n\n\fPoirot dexterously averted the rising wrath of Superintendent\nSpence.",
    "Do you know cher ami what is a secret de Polichinelle\n\nIs\n\nthis\n\na\n\nFrench lesson\n\ndemanded the\n\nsuperintendent\n\nwrathfully.",
    "A secret de Polichinelle is a secret that everyone can know.",
    "For\nthis reason the people who do not know it never hear about it  for\nif everyone thinks you know a thing nobody tells you.",
    "How I manage to keep my hands off you I dont know said\nSuperintendent Spence.",
    "Chapter 25\n\nThe inquest was over  a verdict had been returned of murder by a\nperson or persons unknown.",
    "After the inquest at the invitation of Hercule Poirot those who had\nattended it came to Long Meadows.",
    "Working diligently Poirot had induced some semblance of order in\nthe long drawingroom.",
    "Chairs had been arranged in a neat semicircle Maureens dogs had been excluded with difficulty and\nHercule Poirot a selfappointed lecturer took up his position at\n\n\fthe end of the room and initiated proceedings with a slightly selfconscious clearing of the throat.",
    "Messieurs et Mesdames \n\nHe paused.",
    "His next words were unexpected and seemed almost\nfarcical.",
    "Mrs McGintys dead.",
    "How did she die\n\nDown on her knees just like I.\n\nMrs McGintys dead.",
    "How did she die\n\nHolding her hand out just like I.\n\nMrs McGintys dead.",
    "How did she die\n\nLike this...",
    "Seeing their expressions he went on\n\nNo I am not mad.",
    "Because I repeat to you the childish rhyme of a\nchildish game it does not mean that I am in my second childhood.",
    "Some of you may have played that game as children.",
    "Mrs Upward\nhad played it.",
    "Indeed she repeated it to me  with a difference.",
    "She\nsaid Mrs McGintys dead.",
    "How did she die Sticking her neck out\n\n\fjust like I.",
    "That is what she said  and that is what she did.",
    "She\nstuck her neck out  and so she also like Mrs McGinty died...\n\nFor our purpose we must go back to the beginning  to Mrs\nMcGinty  down on her knees scrubbing other peoples houses.",
    "Mrs McGinty was killed and a man James Bentley was arrested\ntried and convicted.",
    "For certain reasons Superintendent Spence\nthe officer in charge of the case was not convinced of Bentleys\nguilt strong though the evidence was.",
    "I agreed with him.",
    "I came\ndown here to answer a question.",
    "How did Mrs McGinty die Why\ndid she die\n\nI will not make you the long and complicated histories.",
    "I will say\nonly that as simple a thing as a bottle of ink gave me a clue.",
    "In the\nSunday Companion read by Mrs McGinty on the Sunday before\nher death four photographs were published.",
    "You know all about\nthose photographs by now so I will only say that Mrs McGinty\nrecognised one of those photographs as a photograph she had\nseen in one of the houses where she worked.",
    "She spoke of this to James Bentley though he attached no\nimportance to the matter at the time nor indeed afterwards.",
    "Actually he barely listened.",
    "But he had the impression that Mrs\nMcGinty had seen the photograph in Mrs Upwards house and that\nwhen she referred to a woman who need not be so proud if all was\nknown she was referring to Mrs Upward.",
    "We cannot depend on\nthat statement of his but she certainly used that phrase about\npride and there is no doubt that Mrs Upward was a proud and\nimperious woman.",
    "As you all know  some of you were present and the others will\nhave heard  I produced those four photographs at Mrs Upwards\nhouse.",
    "I caught a flicker of surprise and recognition in Mrs\nUpwards expression and taxed her with it.",
    "She had to admit it.",
    "She\nsaid that she had seen one of the photographs somewhere but she\ncouldnt remember where.",
    "When asked which photograph she\npointed to a photograph of the child Lily Gamboll.",
    "But that let me\ntell you was not the truth.",
    "For reasons of her own Mrs Upward\nwanted to keep her recognition to herself.",
    "She pointed to the\nwrong photograph to put me off.",
    "But one person was not deceived  the murderer.",
    "One person\nknew which photograph Mrs Upward had recognised.",
    "And here I\nwill not beat to and fro about the bush  the photograph in question\nwas that of Eva Kane  a woman who was accomplice victim or\npossibly leading spirit in the famous Craig Murder Case.",
    "On the next evening Mrs Upward was killed.",
    "She was killed for the\nsame reason that Mrs McGinty was killed.",
    "Mrs McGinty stuck her\nhand out Mrs Upward stuck her neck out  the result was the\nsame.",
    "Now before Mrs Upward died three women received telephone\ncalls.",
    "Mrs Carpenter Mrs Rendell and Mrs Henderson.",
    "All three\ncalls were a message from Mrs Upward asking the person in\nquestion to come and see her that evening.",
    "It was her servants\nnight out and her son and Mrs Oliver were going into Cullenquay.",
    "It\nwould seem therefore that she wanted a private conversation\nwith each of these three women.",
    "Now why three women Did Mrs Upward know where she had\nseen the photograph of Eva Kane Or did she know she had seen it\nbut could not remember where Had these three women anything\nin common Nothing it would seem but their age.",
    "They were all\nroughly in the neighbourhood of thirty.",
    "You have perhaps read the article of the Sunday Companion.",
    "There is a truly sentimental picture in it of Eva Kanes daughter in\nyears to come.",
    "The women asked by Mrs Upward to come and see\nher were all of the right age to be Eva Kanes daughter.",
    "So it would seem that living in Broadhinny was a young woman\nwho was the daughter of the celebrated murderer Craig and of his\nmistress Eva Kane and it would also seem that that young woman\nwould go to any lengths to prevent that fact being known.",
    "Would\ngo indeed to the length of twice committing murder.",
    "For when\nMrs Upward was found dead there were two coffee cups on the\ntable both used and on the visitors cup faint traces of lipstick.",
    "Now let us go back to the three women who received telephone\nmessages.",
    "Mrs Carpenter got the message but says she did not go\nto Laburnums that night.",
    "Mrs Rendell meant to go but fell asleep in\nher chair.",
    "Miss Henderson did go to Laburnums but the house was\ndark and she could not make anyone hear and she came away\nagain.",
    "That is the story these three women tell  but there is conflicting\nevidence.",
    "There is that second coffee cup with lipstick on it and\nan outside witness the girl Edna states positively that she saw a\nfairhaired woman go in to the house.",
    "There is also the evidence of\n\n\fscent  an expensive and exotic scent which Mrs Carpenter uses\nalone of those concerned.",
    "There was an interruption.",
    "Eve Carpenter cried out\n\nIts a lie.",
    "Its a wicked cruel lie.",
    "It wasnt me I never went there I\nnever went near the place.",
    "Guy cant you do something about\nthese lies\n\nGuy Carpenter was white with anger.",
    "Let me inform you M. Poirot that there is a law of slander and all\nthese people present are witnesses.",
    "Is it slander to say that your wife uses a certain scent  and also\nlet me tell you a certain lipstick\n\nIts ridiculous cried Eve.",
    "Absolutely ridiculous Anyone could\ngo splashing my scent about.",
    "Unexpectedly Poirot beamed on her.",
    "Mais oui exactly Anyone could.",
    "An obvious not very subtle thing\nto do.",
    "Clumsy and crude.",
    "So clumsy that as far as I was\nconcerned it defeated its object.",
    "It did more.",
    "It gave me as the\nphrase goes ideas.",
    "Yes it gave me ideas.",
    "Scent  and traces of lipstick on a cup.",
    "But it is so easy to remove\nlipstick from a cup  I assure you every trace can be wiped off quite\neasily.",
    "Or the cups themselves could be removed and washed.",
    "Why not There was no one in the house.",
    "But that was not done.",
    "I\nasked myself why And the answer seemed to be a deliberate\nstress on femininity an underlining of the fact that it was a\nwomans murder.",
    "I reflected on the telephone calls to those three\nwomen  all of them had been messages.",
    "In no case had the\nrecipient herself spoken to Mrs Upward.",
    "So perhaps it was not Mrs\nUpward who had telephoned.",
    "It was someone who was anxious to\ninvolve a woman  any woman  in the crime.",
    "Again I asked why\nAnd there can be only one answer  that it was not a woman who\nkilled Mrs Upward  but a man.",
    "He looked round on his audience.",
    "They were all very still.",
    "Only two\npeople responded.",
    "Eve Carpenter said with a sigh Now youre talking sense\n\nMrs Oliver nodding her head vigorously said Of course.",
    "So I have arrived at this point  a man killed Mrs Upward and a\nman killed Mrs McGinty What man The reason for the murder\nmust still be the same  it all hinges on a photograph.",
    "In whose\nposession was that photograph That is the first question.",
    "And\nwhy was it kept\n\nWell that is perhaps not o difficult.",
    "Say that it was kept originally\nfor sentimental reasons.",
    "Once Mrs McGinty is  removed the\nphotograph need not be destroyed.",
    "But after the second murder it\nis different.",
    "This time the photograph has definitely been\nconnected with the murder.",
    "The photograph is now a dangerous\n\n\fthing to keep.",
    "Therefore you will all agree it is sure to be\ndestroyed.",
    "He looked round at the heads that nodded agreement.",
    "But for all that the photograph was not destroyed No it was not\ndestroyed I know that  because I found it.",
    "I found it a few days\nago.",
    "I found it in this house.",
    "In the drawer of the bureau that you\nsee standing against the wall.",
    "I have it here.",
    "He held out the faded photograph of a simpering girl with roses.",
    "Yes said Poirot.",
    "It is Eva Kane.",
    "And on the back of it are written\ntwo words in pencil.",
    "Shall I tell you what they are My mother...\n\nHis eyes grave and accusing rested on Maureen Summerhayes.",
    "She pushed back the hair from her face and stared at him with\nwide bewildered eyes.",
    "I dont understand.",
    "I never \n\nNo Mrs Summerhayes you do not understand.",
    "There can be only\ntwo reasons for keeping this photograph after the second murder.",
    "The first of them is an innocent sentimentality.",
    "You had no feeling\nof guilt and so you could keep the photograph.",
    "You told us\nyourself at Mrs Carpenters house one day that you were an\nadopted child.",
    "I doubt whether you have ever known what your\nreal mothers name was.",
    "But somebody else knew.",
    "Somebody who\nhas all the pride of family  a pride that makes him cling to his\nancestral home a pride in his ancestors and his lineage.",
    "That man\n\n\fwould rather die than have the world  and his children  know that\nMaureen Summerhayes is the daughter of the murderer Craig and\nof Eva Kane.",
    "That man I have said would rather die.",
    "But that\nwould not help would it So instead let us say that we have here a\nman who is prepared to kill.",
    "Johnnie Summerhayes got up from his seat.",
    "His voice when he\nspoke was quiet almost friendly.",
    "Rather a lot of nonsense youre talkin arent you Enjoying\nyourself spouting out a lot of theories Theories thats all they are\nSaying things about my wife \n\nHis anger broke suddenly in a furious tide.",
    "You damned filthy swine \n\nThe swiftness of his rush across the floor took the room unawares.",
    "Poirot skipped back nimbly and Superintendent Spence was\nsuddenly between Poirot and Summerhayes.",
    "Now now Major Summerhayes take it easy  take it easy \n\nSummerhayes recovered himself shrugged said\n\nSorry.",
    "Ridiculous really After all  anyone can stick a photograph\nin a drawer.",
    "Precisely said Poirot.",
    "And the interesting thing about this\nphotograph is that it has no fingerprints on it.",
    "He paused then\nnodded his head gently.",
    "But it should have had he said.",
    "If Mrs Summerhayes kept it she\nwould have kept it innocently and so her fingerprints should have\nbeen on it.",
    "Maureen exclaimed\n\nI think youre mad.",
    "Ive never seen that photograph in my life except at Mrs Upwards that day.",
    "It is fortunate for you said Poirot that I know that you are\nspeaking the truth.",
    "The photograph was put into that drawer only a\nfew minutes before I found it there.",
    "Twice that morning the\ncontents of that drawer were tumbled on to the ground twice I\nreplaced them the first time the photograph was not in the\ndrawer the second time it was.",
    "It had been placed there during\nthat interval  and I know by whom.",
    "A new note crept into his voice.",
    "He was no longer a ridiculous little\nman with an absurd moustache and dyed hair he was a hunter\nvery close to his quarry.",
    "The crimes were committed by a man  they were commited for\nthe simplest of all reasons  for money.",
    "In Mrs Upwards house\nthere was a book found and on the flyleaf of that book is written\nEvelyn Hope.",
    "Hope was the name Eva Kane took when she left\nEngland.",
    "If her real name was Evelyn then in all probability she\n\n\fgave the name of Evelyn to her child when it was born.",
    "But Evelyn\nis a mans name as well as a womans.",
    "Why had we assumed that\nEva Kanes child was a girl Roughly because the Sunday\nCompanion said so But actually the Sunday Companion had not\nsaid so in so many words it had assumed it because of a to\nromantic interview with Eva Kane.",
    "But Eva Kane left England\nbefore her child was born  so nobody could say what the sex of\nthe child would be.",
    "That is where I let myself be misled.",
    "By the romantic inaccuracy\nof the Press.",
    "Evelyn Hope Eva Kanes son comes to England.",
    "He is talented\nand he attracts the attention of a very rich woman who knows\nnothing about his origin  only the romantic story he chooses to tell\nher.",
    "A very pretty little story it was  all about a tragic young\nballerina dying of tuberculosis in Paris\n\nShe is a lonely woman who has recently lost her own son.",
    "The\ntalented young playwright takes her name by deed poll.",
    "But your real name is Evelyn Hope isnt it Mr Upward\n\nRobin Upward cried out shrilly\n\nOf course it isnt I dont know what youre talking about.",
    "You really cannot hope to deny it.",
    "There are people who know you\nunder that name.",
    "The name Evelyn Hope written in the book is in\nyour handwriting  the same handwriting as the words my mother\n\n\fon the back of this photograph.",
    "Mrs McGinty saw the photograph\nand the writing on it when she was tidying your things away.",
    "She\nspoke to you about it after reading the Sunday Companion.",
    "Mrs\nMcGinty assumed that it was a photograph of Mrs Upward when\nyoung since she had no idea Mrs Upward was not your real\nmother.",
    "But you knew that if once she mentioned the matter so\nthat it came to Mrs Upwards ears it would be the end.",
    "Mrs\nUpward had quite fanatical views on the subject of heredity.",
    "She\nwould not tolerate for a moment an adopted son who was the son\nof a famous murderer.",
    "Nor would she forgive your lies on the\nsubject.",
    "So Mrs McGinty had at all costs to be silenced.",
    "You promised her\na little present perhaps for being discreet.",
    "You called on her the\nnext evening on your way to broadcast  and you killed her Like\nthis...\n\nWith a sudden movement Poirot seized the sugar hammer from\nthe shelf and whirled it round and down as though to bring it\ncrashing down on Robins head.",
    "So menacing was the gesture that several of the circle cried out.",
    "Robin Upward screamed.",
    "A high terrified scream.",
    "He yelled Dont... dont...",
    "It was an accident.",
    "I swear it was an\naccident.",
    "I didnt mean to kill her.",
    "I lost my head.",
    "I swear I did.",
    "You washed off the blood and put the sugar hammer back in this\nroom where you had found it.",
    "But there are new scientific methods\n\n\fof determining blood stains  and of bringing up latent\nfingerprints.",
    "I tell you I never meant to kill her...",
    "It was all a mistake... And\nanyway it isnt my fault... Im not responsible.",
    "Its in my blood.",
    "I can\nt help it.",
    "You cant hang me for something that isnt my fault...",
    "Under his breath Spence muttered Cant we You see if we\ndont\n\nAloud he spoke in a grave official voice\n\nI must warn you Mr Upward that anything you say...\n\nChapter 26\n\nI really dont see M. Poirot how ever you came to suspect Robin\nUpward.",
    "Poirot looked complacently at the faces turned towards him.",
    "He always enjoyed explanations.",
    "I ought to have suspected him much sooner.",
    "The clue such a\nsimple clue was the sentence uttered by Mrs Summerhayes at the\ncocktail party that day.",
    "She said to Robin Upward I dont like\nbeing adopted do you Those were the revealing two words.",
    "Do\n\n\fyou They meant  they could only mean  that Mrs Upward was not\nRobins own mother.",
    "Mrs Upward was morbidly anxious herself that no one should\nknow that Robin was not her own son.",
    "She had probably heard too\nmany ribald comments on brilliant young men who live with and\nupon elderly women.",
    "And very few people did know  only the small\ntheatrical coterie where she had first come across Robin.",
    "She had\nfew intimate friends in this country having lived abroad so long\nand she chose in any case to come and settle down here far away\nfrom her own Yorkshire.",
    "Even when she met friends of the old\ndays she did not enlighten them when they assumed that this\nRobin was the same Robin they had known as a little boy.",
    "But from the very first something had struck me as not quite\nnatural in the household at Laburnums.",
    "Robins attitude to Mrs\nUpward was not that of either a spoiled child or of a devoted son.",
    "It was the attitude of a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 to a patron.",
    "The rather fanciful title\nof Madre had a theatrical touch.",
    "And Mrs Upward though she was\nclearly very fond of Robin nevertheless unconsciously treated him\nas a prized possession that she had bought and paid for.",
    "So there is Robin Upward comfortably established with Madres\npurse to back his ventures and then into his assured world comes\nMrs McGinty who has recognised the photograph that he keeps in\na drawer  the photograph with my mother written on the back of\nit.",
    "His mother whom he has told Mrs Upward was a talented young\nballet dancer who died of tuberculosis Mrs McGinty of course\nthinks that the photograph is of Mrs Upward when young since\nshe assumes as a matter of course that Mrs Upward is Robins own\n\n\fmother.",
    "I do not think that actual blackmail ever entered Mrs\nMcGintys mind but she did hope perhaps for a nice little\npresent as a reward for holding her tongue about a piece of\nbygone gossip which would not have been pleasant for a proud\nwoman like Mrs Upward.",
    "But Robin Upward was taking no chances.",
    "He purloins the sugar\nhammer laughingly referred to as a perfect weapon for murder by\nMrs Summerhayes and on the following evening he stops at Mrs\nMcGintys cottage on his way to broadcast.",
    "She takes him into the\nparlour quite unsuspicious and he kills her.",
    "He knows where she\nkeeps her savings  everyone in Broadhinny seems to know  and\nhe fakes a burglary hiding the money outside the house.",
    "Bentley is\nsuspected and arrested.",
    "Everything is now safe for clever Robin\nUpward.",
    "But then suddenly I produce four photographs and Mrs Upward\nrecognises the one of Eva Kane as being identical with a\nphotograph of Robins ballerina mother She needs a little time to\nthink things out.",
    "Murder is involved.",
    "Can it be possible that Robin  No she refuses to believe it.",
    "What action she would have taken in the end we do not know.",
    "But\nRobin was taking no chances.",
    "He plans the whole mise en sc\u00e8ne.",
    "The visit to the Rep on Janets night out the telephone calls the\ncoffee cup carefully smeared with lipstick taken from Eve\nCarpenters bag he even buys a bottle of her distinctive perfume.",
    "The whole thing was a theatrical scene setting with prepared\nprops.",
    "Whilst Mrs Oliver waited in the car Robin ran back twice\ninto the house.",
    "The murder was a matter of seconds.",
    "After that\n\n\fthere was only the swift distribution of the props.",
    "And with Mrs\nUpward dead he inherited a large fortune by the terms of her will\nand no suspicion could attach to him since it would seem quite\ncertain that a woman had committed the crime.",
    "With three women\nvisiting the cottage that night one of them was almost sure to be\nsuspected.",
    "And that indeed was so.",
    "But Robin like all criminals was careless and over confident.",
    "Not\nonly was there a book in the cottage with his original name\nscribbled in it but he also kept for purposes of his own the fatal\nphotograph.",
    "It would have been much safer for him if he had\ndestroyed it but he clung to the belief that he could use it to\nincriminate someone else at the right moment.",
    "He probably thought then of Mrs Summerhayes.",
    "That may be the\nreason he moved out of the cottage and into Long Meadows.",
    "After\nall the sugar hammer was hers and Mrs Summerhayes was he\nknew an adopted child and might find it hard to prove she was not\nEva Kanes daughter.",
    "However when Deirdre Henderson admitted having been on the\nscene of the crime he conceived the idea of planting the\nphotograph amongst her possessions.",
    "He tried to do so using a\nladder that the gardener had left against the window.",
    "But Mrs\nWetherby was nervous and had insisted on all the windows being\nkept locked so Robin did not succeed in his purpose.",
    "He came\nstraight back here and put the photograph in a drawer which\nunfortunately for him I had searched only a short time before.",
    "I knew therefore that the photograph had been planted and I\nknew by whom  by the only other person in the house  that person\nwho was typing industriously over my head.",
    "Since the name Evelyn Hope had been written on the flyleaf of the\nbook from the cottage Evelyn Hope must be either Mrs Upward or Robin Upward...",
    "The name Evelyn had led me astray  I had connected it with Mrs\nCarpenter since her name was Eve.",
    "But Evelyn was a mans name\nas well as a womans.",
    "I remembered the conversation Mrs Oliver had told me about at\nthe Little Rep in Cullenquay.",
    "The young actor who had been talking\nto her was the person I wanted to confirm my theory  the theory\nthat Robin was not Mrs Upwards own son.",
    "For by the way he had\ntalked it seemed clear that he knew the real facts.",
    "And his story of\nMrs Upwards swift retribution on a young man who had deceived\nher as to his origins was suggestive.",
    "The truth is that I ought to have seen the whole thing very much\nsooner.",
    "I was handicapped by a serious error.",
    "I believed that I had\nbeen deliberately pushed with the intention of sending me on to a\nrailway line  and that the person who had done so was the\nmurderer of Mrs McGinty.",
    "Now Robin Upward was practically the\nonly person in Broadhinny who could not have been at Kilchester\nstation at that time.",
    "There was a sudden chuckle from Johnnie Summerhayes.",
    "Probably some old market woman with a basket.",
    "They do shove.",
    "Poirot said\n\nActually Robin Upward was far too conceited to fear me at all.",
    "It\nis a characteristic of murderers.",
    "Fortunately perhaps.",
    "For in this\ncase there was very little evidence.",
    "Mrs Oliver stirred.",
    "Do you mean to say she demanded incredulously that Robin\nmurdered his mother whilst I sat outside in the car and that I\nhadnt the least idea of it There wouldnt have been time\n\nOh yes there would.",
    "Peoples ideas of time are usually\nludicrously wrong.",
    "Just notice some time how swiftly a stage can\nbe reset.",
    "In this case it was mostly a matter of props.",
    "Good theatre murmured Mrs Oliver mechanically.",
    "Yes it was preeminently a theatrical murder.",
    "All very much\ncontrived.",
    "And I sat there in the car  and hadnt the least idea\n\nI am afraid murmured Poirot that your womans intuition was\ntaking a day off...\n\nChapter 27\n\n\fIm not going back to Breather  Scuttle said Maude Williams.",
    "Theyre a lousy firm anyway.",
    "And they have served their purpose.",
    "What do you mean by that M. Poirot\n\nWhy did you come to this part of the world\n\nI suppose being Mr Knowall you think you know\n\nI have a little idea.",
    "And what is this famous idea\n\nPoirot was looking meditatively at Maudes hair.",
    "I have been very discreet he said.",
    "It has been assumed that the\nwoman who went into Mrs Upwards house the fairhaired woman\nthat Edna saw was Mrs Carpenter and that she has denied being\nthere simply out of fright.",
    "Since it was Robin Upward who killed\nMrs Upward her presence has no more significance than that of\nMiss Henderson.",
    "But all the same I do not think she was there.",
    "I\nthink Miss Williams that the woman Edna saw was you.",
    "Why me\n\nHer voice was hard.",
    "Poirot countered with another question.",
    "Why were you so interested in Broadhinny Why when you went\nover there did you ask Robin Upward for an autograph  you are\nnot the autographhunting type.",
    "What did you know about the\nUpwards Why did you come to this part of the world in the first\nplace How did you know that Eva Kane died in Australia and the\nname she took when she left England\n\nGood at guessing arent you Well Ive nothing to hide not\nreally.",
    "She opened her handbag.",
    "From a worn notecase she pulled out a\nsmall newspaper cutting frayed with age.",
    "It showed the face that\nPoirot by now knew so well the simpering of Eva Kane.",
    "Written across it were the words She killed my mother...\n\nPoirot handed it back to her.",
    "Yes I thought so.",
    "Your real name is Craig\n\nMaude nodded.",
    "I was brought up by some cousins  very decent they were.",
    "But I\nwas old enough when it all happened not to forget.",
    "I used to think\nabout it a good deal.",
    "About her.",
    "She was a nasty bit of goods all\nright  children know My father was just  weak.",
    "And besotted by\nher.",
    "But he took the rap.",
    "For something Ive always believed that\n\n\fshe did.",
    "Oh yes I know hes an accessory after the fact  but its\nnot quite the same thing is it I always meant to find out what had\nbecome of her.",
    "When I was grown up I got detectives on to it.",
    "They\ntraced her to Australia and finally reported that she was dead.",
    "Shed left a son  Evelyn Hope he called himself.",
    "Well that seemed to close the account.",
    "But then I got pally with a\nyoung actor chap.",
    "He mentioned someone called Evelyn Hope\nwhod come from Australia but who now called himself Robin\nUpward and who wrote plays.",
    "I was interested.",
    "One night Robin\nUpward was pointed out to me  and he was with his mother.",
    "So I\nthought that after all Eva Kane wasnt dead.",
    "Instead she was\nqueening it about with a packet of money.",
    "I got myself a job down here.",
    "I was curious  and a bit more than\ncurious.",
    "All right Ill admit it I thought Id like to get even with her\nin some way...",
    "When you brought up all this business about James\nBentley I jumped to the conclusion that it was Mrs Upward whod\nkilled Mrs McGinty.",
    "Eva Kane up to her tricks again.",
    "I happened to\nhear from Michael West that Robin Upward and Mrs Oliver were\ncoming over to this show at the Cullenquay Rep.",
    "I decided to go to\nBroadhinny and beard the woman.",
    "I meant  I dont quite know\nwhat I meant.",
    "Im telling you everything  I took a little pistol I had in\nthe war with me.",
    "To frighten her Or more Honestly I dont\nknow...\n\nWell I got there.",
    "There was no sound in the house.",
    "The door was\nunlocked.",
    "I went in.",
    "You know how I found her.",
    "Sitting there dead\nher face all purple and swollen.",
    "All the things Id been thinking\nseemed silly and melodramatic.",
    "I knew that Id never really want\n\n\fto kill anyone when it came to it.",
    "But I did realise that it might be\nawkward to explain what Id been doing in the house.",
    "It was a cold\nnight and Id got gloves on so I knew I hadnt left any fingerprints\nand I didnt think for a moment anyone had seen me.",
    "Thats all.",
    "She paused and added abruptly What are you going to do about\nit\n\nNothing said Hercule Poirot.",
    "I wish you good luck in life that is\nall.",
    "Epilogue\n\nHercule Poirot and Superintendent Spence were celebrating at the\nLa Vielle Grandm\u00e8re.",
    "As coffee was served Spence leaned back in his chair and gave a\ndeep sigh of repletion.",
    "Not at all bad grub here he said approvingly.",
    "A bit frenchified\nperhaps but after all where can you get a decent steak and chips\nnowadays\n\nI had been dining here on the evening you first came to me said\nPoirot reminiscently.",
    "Ah a lot of water under the bridge since then.",
    "Ive got to hand it to\nyou M. Poirot.",
    "You did the trick all right.",
    "A slight smile creased\nhis wooden countenance.",
    "Lucky that young man didnt realise\n\n\fhow very little evidence wed really got.",
    "Why a clever counsel\nwould have made mincemeat of it But he lost his head completely\nand gave the show away.",
    "Spilt the beans and incriminated himself\nup to the hilt.",
    "Lucky for us\n\nIt was not entirely luck said Poirot reprovingly.",
    "I played him as\nyou play the big fish He thinks I take the evidence against Mrs\nSummerhayes seriously  when it is not so he suffers the reaction\nand goes to pieces.",
    "And besides he is a coward.",
    "I whirl the sugar\nhammer and he thinks I mean to hit him.",
    "Acute fear alway\nproduces the truth.",
    "Lucky you didnt suffer from Major Summerhayes reaction said\nSpence with a grin.",
    "Got a temper he has and quick on his feet.",
    "I\nonly got between you just in time.",
    "Has he forgiven you yet\n\nOh yes we are the firmest friends.",
    "And I have given Mrs\nSummerhayes a cookery book and have also taught her personally\nhow to make an omelette.",
    "Bon Dieu what I suffered in that house\n\nHe closed his eyes.",
    "Complicated business the whole thing ruminated Spence\nuninterested in Poirots agonised memories.",
    "Just shows how true\nthe old saying is that everyones got something to hide.",
    "Mrs\nCarpenter now had a narrow squeak of being arrested for\nmurder.",
    "If ever a woman acted guilty she did and all for what\n\nEh bien what asked Poirot curiously.",
    "Just the usual business of a rather unsavoury past.",
    "She had been\na taxi dancer  and a bright girl with plenty of men friends She\nwasnt a war widow when she came and settled down in\nBroadhinny.",
    "Only what they call nowadays an unofficial wife.",
    "Well\nof course all that wouldnt do for a stuffed shirt like Guy Carpenter\nso shed spun him a very different sort of tale.",
    "And she was frantic\nlest the whole thing would come out once we started poking round\ninto peoples origins.",
    "He sipped his coffee and then gave a low chuckle.",
    "Then take the Wetherbys.",
    "Sinister sort of house.",
    "Hate and malice.",
    "Awkward frustrated sort of girl.",
    "And whats behind that Nothing\nsinister.",
    "Just money Plain pounds shillings and pence.",
    "As simple as that\n\nThe girl has the money  quite a lot of it.",
    "Left her by an aunt.",
    "So\nmother keeps tight hold of her in case she should want to marry.",
    "And stepfather loathes her because she has the dibs and pays the\nbills.",
    "I gather he himself has been a failure at anything hes tried.",
    "A\nmean cuss  and as for Mrs W. shes pure poison dissolved in\nsugar.",
    "I agree with you.",
    "Poirot nodded his head in a satisfied fashion.",
    "It\nis fortunate that the girl has money.",
    "It makes her marriage to\nJames Bentley much more easy to arrange.",
    "Superintendent Spence looked surprised.",
    "Going to marry James Bentley Deirdre Henderson Who says\nso\n\nI say so said Poirot.",
    "I occupy myself with the affair.",
    "I have now\nthat our little problem is over too much time on my hands.",
    "I shall\nemploy myself in forwarding this marriage.",
    "As yet the two\nconcerned have no idea of such a thing.",
    "But they are attracted.",
    "Left to themselves nothing would happen  but they have to\nreckon with Hercule Poirot.",
    "You will see The affair will march.",
    "Spence grinned.",
    "Dont mind sticking your fingers in other peoples pie do you\n\nMon cher that does not come well from you said Poirot\nreproachfully.",
    "Ah youve got me there.",
    "All the same James Bentley is a poor\nstick.",
    "Certainly he is a poor stick At the moment he is positively\naggrieved because he is not going to be hanged.",
    "He ought to be down on his knees with gratitude to you said\nSpence.",
    "Say rather to you.",
    "But apparently he does not think so.",
    "Queer cuss.",
    "As you say and yet at least two women have been prepared to\ntake an interest in him.",
    "Nature is very unexpected.",
    "I thought it was Maude Williams you were going to pair off with\nhim.",
    "He shall make his choice aid Poirot.",
    "He shall  how do you say\nit  award the apple.",
    "But I think that it is Deirdre Henderson that\nhe will choose.",
    "Maude Williams has too much energy and vitality.",
    "With her he would retire even farther into his shell.",
    "Cant think why either of them should want him\n\nThe ways of Nature are indeed inscrutable.",
    "All the same youll have your work cut out.",
    "First bringing him up\nto the scratch  and then prising the girl loose from poison puss\nmother  shell fight you tooth and claw\n\nSuccess is on the side of the big battalions.",
    "On the side of the big moustaches I suppose you mean.",
    "Spence roared.",
    "Poirot stroked his moustache complacently and\nsuggested a brandy.",
    "I dont mind if I do M. Poirot.",
    "Poirot gave the order.",
    "Ah said Spence I knew there was something else I had to tell\nyou.",
    "You remember the Rendell\n\nNaturally.",
    "Well when we were checking up on him something rather odd\ncame to light.",
    "It seems that when his first wife died in Leeds where\nhis practice was at that time the Police there got some rather\nnasty anonymous letters about him.",
    "Saying in effect that hed\npoisoned her.",
    "Of course people do say that sort of thing.",
