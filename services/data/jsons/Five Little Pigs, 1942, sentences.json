    "\f\fAgatha Christie\n\nFive Little Pigs\nA Hercule Poirot Mystery\n\n\f\fTo Stephen Glanville\n\n\fIntroduction\nCARLA LEMARCHANT\n\nHercule Poirot looked with interest and appreciation at the young\nwoman who was being ushered into the room.",
    "There had been nothing distinctive in the letter she had written.",
    "It had\nbeen a mere request for an appointment with no hint of what lay behind\nthat request.",
    "It had been brief and businesslike.",
    "Only the firmness of the\nhandwriting had indicated that Carla Lemarchant was a young woman.",
    "And now here she was in the flesh\u2014a tall slender young woman in\nthe early twenties.",
    "The kind of young woman that one definitely looked\nat twice.",
    "Her clothes were good an expensive wellcut coat and skirt and\nluxurious furs.",
    "Her head was well poised on her shoulders she had a\nsquare brow a sensitively cut nose and a determined chin.",
    "She looked\nvery much alive.",
    "It was her aliveness more than her beauty which struck\nthe predominant note.",
    "Before her entrance Hercule Poirot had been feeling old\u2014now he\nfelt rejuvenated\u2014alive\u2014keen\nAs he came forward to greet her he was aware of her dark grey eyes\nstudying him attentively.",
    "She was very earnest in that scrutiny.",
    "She sat down and accepted the cigarette that he offered her.",
    "After it\nwas lit she sat for a minute or two smoking still looking at him with that\nearnest thoughtful gaze.",
    "Poirot said gently\n\u201cYes it has to be decided does it not\u201d\nShe started.",
    "\u201cI beg your pardon\u201d\nHer voice was attractive with a faint agreeable huskiness in it.",
    "\u201cYou are making up your mind are you not whether I am a mere\nmountebank or the man you need\u201d\nShe smiled.",
    "She said\n\u201cWell yes\u2014something of that kind.",
    "You see Mr. Poirot you\u2014you\ndon\u2019t look exactly the way I pictured you.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I am old am I not Older than you imagined\u201d\n\u201cYes that too.\u201d She hesitated.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m being frank you see.",
    "I want\u2014I\u2019ve\ngot to have\u2014the best.\u201d\n\u201cRest assured\u201d said Hercule Poirot.",
    "\u201cI am the best\u201d\n\n\fCarla said \u201cYou\u2019re not modest\u2026All the same I\u2019m inclined to take\nyou at your word.\u201d\nPoirot said placidly\n\u201cOne does not you know employ merely the muscles.",
    "I do not need\nto bend and measure the footprints and pick up the cigarette ends and\nexamine the bent blades of grass.",
    "It is enough for me to sit back in my\nchair and think.",
    "It is this\u201d\u2014he tapped his eggshaped head\u2014\u201cthis that\nfunctions\u201d\n\u201cI know\u201d said Carla Lemarchant.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019ve come to you.",
    "I\nwant you you see to do something fantastic\u201d\n\u201cThat\u201d said Hercule Poirot \u201cpromises well\u201d\nHe looked at her in encouragement.",
    "Carla Lemarchant drew a deep breath.",
    "\u201cMy name\u201d she said \u201cisn\u2019t Carla.",
    "It\u2019s Caroline.",
    "The same as my\nmother\u2019s.",
    "I was called after her.\u201d She paused.",
    "\u201cAnd though I\u2019ve always\ngone by the name of Lemarchant\u2014my real name is Crale.\u201d\nHercule Poirot\u2019s forehead creased a moment perplexedly.",
    "He\nmurmured \u201cCrale\u2014I seem to remember\u2026.\u201d\nShe said\n\u201cMy father was a painter\u2014rather a wellknown painter.",
    "Some people\nsay he was a great painter.",
    "I think he was.\u201d\nHercule Poirot said \u201cAmyas Crale\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d She paused then she went on \u201cAnd my mother Caroline\nCrale was tried for murdering him\u201d\n\u201cAha\u201d said Hercule Poirot.",
    "\u201cI remember now\u2014but only vaguely.",
    "I\nwas abroad at the time.",
    "It was a long time ago.\u201d\n\u201cSixteen years\u201d said the girl.",
    "Her face was very white now and her eyes two burning lights.",
    "She said\n\u201cDo you understand She was tried and convicted\u2026She wasn\u2019t\nhanged because they felt that there were extenuating circumstances\u2014so\nthe sentence was commuted to penal servitude for life.",
    "But she died only\na year after the trial.",
    "You see It\u2019s all over\u2014done\u2014finished with\u2026.\u201d\nPoirot said quietly \u201cAnd so\u201d\nThe girl called Carla Lemarchant pressed her hands together.",
    "She\nspoke slowly and haltingly but with an odd pointed emphasis.",
    "She said\n\n\f\u201cYou\u2019ve got to understand\u2014exactly\u2014where I come in.",
    "I was five\nyears old at the time it\u2014happened.",
    "Too young to know anything about it.",
    "I remember my mother and my father of course and I remember leaving\nhome suddenly\u2014being taken to the country.",
    "I remember the pigs and a\nnice fat farmer\u2019s wife\u2014and everybody being very kind\u2014and I\nremember quite clearly the funny way they used to look at me\u2014\neverybody\u2014a sort of furtive look.",
    "I knew of course children do that\nthere was something wrong\u2014but I didn\u2019t know what.",
    "\u201cAnd then I went on a ship\u2014it was exciting\u2014it went on for days and\nthen I was in Canada and Uncle Simon met me and I lived in Montreal\nwith him and with Aunt Louise and when I asked about Mummy and\nDaddy they said they\u2019d be coming soon.",
    "And then\u2014and then I think I\nforgot\u2014only I sort of knew that they were dead without remembering\nanyone actually telling me so.",
    "Because by that time you see I didn\u2019t\nthink about them any more.",
    "I was very happy you know.",
    "Uncle Simon\nand Aunt Louise were sweet to me and I went to school and had a lot of\nfriends and I\u2019d quite forgotten that I\u2019d ever had another name not\nLemarchant.",
    "Aunt Louise you see told me that that was my name in\nCanada and that seemed quite sensible to me at the time\u2014it was just my\nCanadian name\u2014but as I say I forgot in the end that I\u2019d ever had any\nother.\u201d\nShe flung up her defiant chin.",
    "She said\n\u201cLook at me.",
    "You\u2019d say\u2014wouldn\u2019t you if you met me \u2018There goes\na girl who\u2019s got nothing to worry about\u2019 I\u2019m well off I\u2019ve got splendid\nhealth I\u2019m sufficiently good to look at I can enjoy life.",
    "At twenty there\nwasn\u2019t a girl anywhere I\u2019d have changed places with.",
    "\u201cBut already you know I\u2019d begun to ask questions.",
    "About my own\nmother and father.",
    "Who they were and what they did I\u2019d have been\nbound to find out in the end\u2014\n\u201cAs it was they told me the truth.",
    "When I was twentyone.",
    "They had\nto then because for one thing I came into my own money.",
    "And then you\nsee there was the letter.",
    "The letter my mother left for me when she\ndied.\u201d\nHer expression changed dimmed.",
    "Her eyes were no longer two\nburning points they were dark dim pools.",
    "She said\n\u201cThat\u2019s when I learnt the truth.",
    "That my mother had been convicted of\nmurder.",
    "It was\u2014rather horrible.\u201d\nShe paused.",
    "\u201cThere\u2019s something else I must tell you.",
    "I was engaged to be married.",
    "They said we must wait\u2014that we couldn\u2019t be married until I was twentyone.",
    "When I knew I understood why.\u201d\nPoirot stirred and spoke for the first time.",
    "He said\n\u201cAnd what was your fianc\u00e9\u2019s reaction\u201d\n\u201cJohn John didn\u2019t care.",
    "He said it made no difference\u2014not to him.",
    "He and I were John and Carla\u2014and the past didn\u2019t matter.\u201d\nShe leaned forward.",
    "\u201cWe\u2019re still engaged.",
    "But all the same you know it does matter.",
    "It\nmatters to me.",
    "And it matters to John too\u2026It isn\u2019t the past that matters to\nus\u2014it\u2019s the future.\u201d She clenched her hands.",
    "\u201cWe want children you see.",
    "We both want children.",
    "And we don\u2019t want to watch our children\ngrowing up and be afraid.\u201d\nPoirot said\n\u201cDo you not realize that amongst every one\u2019s ancestors there has been\nviolence and evil\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t understand.",
    "That\u2019s so of course.",
    "But then one doesn\u2019t\nusually know about it.",
    "We do.",
    "It\u2019s very near to us.",
    "And sometimes\u2014I\u2019ve\nseen John just look at me.",
    "Such a quick glance\u2014just a flash.",
    "Supposing\nwe were married and we\u2019d quarrelled\u2014and I saw him look at me and\u2014\nand wonder\u201d\nHercule Poirot said \u201cHow was your father killed\u201d\nCarla\u2019s voice came clear and firm.",
    "\u201cHe was poisoned.\u201d\nHercule Poirot said \u201cI see.\u201d\nThere was a silence.",
    "Then the girl said in a calm matteroffact voice\n\u201cThank goodness you\u2019re sensible.",
    "You see that it does matter\u2014and\nwhat it involves.",
    "You don\u2019t try and patch it up and trot out consoling\nphrases.\u201d\n\u201cI understand very well\u201d said Poirot.",
    "\u201cWhat I do not understand is\nwhat you want of me\u201d\nCarla Lemarchant said simply\n\u201cI want to marry John And I mean to marry John And I want to\nhave at least two girls and two boys.",
    "And you\u2019re going to make that\npossible\u201d\n\u201cYou mean\u2014you want me to talk to your fianc\u00e9 Ah no it is idiocy\nwhat I say there It is something quite different that you are suggesting.",
    "Tell me what is in your mind.\u201d\n\u201cListen Mr. Poirot.",
    "Get this\u2014and get it clearly.",
    "I\u2019m hiring you to\ninvestigate a case of murder.\u201d\n\u201cDo you mean\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYes I do mean.",
    "A case of murder is a case of murder whether it\nhappened yesterday or sixteen years ago.\u201d\n\u201cBut my dear young lady\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWait Mr. Poirot.",
    "You haven\u2019t got it all yet.",
    "There\u2019s a very important\npoint.\u201d\n\u201cYes\u201d\n\u201cMy mother was innocent\u201d said Carla Lemarchant.",
    "Hercule Poirot rubbed his nose.",
    "He murmured\n\u201cWell naturally\u2014I comprehend that\u2014\u201d\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t sentiment.",
    "There\u2019s her letter.",
    "She left it for me before she\ndied.",
    "It was to be given to me when I was twentyone.",
    "She left it for that\none reason\u2014that I should be quite sure.",
    "That\u2019s all that was in it.",
    "That she\nhadn\u2019t done it\u2014that she was innocent\u2014that I could be sure of that\nalways.\u201d\nHercule Poirot looked thoughtfully at the young vital face staring so\nearnestly at him.",
    "He said slowly\n\u201cTout de m\u00eame\u2014\u201d\nCarla smiled.",
    "\u201cNo mother wasn\u2019t like that You\u2019re thinking that it might be a lie\u2014a\nsentimental lie\u201d She leaned forward earnestly.",
    "\u201cListen Mr. Poirot there\nare some things that children know quite well.",
    "I can remember my\nmother\u2014a patchy remembrance of course but I remember quite well\nthe sort of person she was.",
    "She didn\u2019t tell lies\u2014kind lies.",
    "If a thing was\ngoing to hurt she always told you so.",
    "Dentists or thorns in your finger\u2014\nall that sort of thing.",
    "Truth was a\u2014a natural impulse to her.",
    "I wasn\u2019t I\ndon\u2019t think especially fond of her\u2014but I trusted her.",
    "I still trust her If\nshe says she didn\u2019t kill my father then she didn\u2019t kill him She wasn\u2019t the\nsort of person who would solemnly write down a lie when she knew she\nwas dying.\u201d\nSlowly almost reluctantly Hercule Poirot bowed his head.",
    "Carla went on.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s all right for me marrying John.",
    "I know it\u2019s all right.",
    "But he doesn\u2019t.",
    "He feels that naturally I would think my mother was\n\n\finnocent.",
    "It\u2019s got to be cleared up Mr. Poirot.",
    "And you\u2019re going to do\nit\u201d\nHercule Poirot said slowly\n\u201cGranted that what you say is true mademoiselle sixteen years have\ngone by\u201d\nCarla Lemarchant said \u201cOh of course it\u2019s going to be difficult\nNobody but you could do it\u201d\nHercule Poirot\u2019s eyes twinkled slightly.",
    "He said\n\u201cYou give me the best butter\u2014hein\u201d\nCarla said\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard about you.",
    "The things you\u2019ve done.",
    "The way you have\ndone them.",
    "It\u2019s psychology that interests you isn\u2019t it Well that doesn\u2019t\nchange with time.",
    "The tangible things are gone\u2014the cigarette end and\nthe footprints and the bent blades of grass.",
    "You can\u2019t look for those any\nmore.",
    "But you can go over all the facts of the case and perhaps talk to\nthe people who were there at the time\u2014they\u2019re all alive still\u2014and then\n\u2014and then as you said just now you can lie back in your chair and\nthink.",
    "And you\u2019ll know what really happened\u2026.\u201d\nHercule Poirot rose to his feet.",
    "One hand caressed his moustache.",
    "He\nsaid\n\u201cMademoiselle I am honoured I will justify your faith in me.",
    "I will\ninvestigate your case of murder.",
    "I will search back into the events of\nsixteen years ago and I will find out the truth.\u201d\nCarla got up.",
    "Her eyes were shining.",
    "But she only said\n\u201cGood.\u201d\nHercule Poirot shook an eloquent forefinger.",
    "\u201cOne little moment.",
    "I have said I will find out the truth.",
    "I do not you\nunderstand have the bias.",
    "I do not accept your assurance of your\nmother\u2019s innocence.",
    "If she was guilty\u2014eh bien what then\u201d\nCarla\u2019s proud head went back.",
    "She said\n\u201cI\u2019m her daughter.",
    "I want the truth\u201d\nHercule Poirot said\n\u201cEn avant then.",
    "Though it is not that that I should say.",
    "On the\ncontrary.",
    "En arri\u00e8re\u2026.\u201d\n\n\f\fBOOK ONE\n\n\f\fOne\nCOUNSEL FOR THE DEFENCE\n\n\u201cDo I remember the Crale case\u201d asked Sir Montague Depleach.",
    "\u201cCertainly I do.",
    "Remember it very well.",
    "Most attractive woman.",
    "But\nunbalanced of course.",
    "No selfcontrol.\u201d\nHe glanced sideways at Poirot.",
    "\u201cWhat makes you ask me about it\u201d\n\u201cI am interested.\u201d\n\u201cNot really tactful of you my dear man\u201d said Depleach showing his\nteeth in his sudden famous \u201cwolf\u2019s smile\u201d which had been reputed to\nhave such a terrifying effect upon witnesses.",
    "\u201cNot one of my successes\nyou know.",
    "I didn\u2019t get her off.\u201d\n\u201cI know that.\u201d\nSir Montague shrugged his shoulders.",
    "He said\n\u201cOf course I hadn\u2019t quite as much experience then as I have now.",
    "All\nthe same I think I did all that could humanly be done.",
    "One can\u2019t do much\nwithout cooperation.",
    "We did get it commuted to penal servitude.",
    "Provocation you know.",
    "Lots of respectable wives and mothers got up a\npetition.",
    "There was a lot of sympathy for her.\u201d\nHe leaned back stretching out his long legs.",
    "His face took on a\njudicial appraising look.",
    "\u201cIf she\u2019d shot him you know or even knifed him\u2014I\u2019d have gone all\nout for manslaughter.",
    "But poison\u2014no you can\u2019t play tricks with that.",
    "It\u2019s\ntricky\u2014very tricky.\u201d\n\u201cWhat was the defence\u201d asked Hercule Poirot.",
    "He knew because he had already read the newspaper files but he saw\nno harm in playing the complete ignorant to Sir Montague.",
    "\u201cOh suicide.",
    "Only thing you could go for.",
    "But it didn\u2019t go down well.",
    "Crale simply wasn\u2019t that kind of man You never met him I suppose\nNo Well he was a great blustering vivid sort of chap.",
    "Great womanizer\nbeer drinker\u2014all the rest of it.",
    "Went in for the lusts of the flesh and\nenjoyed them.",
    "You can\u2019t persuade a jury that a man like that is going to\nsit down and quietly do away with himself.",
    "It just doesn\u2019t fit.",
    "No I was\nafraid I was up against a losing proposition from the first.",
    "And she\nwouldn\u2019t play up I knew we\u2019d lost as soon as she went into the box.",
    "No\n\n\ffight in her at all.",
    "But there it is\u2014if you don\u2019t put your client into the\nbox the jury draw their own conclusions.\u201d\nPoirot said\n\u201cIs that what you meant when you said just now that one cannot do\nmuch without cooperation\u201d\n\u201cAbsolutely my dear fellow.",
    "We\u2019re not magicians you know.",
    "Half\nthe battle is the impression the accused makes on the jury.",
    "I\u2019ve known\njuries time and again bring in verdicts dead against the judge\u2019s summing\nup.",
    "\u2018\u2019E did it all right\u2019\u2014that\u2019s the point of view.",
    "Or \u2018He never did a\nthing like that\u2014don\u2019t tell me\u2019 Caroline Crale didn\u2019t even try to put up a\nfight.\u201d\n\u201cWhy was that\u201d\nSir Montague shrugged his shoulders.",
    "\u201cDon\u2019t ask me.",
    "Of course she was fond of the fellow.",
    "Broke her all\nup when she came to and realized what she\u2019d done.",
    "Don\u2019t believe she\never rallied from the shock.\u201d\n\u201cSo in your opinion she was guilty\u201d\nDepleach looked rather startled.",
    "He said\n\u201cEr\u2014well I thought we were taking that for granted.\u201d\n\u201cDid she ever admit to you that she was guilty\u201d\nDepleach looked shocked.",
    "\u201cOf course not\u2014of course not.",
    "We have our code you know.",
    "Innocence is always\u2014er\u2014assumed.",
    "If you\u2019re so interested it\u2019s a pity you\ncan\u2019t get hold of old Mayhew.",
    "Mayhews were the solicitors who briefed\nme.",
    "Old Mayhew could have told you more than I can.",
    "But there\u2014he\u2019s\njoined the great majority.",
    "There\u2019s young George Mayhew of course but\nhe was only a boy at the time.",
    "It\u2019s a long time ago you know.\u201d\n\u201cYes I know.",
    "It is fortunate for me that you remember so much.",
    "You\nhave a remarkable memory.\u201d\nDepleach looked pleased.",
    "He murmured\n\u201cOh well one remembers the main headings you know.",
    "Especially\nwhen it\u2019s a capital charge.",
    "And of course the Crale case got a lot of\npublicity from the press.",
    "Lot of sex interest and all that.",
    "The girl in the\ncase was pretty striking.",
    "Hardboiled piece of goods I thought.\u201d\n\u201cYou will forgive me if I seem too insistent\u201d said Poirot \u201cbut I repeat\nonce more you had no doubt of Caroline Crale\u2019s guilt\u201d\nDepleach shrugged his shoulders.",
    "He said\n\n\f\u201cFrankly\u2014as man to man\u2014I don\u2019t think there\u2019s much doubt about it.",
    "Oh yes she did it all right.\u201d\n\u201cWhat was the evidence against her\u201d\n\u201cVery damning indeed.",
    "First of all there was motive.",
    "She and Crale\nhad led a kind of cat and dog life for years\u2014interminable rows.",
    "He was\nalways getting mixed up with some woman or other.",
    "Couldn\u2019t help it.",
    "He\nwas that kind of man.",
    "She stood it pretty well on the whole.",
    "Made\nallowances for him on the score of temperament\u2014and the man really\nwas a firstclass painter you know.",
    "His stuff\u2019s gone up enormously in\nprice\u2014enormously.",
    "Don\u2019t care for that style of painting myself\u2014ugly\nforceful stuff but it\u2019s good\u2014no doubt of that.",
    "\u201cWell as I say there had been trouble about women from time to\ntime.",
    "Mrs. Crale wasn\u2019t the meek kind who suffers in silence.",
    "There were\nrows all right.",
    "But he always came back to her in the end.",
    "These affairs\nof his blew over.",
    "But this final affair was rather different.",
    "It was a girl\nyou see\u2014and quite a young girl.",
    "She was only twenty.",
    "\u201cElsa Greer that was her name.",
    "She was the only daughter of some\nYorkshire manufacturer.",
    "She\u2019d got money and determination and she\nknew what she wanted.",
    "What she wanted was Amyas Crale.",

    "But\u2014you\u2019ll excuse me Mr. Poirot\u2014you\u2019re\nan ingenious man.",
    "You could cook her up a tale.\u201d\nPoirot replied\n\u201cYou do not know the young lady.\u201d\n\u201cOh come now\u2014a man of your experience\u201d\nPoirot drew himself up.",
    "\u201cI may be mon cher an artistic and competent liar\u2014you seem to\nthink so.",
    "But it is not my idea of ethical conduct.",
    "I have my standards.\u201d\n\u201cSorry Mr. Poirot.",
    "I didn\u2019t mean to hurt your feelings.",
    "But it would\nbe all in a good cause so to speak.\u201d\n\u201cOh I wonder would it really\u201d\nHale said slowly\n\u201cIt\u2019s tough luck on a happy innocent girl who\u2019s just going to get\nmarried to find that her mother was a murderess.",
    "If I were you I\u2019d go to\nher and say that after all suicide was what it was.",
    "Say the case was\nmishandled by Depleach.",
    "Say that there\u2019s no doubt in your mind that\nCrale poisoned himself\u201d\n\n\f\u201cBut there is every doubt in my mind I do not believe for one minute\nthat Crale poisoned himself.",
    "Do you consider it even reasonably possible\nyourself\u201d\nSlowly Hale shook his head.",
    "\u201cYou see No it is the truth I must have\u2014not a plausible\u2014or not\nvery plausible\u2014lie.\u201d\nHale turned and looked at Poirot.",
    "His square rather red face grew a\nlittle redder and even appeared to get a little squarer.",
    "He said\n\u201cYou talk about the truth.",
    "I\u2019d like to make it plain to you that we\nthink we got the truth in the Crale case.\u201d\nPoirot said quickly\n\u201cThat pronouncement from you means a great deal.",
    "I know you for\nwhat you are an honest and capable man.",
    "Now tell me this was there no\ndoubt at any time in your mind as to the guilt of Mrs. Crale\u201d\nThe Superintendent\u2019s answer came promptly.",
    "\u201cNo doubt at all Mr. Poirot.",
    "The circumstances pointed to her straight\naway and every single fact that we uncovered supported that view.\u201d\n\u201cYou can give me an outline of the evidence against her\u201d\n\u201cI can.",
    "When I received your letter I looked up the case.\u201d He picked\nup a small notebook.",
    "\u201cI\u2019ve jotted down all the salient facts here.\u201d\n\u201cThank you my friend.",
    "I am all eagerness to hear.\u201d\nHale cleared his throat.",
    "A slight official intonation made itself heard\nin his voice.",
    "He said\n\u201cAt two fortyfive on the afternoon of September 18th Inspector\nConway was rung up by Dr. Andrew Faussett.",
    "Dr. Faussett stated that\nMr. Amyas Crale of Alderbury had died suddenly and that in\nconsequence of the circumstances of that death and also of a statement\nmade to him by a Mr. Blake a guest staying in the house he considered\nthat it was a case for the police.",
    "\u201cInspector Conway in company with a sergeant and the police\nsurgeon came over to Alderbury straight away.",
    "Dr. Faussett was there\nand took him to where the body of Mr. Crale had not been disturbed.",
    "\u201cMr.",
    "Crale had been painting in a small enclosed garden known as\nthe Battery garden from the fact that it overlooked the sea and had some\nminiature cannon placed in embattlements.",
    "It was situated at about four\nminutes\u2019 walk from the house.",
    "Mr. Crale had not come up to the house\nfor lunch as he wanted to get certain effects of light on the stone\u2014and\n\n\fthe sun would have been wrong for this later.",
    "He had therefore\nremained alone in the Battery garden painting.",
    "This was stated not to be\nan unusual occurrence.",
    "Mr. Crale took very little notice of meal times.",
    "Sometimes a sandwich would be sent down to him but more often he\npreferred to remain undisturbed.",
    "The last people to see him alive were\nMiss Elsa Greer staying in the house and Mr. Meredith Blake a near\nneighbour.",
    "These two went up together to the house and went with the\nrest of the household in to lunch.",
    "After lunch coffee was served on the\nterrace.",
    "Mrs. Crale finished drinking her coffee and then observed that\nshe would \u2018go down and see how Amyas was getting on.\u2019 Miss Cecilia\nWilliams governess got up and accompanied her.",
    "She was looking for a\npullover belonging to her pupil Miss Angela Warren sister of Mrs.\nCrale which the latter had mislaid and she thought it possible it might\nhave been left down on the beach.",
    "\u201cThese two started off together.",
    "The path led downwards through\nsome woods until it emerged at the door leading into the Battery garden.",
    "You could either go into the Battery garden or you could continue on the\nsame path which led down to the seashore.",
    "\u201cMiss Williams continued on down and Mrs. Crale went into the\nBattery garden.",
    "Almost at once however Mrs. Crale screamed and Miss\nWilliams hurried back.",
    "Mr. Crale was reclining on a seat and he was\ndead.",
    "\u201cAt Mrs. Crale\u2019s urgent request Miss Williams left the Battery garden\nand hurried up to the house to telephone for a doctor.",
    "On her way\nhowever she met Mr. Meredith Blake and entrusted her errand to him\nherself returning to Mrs. Crale whom she felt might be in need of\nsomeone.",
    "Dr. Faussett arrived on the scene a quarter of an hour later.",
    "He\nsaw at once that Mr. Crale had been dead for some time\u2014he placed the\nprobable time of death at between one and two o\u2019clock.",
    "There was\nnothing to show what had caused death.",
    "There was no sign of any wound\nand Mr. Crale\u2019s attitude was a perfectly natural one.",
    "Nevertheless Dr.\nFaussett who was well acquainted with Mr. Crale\u2019s state of health and\nwho knew positively that there was no disease or weakness of any kind\nwas inclined to take a grave view of the situation.",
    "It was at this point that\nMr. Philip Blake made a certain statement to Dr. Faussett.\u201d\nSuperintendent Hale paused drew a deep breath and passed as it\nwere to Chapter Two.",
    "\u201cSubsequently Mr. Blake repeated this statement to Inspector\nConway.",
    "It was to this effect.",
    "He had that morning received a telephone\nmessage from his brother Mr. Meredith Blake who lived at Handcross\nManor a mile and a half away.",
    "Mr. Meredith Blake was an amateur\nchemist\u2014or perhaps herbalist would describe it best.",
    "On entering his\nlaboratory that morning Mr. Meredith Blake had been startled to note\nthat a bottle containing a preparation of hemlock which had been quite\nfull the day before was now nearly empty.",
    "Worried and alarmed by this\nfact he had rung up his brother to ask his advice as to what he should do\nabout it.",
    "Mr. Philip Blake had urged his brother to come over to\nAlderbury at once and they would talk the matter over.",
    "He himself\nwalked part way to meet his brother and they had come up to the house\ntogether.",
    "They had come to no decision as to what course to adopt and\nhad left the matter in order to consult again after lunch.",
    "\u201cAs a result of further inquiries Inspector Conway ascertained the\nfollowing facts On the preceding afternoon five people had walked over\nfrom Alderbury to tea at Handcross Manor.",
    "There were Mr. and Mrs.\nCrale Miss Angela Warren Miss Elsa Greer and Mr. Philip Blake.",
    "During the time spent there Mr. Meredith Blake had given quite a\ndissertation on his hobby and had taken the party into his little laboratory\nand \u2018shown them round.\u2019 In the course of this tour he had mentioned\ncertain specific drugs\u2014one of which was coniine the active principle of\nthe spotted hemlock.",
    "He had explained its properties had lamented the\nfact that it had now disappeared from the Pharmacop\u0153ia and boasted that\nhe had known small doses of it to be very efficacious in whooping cough\nand asthma.",
    "Later he had mentioned its lethal properties and had actually\nread to his guests some passage from a Greek author describing its\neffects.\u201d\nSuperintendent Hale paused refilled his pipe and passed on to\nChapter Three.",
    "\u201cColonel Frere the Chief Constable put the case into my hands.",
    "The\nresult of the autopsy put the matter beyond any doubt.",
    "Coniine I\nunderstand leaves no definite postmortem appearances but the doctors\nknew what to look for and an ample amount of the drug was recovered.",
    "The doctor was of the opinion that it had been administered two or three\nhours before death.",
    "In front of Mr. Crale on the table there had been an\nempty glass and an empty beer bottle.",
    "The dregs of both were analysed.",
    "There was no coniine in the bottle but there was in the glass.",
    "I made\n\n\finquiries and learned that although a case of beer and glasses were kept\nin a small summerhouse in the Battery garden in case Mr. Crale should\nfeel thirsty when painting on this particular morning Mrs. Crale had\nbrought down from the house a bottle of freshly iced beer.",
    "Mr. Crale was\nbusy painting when she arrived and Miss Greer was posing for him\nsitting on one of the battlements.",
    "\u201cMrs.",
    "Crale opened the beer poured it out and put the glass into her\nhusband\u2019s hand as he was standing before the easel.",
    "He tossed it off in\none draught\u2014a habit of his I learned.",
    "Then he made a grimace set down\nthe glass on the table and said \u2018Everything tastes foul to me today\u2019\nMiss Greer upon that laughed and said \u2018Liver\u2019 Mr. Crale said \u2018Well at\nany rate it was cold.\u2019\u201d\nHale paused.",
    "Poirot said\n\u201cAt what time did this take place\u201d\n\u201cAt about a quarter past eleven.",
    "Mr. Crale continued to paint.",
    "According to Miss Greer he later complained of stiffness in the limbs\nand grumbled that he must have got a touch of rheumatism.",
    "But he was\nthe type of man who hates to admit to illness of any kind and he\nundoubtedly tried not to admit that he was feeling ill. His irritable\ndemand that he should be left alone and the others go up to lunch was\nquite characteristic of the man I should say.\u201d\nPoirot nodded.",
    "Hale continued.",
    "\u201cSo Crale was left alone in the Battery garden.",
    "No doubt he dropped\ndown on the seat and relaxed as soon as he was alone.",
    "Muscular\nparalysis would then set in.",
    "No help was at hand and death supervened.\u201d\nAgain Poirot nodded.",
    "Hale said\n\u201cWell I proceeded according to routine.",
    "There wasn\u2019t much difficulty\nin getting down to the facts.",
    "On the preceding day there had been a setto\nbetween Mrs. Crale and Miss Greer.",
    "The latter had pretty insolently\ndescribed some change in the arrangement of the furniture \u2018when I am\nliving here.\u2019 Mrs. Crale took her up and said \u2018What do you mean\nWhen you are living here.\u2019 Miss Greer replied \u2018Don\u2019t pretend you don\u2019t\nknow what I mean Caroline.",
    "You\u2019re just like an ostrich that buries its\nhead in the sand.",
    "You know perfectly well that Amyas and I care for each\nother and are going to be married.\u2019 Mrs. Crale said \u2018I know nothing of\nthe kind.\u2019 Miss Greer then said \u2018Well you know it now.\u2019 Whereupon it\n\n\fseems Mrs. Crale turned to her husband who had just come into the\nroom and said \u2018Is it true Amyas that you are going to marry Elsa\u2019\u201d\nPoirot said with interest\n\u201cAnd what did Mr. Crale say to that\u201d\n\u201cApparently he turned on Miss Greer and shouted at her \u2018What the\ndevil do you mean by blurting that out Haven\u2019t you got the sense to\nhold your tongue\u2019\n\u201cMiss Greer said \u2018I think Caroline ought to recognize the truth.\u2019\n\u201cMrs.",
    "Crale said to her husband \u2018Is it true Amyas\u2019\n\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t look at her it seems turned his face away and\nmumbled something.",
    "\u201cShe said \u2018Speak out.",
    "I\u2019ve got to know.\u2019 Whereupon he said\n\u201c\u2018Oh it\u2019s true enough\u2014but I don\u2019t want to discuss it now.\u2019\n\u201cThen he flounced out of the room again and Miss Greer said\n\u201c\u2018You see\u2019 and went on\u2014with something about its being no good for\nMrs. Crale to adopt a doginthemanger attitude about it.",
    "They must all\nbehave like rational people.",
    "She herself hoped that Caroline and Amyas\nwould always remain good friends.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what did Mrs. Crale say to that\u201d asked Poirot curiously.",
    "\u201cAccording to the witnesses she laughed.",
    "She said \u2018Over my dead\nbody Elsa.\u2019 She went to the door and Miss Greer called after her \u2018What\ndo you mean\u2019 Mrs. Crale looked back and said \u2018I\u2019ll kill Amyas before I\ngive him up to you.\u2019\u201d\nHale paused.",
    "\u201cPretty damning\u2014eh\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d Poirot seemed thoughtful.",
    "\u201cWho overheard this scene\u201d\n\u201cMiss Williams was in the room and Philip Blake.",
    "Very awkward for\nthem.\u201d\n\u201cTheir accounts of the scene agree\u201d\n\u201cNear enough\u2014you never got two witnesses to remember a thing\nexactly alike.",
    "You know that just as well as I do Mr. Poirot.\u201d\nPoirot nodded.",
    "He said thoughtfully\n\u201cYes it will be interesting to see\u2014\u201d He stopped with the sentence\nunfinished.",
    "Hale went on \u201cI instituted a search of the house.",
    "In Mrs. Crale\u2019s\nbedroom I found in a bottom drawer tucked away underneath some\nwinter stockings a small bottle labelled jasmine scent.",
    "It was empty.",
    "I\nfingerprinted it.",
    "The only prints on it were those of Mrs. Crale.",
    "On\n\n\fanalysis it was found to contain faint traces of oil of jasmine and a\nstrong solution of coniine hydrobromide.",
    "\u201cI cautioned Mrs. Crale and showed her the bottle.",
    "She replied\nreadily.",
    "She had she said been in a very unhappy state of mind.",
    "After\nlistening to Mr. Meredith Blake\u2019s description of the drug she had slipped\nback to the laboratory had emptied out a bottle of jasmine scent which\nwas in her bag and had filled the bottle up with coniine solution.",
    "I asked\nher why she had done this and she said \u2018I don\u2019t want to speak of certain\nthings more than I can help but I had received a bad shock.",
    "My husband\nwas proposing to leave me for another woman.",
    "If that was so I didn\u2019t\nwant to live.",
    "That is why I took it.\u2019\u201d\nHale paused.",
    "Poirot said \u201cAfter all\u2014it is likely enough.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps Mr. Poirot.",
    "But it doesn\u2019t square with what she was\noverheard to say.",
    "And then there was a further scene on the following\nmorning.",
    "Mr. Philip Blake overheard a portion of it.",
    "Miss Greer\noverheard a different portion of it.",
    "It took place in the library between\nMr. and Mrs. Crale.",
    "Mr. Blake was in the hall and caught a fragment or\ntwo.",
    "Miss Greer was sitting outside near the open library window and\nheard a good deal more.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what did they hear\u201d\n\u201cMr.",
    "Blake heard Mrs. Crale say \u2018You and your women.",
    "I\u2019d like to\nkill you.",
    "Some day I will kill you.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cNo mention of suicide\u201d\n\u201cExactly.",
    "None at all.",
    "No words like \u2018If you do this thing I\u2019ll kill\nmyself.\u2019 Miss Greer\u2019s evidence was much the same.",
    "According to her\nMr. Crale said \u2018Do try and be reasonable about this Caroline.",
    "I\u2019m fond\nof you and will always wish you well\u2014you and the child.",
    "But I\u2019m going\nto marry Elsa.",
    "We\u2019ve always agreed to leave each other free.\u2019 Mrs. Crale\nanswered to that \u2018Very well don\u2019t say I haven\u2019t warned you.\u2019 He said\n\u2018What do you mean\u2019 And she said \u2018I mean that I love you and I\u2019m not\ngoing to lose you.",
    "I\u2019d rather kill you than let you go to that girl.\u2019\u201d\nPoirot made a slight gesture.",
    "\u201cIt occurs to me\u201d he murmured \u201cthat Miss Greer was singularly\nunwise to raise this issue.",
    "Mrs. Crale could easily have refused her\nhusband a divorce.\u201d\n\u201cWe had some evidence bearing on that point\u201d said Hale.",
    "\u201cMrs.",
    "Crale it seems confided partly in Mr. Meredith Blake.",
    "He was an old\n\n\fand trusted friend.",
    "He was very distressed and managed to get a word\nwith Mr. Crale about it.",
    "This I may say was on the preceding afternoon.",
    "Mr. Blake remonstrated delicately with his friend said how distressed he\nwould be if the marriage between Mr. and Mrs. Crale was to break up so\ndisastrously.",
    "He also stressed the point that Miss Greer was a very young\ngirl and that it was a very serious thing to drag a young girl through the\ndivorce court.",
    "To this Mr. Crale replied with a chuckle callous sort of\nbrute he must have been \u2018That isn\u2019t Elsa\u2019s idea at all.",
    "She isn\u2019t going to\nappear.",
    "We shall fix it up in the usual way.\u2019\u201d\nPoirot said \u201cTherefore even more imprudent of Miss Greer to have\nbroken out the way she did.\u201d\nSuperintendent Hale said\n\u201cOh you know what women are Have to get at each other\u2019s throats.",
    "It must have been a difficult situation anyhow.",
    "I can\u2019t understand Mr.\nCrale allowing it to happen.",
    "According to Mr. Meredith Blake he wanted\nto finish his picture.",
    "Does that make sense to you\u201d\n\u201cYes my friend I think it does.\u201d\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t to me.",
    "The man was asking for trouble\u201d\n\u201cHe was probaby seriously annoyed with his young woman for\nbreaking out the way she did.\u201d\n\u201cOh he was.",
    "Meredith Blake said so.",
    "If he had to finish the picture I\ndon\u2019t see why he couldn\u2019t have taken some photographs and worked\nfrom them.",
    "I know a chap\u2014does watercolours of places\u2014he does that.\u201d\nPoirot shook his head.",
    "\u201cNo\u2014I can understand Crale the artist.",
    "You must realize my friend\nthat at that moment probably his picture was all that mattered to Crale.",
    "However much he wanted to marry the girl the picture came first.",
    "That\u2019s\nwhy he hoped to get through her visit without its coming to an open\nissue.",
    "The girl of course didn\u2019t see it that way.",
    "With women love\nalways comes first.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t I know it\u201d said Superintendent Hale with feeling.",
    "\u201cMen\u201d continued Poirot \u201cand especially artists\u2014are different.\u201d\n\u201cArt\u201d said the Superintendent with scorn.",
    "\u201cAll this talk about Art I\nnever have understood it and I never shall You should have seen that\npicture Crale was painting.",
    "All lopsided.",
    "He\u2019d made the girl look as\nthough she\u2019d got toothache and the battlements were all cockeyed.",
    "Unpleasant looking the whole thing.",
    "I couldn\u2019t get it out of my mind for\na long time afterwards.",
    "I even dreamt about it.",
    "And what\u2019s more it\n\n\faffected my eyesight\u2014I began to see battlements and walls and things\nall out of drawing.",
    "Yes and women too\u201d\nPoirot smiled.",
    "He said\n\u201cAlthough you do not know it you are paying a tribute to the\ngreatness of Amyas Crale\u2019s art.\u201d\n\u201cNonsense.",
    "Why can\u2019t a painter paint something nice and cheerful to\nlook at Why go out of your way to look for ugliness\u201d\n\u201cSome of us mon cher see beauty in curious places.\u201d\n\u201cThe girl was a good looker all right\u201d said Hale.",
    "\u201cLots of makeup\nand next to no clothes on.",
    "It isn\u2019t decent the way these girls go about.",
    "And that was sixteen years ago mind you.",
    "Nowadays one wouldn\u2019t think\nanything of it.",
    "But then\u2014well it shocked me.",
    "Trousers and one of those\ncanvas shirts open at the neck\u2014and not another thing I should say\u201d\n\u201cYou seem to remember these points very well\u201d murmured Poirot\nslyly.",
    "Superintendent Hale blushed.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m just passing on the impression I\ngot\u201d he said austerely.",
    "\u201cQuite\u2014quite\u201d said Poirot soothingly.",
    "He went on\n\u201cSo it would seem that the principal witnesses against Mrs. Crale\nwere Philip Blake and Elsa Greer\u201d\n\u201cYes.",
    "Vehement they were both of them.",
    "But the governess was\ncalled by the prosecution too and what she said carried more weight\nthan the other two.",
    "She was on Mrs. Crale\u2019s side entirely you see.",
    "Up in\narms for her.",
    "But she was an honest woman and gave her evidence\ntruthfully without trying to minimize it in any way.\u201d\n\u201cAnd Meredith Blake\u201d\n\u201cHe was very distressed by the whole thing poor gentleman.",
    "As well\nhe might be Blamed himself for his drug brewing\u2014and the coroner\nblamed him for it too.",
    "Coniine and AE Salts comes under Schedule I of\nthe Poisons Acts.",
    "He came in for some pretty sharp censure.",
    "He was a\nfriend of both parties and it hit him very hard\u2014besides being the kind of\ncounty gentleman who shrinks from notoriety and being in the public\neye.\u201d\n\u201cDid not Mrs. Crale\u2019s young sister give evidence\u201d\n\u201cNo.",
    "It wasn\u2019t necessary.",
    "She wasn\u2019t there when Mrs. Crale\nthreatened her husband and there was nothing she could tell us that we\ncouldn\u2019t get from someone else equally well.",
    "She saw Mrs. Crale go to\nthe refrigerator and get the iced beer out and of course the Defence\n\n\fcould have subp\u0153naed her to say that Mrs. Crale took it straight down\nwithout tampering with it in any way.",
    "But that point wasn\u2019t relevant\nbecause we never claimed that the coniine was in the beer bottle.\u201d\n\u201cHow did she manage to put it in the glass with those two looking\non\u201d\n\u201cWell first of all they weren\u2019t looking on.",
    "That is to say Mr. Crale\nwas painting\u2014looking at his canvas and at the sitter.",
    "And Miss Greer\nwas posed sitting with her back almost to where Mrs. Crale was\nstanding and her eyes looking over Mr. Crale\u2019s shoulder.\u201d\nPoirot nodded.",
    "\u201cAs I say neither of the two was looking at Mrs. Crale.",
    "She had the\nstuff in one of those pipette things\u2014one used to fill fountain pens with\nthem.",
    "We found it crushed to splinters on the path up to the house.\u201d\nPoirot murmured\n\u201cYou have an answer to everything.\u201d\n\u201cWell come now Mr. Poirot Without prejudice.",
    "She threatens to kill\nhim.",
    "She takes the stuff from the laboratory.",
    "The empty bottle is found in\nher room and nobody has handled it but her.",
    "She deliberately takes down\niced beer to him\u2014a funny thing anyway when you realize that they\nweren\u2019t on speaking terms\u2014\u201d\n\u201cA very curious thing.",
    "I had already remarked on it.\u201d\n\u201cYes.",
    "Bit of a give away.",

    "She\narranges to find the body and she sends the other woman off to\ntelephone.",
    "Why So that she can wipe that bottle and glass and then\npress his fingers on it.",
    "After that she can pipe up and say that it was\nremorse and that he committed suicide.",
    "A likely story.\u201d\n\u201cIt was certainly not very well imagined.\u201d\n\u201cNo.",
    "If you ask me she didn\u2019t take the trouble to think.",
    "She was so\neaten up with hate and jealousy.",
    "All she thought of was doing him in.",
    "And then when it\u2019s over when she sees him there dead\u2014well then I\nshould say she suddenly comes to herself and realizes that what she\u2019s\ndone is murder\u2014and that you get hanged for murder.",
    "And desperately\nshe goes baldheaded for the only thing she can think of\u2014which is\nsuicide.\u201d\nPoirot said\n\u201cIt is very sound what you say there\u2014yes.",
    "Her mind might work that\nway.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cIn a way it was a premeditated crime and in a way it wasn\u2019t\u201d said\nHale.",
    "\u201cI don\u2019t believe she really thought it out you know.",
    "Just went on\nwith it blindly.\u201d\nPoirot murmured\n\u201cI wonder\u2026.\u201d\nHale looked at him curiously.",
    "He said\n\u201cHave I convinced you Mr. Poirot that it was a straightforward\ncase\u201d\n\u201cAlmost.",
    "Not quite.",
    "There are one or two peculiar points\u2026\u201d\n\u201cCan you suggest an alternative solution\u2014that will hold water\u201d\nPoirot said\n\u201cWhat were the movements of the other people on that morning\u201d\n\u201cWe went into them I can assure you.",
    "We checked up on everybody.",
    "Nobody had what you could call an alibi\u2014you can\u2019t have with\npoisoning.",
    "Why there\u2019s nothing to prevent a wouldbe murderer from\nhanding his victim some poison in a capsule the day before telling him\nit\u2019s a specific cure for indigestion and he must take it before lunch\u2014and\nthen going away to the other end of England.\u201d\n\u201cBut you don\u2019t think that happened in this case\u201d\n\u201cMr.",
    "Crale didn\u2019t suffer from indigestion.",
    "And in any case I can\u2019t see\nthat kind of thing happening.",
    "It\u2019s true that Mr. Meredith Blake was given\nto recommending quack nostrums of his own concocting but I don\u2019t see\nMr. Crale trying any of them.",
    "And if he did he\u2019d probably talk and joke\nabout it.",
    "Besides why should Mr. Meredith Blake want to kill Mr. Crale\nEverything goes to show that he was on very good terms with him.",
    "They\nall were.",
    "Mr. Philip Blake was his best friend.",
    "Miss Greer was in love\nwith him.",
    "Miss Williams disapproved of him I imagine very strongly\u2014\nbut moral disapprobation doesn\u2019t lead to poisoning.",
    "Little Miss Warren\nscrapped with him a lot she was at a tiresome age\u2014just off to school I\nbelieve but he was quite fond of her and she of him.",
    "She was treated\nyou know with particular tenderness and consideration in that house.",
    "You may have heard why.",
    "She was badly injured when she was a child\u2014\ninjured by Mrs. Crale in a kind of maniacal fit of rage.",
    "That rather\nshows doesn\u2019t it that she was a pretty uncontrolled sort of person To\ngo for a child\u2014and maim her for life\u201d\n\u201cIt might show\u201d said Poirot thoughtfully \u201cthat Angela Warren had\ngood reason to bear a grudge against Caroline Crale.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cPerhaps\u2014but not against Amyas Crale.",
    "And anyway Mrs. Crale was\ndevoted to her young sister\u2014gave her a home when her parents died\nand as I say treated her with special affection\u2014spoiled her badly so\nthey say.",
    "The girl was obviously fond of Mrs. Crale.",
    "She was kept away\nfrom the trial and sheltered from it all as far as possible\u2014Mrs.",
    "Crale was\nvery insistent about that I believe.",
    "But the girl was terribly upset and\nlonged to be taken to see her sister in prison.",
    "Caroline Crale wouldn\u2019t\nagree.",
    "She said that sort of thing might injure a girl\u2019s mentality for life.",
    "She arranged for her to go to school abroad.\u201d\nHe added\n\u201cMiss Warren\u2019s turned out a very distinguished woman.",
    "Traveller to\nweird places.",
    "Lectures at the Royal Geographical\u2014all that sort of thing.\u201d\n\u201cAnd no one remembers the trial\u201d\n\u201cWell it\u2019s a different name for one thing.",
    "They hadn\u2019t even the same\nmaiden name.",
    "They had the same mother but different fathers.",
    "Mrs.\nCrale\u2019s name was Spalding.\u201d\n\u201cThis Miss Williams was she the child\u2019s governess or Angela\nWarren\u2019s\u201d\n\u201cAngela\u2019s.",
    "There was a nurse for the child\u2014but she used to do a few\nlittle lessons with Miss Williams every day I believe.\u201d\n\u201cWhere was the child at the time\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019d gone with the nurse to pay a visit to her grandmother.",
    "A Lady\nTressillian.",
    "A widow lady who\u2019d lost her own two little girls and who\nwas devoted to this kid.\u201d\nPoirot nodded.",
    "\u201cI see.\u201d\nHale continued\n\u201cAs to the movements of the other people on the day of the murder I\ncan give them to you.",
    "\u201cMiss Greer sat on the terrace near the library window after breakfast.",
    "There as I say she overheard the quarrel between Crale and his wife.",
    "After that she accompanied Crale down to the Battery and sat for him\nuntil lunch time with a couple of breaks to ease her muscles.",
    "\u201cPhilip Blake was in the house after breakfast and overheard part of\nthe quarrel.",
    "After Crale and Miss Greer went off he read the paper until\nhis brother telephoned him.",
    "Thereupon he went down to the shore to\nmeet his brother.",
    "They walked together up the path again past the Battery\ngarden.",
    "Miss Greer had just gone up to the house to fetch a pullover as\n\n\fshe felt chilly and Mrs. Crale was with her husband discussing\narrangements for Angela\u2019s departure to school.\u201d\n\u201cAh an amicable interview.\u201d\n\u201cWell no not amicable.",
    "Crale was fairly shouting at her I\nunderstand.",
    "Annoyed at being bothered with domestic details.",
    "I suppose\nshe wanted to get things straightened up if there was going to be a\nbreak.\u201d\nPoirot nodded.",
    "Hale went on\n\u201cThe two brothers exchanged a few words with Amyas Crale.",
    "Then\nMiss Greer reappeared and took up her position and Crale picked up his\nbrush again obviously wanting to get rid of them.",
    "They took the hint and\nwent up to the house.",
    "It was when they were at the Battery by the way\nthat Amyas Crale complained all the beer down there was hot and his\nwife promised to send him down some iced beer.\u201d\n\u201cAha\u201d\n\u201cExactly\u2014Aha Sweet as sugar she was about it.",
    "They went up to the\nhouse and sat on the terrace outside.",
    "Mrs. Crale and Angela Warren\nbrought them out beer there.",
    "\u201cLater Angela Warren went down to bathe and Philip Blake went\nwith her.",
    "\u201cMeredith Blake went down to a clearing with a seat just above the\nBattery garden.",
    "He could just see Miss Greer as she posed on the\nbattlements and could hear her voice and Crale\u2019s as they talked.",
    "He sat\nthere and thought over the coniine business.",
    "He was still very worried\nabout it and didn\u2019t know quite what to do.",
    "Elsa Greer saw him and\nwaved her hand to him.",
    "When the bell went for lunch he came down to\nthe Battery and Elsa Greer and he went back to the house together.",
    "He\nnoticed then that Crale was looking as he put it very queer but he didn\u2019t\nreally think anything of it at the time.",
    "Crale was the kind of man who is\nnever ill\u2014and so one didn\u2019t imagine he would be.",
    "On the other hand he\ndid have moods of fury and despondency according as to whether his\npainting was not going as he liked it.",
    "On those occasions one left him\nalone and said as little as possible to him.",
    "That\u2019s what these two did on\nthis occasion.",
    "\u201cAs to the others the servants were busy with housework and\ncooking lunch.",
    "Miss Williams was in the schoolroom part of the morning\ncorrecting some exercise books.",
    "Afterwards she took some household\n\n\fmending to the terrace.",
    "Angela Warren spent most of the morning\nwandering about the garden climbing trees and eating things\u2014you know\nwhat a girl of fifteen is Plums sour apples hard pears etc.",
    "After she\ncame back to the house and as I say went down with Philip Blake to the\nbeach and had a bathe before lunch.\u201d\nSuperintendent Hale paused\n\u201cNow then\u201d he said belligerently \u201cdo you find anything phoney\nabout that\u201d\nPoirot said \u201cNothing at all.\u201d\n\u201cWell then\u201d\nThe two words expressed volumes.",
    "\u201cBut all the same\u201d said Hercule Poirot.",
    "\u201cI am going to satisfy myself.",
    "I\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you going to do\u201d\n\u201cI am going to visit these five people\u2014and from each one I am going\nto get his or her own story.\u201d\nSuperintendent Hale sighed with a deep melancholy.",
    "He said\n\u201cMan you\u2019re nuts None of their stories are going to agree Don\u2019t\nyou grasp that elementary fact No two people remember a thing in the\nsame order anyway.",
    "And after all this time Why you\u2019ll hear five\naccounts of five separate murders\u201d\n\u201cThat\u201d said Poirot \u201cis what I am counting upon.",
    "It will be very\ninstructive.\u201d\n\n\f\fSix\nTHIS LITTLE PIG WENT TO MARKET\u2026\n\nPhilip Blake was recognizably like the description given of him by\nMontague Depleach.",
    "A prosperous shrewd joviallooking man\u2014\nslightly running to fat.",
    "Hercule Poirot had timed his appointment for half past six on a\nSaturday afternoon.",
    "Philip Blake had just finished his eighteen holes and\nhe had been on his game\u2014winning a fiver from his opponent.",
    "He was in\nthe mood to be friendly and expansive.",
    "Hercule Poirot explained himself and his errand.",
    "On this occasion at\nleast he showed no undue passion for unsullied truth.",
    "It was a question\nBlake gathered of a series of books dealing with famous crimes.",
    "Philip Blake frowned.",
    "He said\n\u201cGood Lord why make up these things\u201d\nHercule Poirot shrugged his shoulders.",
    "He was at his most foreign\ntoday.",
    "He was out to be despised but patronized.",
    "He murmured\n\u201cIt is the public.",
    "They eat it up\u2014yes eat it up.\u201d\n\u201cGhouls\u201d said Philip Blake.",
    "But he said it goodhumouredly\u2014not with the fastidiousness and the\ndistaste that a more sensitive man might have displayed.",
    "Hercule Poirot said with a shrug of the shoulders\n\u201cIt is human nature.",
    "You and I Mr. Blake who know the world have\nno illusions about our fellow human beings.",
    "Not bad people most of\nthem but certainly not to be idealized.\u201d\nBlake said heartily\n\u201cI\u2019ve parted with my illusions long ago.\u201d\n\u201cInstead you tell a very good story so I have been told.\u201d\n\u201cAh\u201d Blake\u2019s eyes twinkled.",
    "\u201cHeard this one\u201d\nPoirot\u2019s laugh came at the right place.",
    "It was not an edifying story but\nit was funny.",
    "Philip Blake lay back in his chair his muscles relaxed his eyes\ncreased with good humour.",
    "Hercule Poirot thought suddenly that he looked rather like a\ncontented pig.",
    "A pig.",
    "This little pig went to market\u2026.",
    "What was he like this man this Philip Blake A man it would seem\nwithout cares.",
    "Prosperous contented.",
    "No remorseful thoughts no uneasy\ntwinges of conscience from the past no haunting memories here.",
    "No a\nwellfed pig who had gone to market\u2014and fetched the full market\nprice\u2026.",
    "But once perhaps there had been more to Philip Blake.",
    "He must have\nbeen when young a handsome man.",
    "Eyes always a shade too small a\nfraction too near together perhaps\u2014but otherwise a well made well set\nup young man.",
    "How old was he now At a guess between fifty and sixty.",
    "Nearing forty then at the time of Crale\u2019s death.",
    "Less stultified then less\nsunk in the gratifications of the minute.",
    "Asking more of life perhaps\nand receiving less\u2026.",
    "Poirot murmured as a mere catchphrase\n\u201cYou comprehend my position.\u201d\n\u201cNo really you know I\u2019m hanged if I do.\u201d The stockbroker sat\nupright again his glance was once more shrewd.",
    "\u201cWhy you You\u2019re not\na writer\u201d\n\u201cNot precisely\u2014no.",
    "Actually I am a detective.\u201d\nThe modesty of this remark had probably not been equalled before in\nPoirot\u2019s conversation.",
    "\u201cOf course you are.",
    "We all know that.",
    "The famous Hercule Poirot\u201d\nBut his tone held a subtly mocking note.",
    "Intrinsically Philip Blake\nwas too much of an Englishman to take the pretensions of a foreigner\nseriously.",
    "To his cronies he would have said\n\u201cQuaint little mountebank.",
    "Oh well I expect his stuff goes down with\nthe women all right.\u201d\nAnd although that derisive patronizing attitude was exactly the one\nwhich Hercule Poirot had aimed at inducing nevertheless he found\nhimself annoyed by it.",
    "This man this successful man of affairs was unimpressed by Hercule\nPoirot It was a scandal.",
    "\u201cI am gratified\u201d said Poirot untruly \u201cthat I am so well known to you.",
    "My success let me tell you has been founded on the psychology\u2014the\neternal why of human behaviour.",
    "That Mr. Blake is what interests the\nworld in crime today.",
    "It used to be romance.",
    "Famous crimes were retold\nfrom one angle only\u2014the love story connected with them.",
    "Nowadays it\n\n\fis very different.",
    "People read with interest that Dr. Crippen murdered his\nwife because she was a big bouncing woman and he was little and\ninsignificant and therefore she made him feel inferior.",
    "They read of some\nfamous woman criminal that she killed because she\u2019d been snubbed by\nher father when she was three years old.",
    "It is as I say the why of crime\nthat interests nowadays.\u201d\nPhilip Blake said with a slight yawn\n\u201cThe why of most crimes is obvious enough I should say.",
    "Usually\nmoney.\u201d\nPoirot cried\n\u201cAh but my dear sir the why must never be obvious.",
    "That is the\nwhole point\u201d\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s where you come in\u201d\n\u201cAnd that as you say is where I come in It is proposed to rewrite the\nstories of certain bygone crimes\u2014from the psychological angle.",
    "Psychology in crime it is my speciality.",
    "I have accepted the\ncommission.\u201d\nPhilip Blake grinned.",
    "\u201cPretty lucrative I suppose\u201d\n\u201cI hope so\u2014I certainly hope so.\u201d\n\u201cCongratulations.",
    "Now perhaps you\u2019ll tell me where I come in\u201d\n\u201cMost certainly.",
    "The Crale case Monsieur.\u201d\nPhillip Blake did not look startled.",
    "But he looked thoughtful.",
    "He said\n\u201cYes of course the Crale case\u2026.\u201d\nHercule Poirot said anxiously\n\u201cIt is not displeasing to you Mr. Blake\u201d\n\u201cOh as to that.\u201d Philip Blake shrugged his shoulders.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s no use\nresenting a thing that you\u2019ve no power to stop.",
    "The trial of Caroline\nCrale is public property.",
    "Anyone can go ahead and write it up.",
    "It\u2019s no use\nmy objecting.",
    "In a way\u2014I don\u2019t mind telling you\u2014I do dislike it a good\ndeal.",
    "Amyas Crale was one of my best friends.",
    "I\u2019m sorry the whole\nunsavoury business has to be raked up again.",
    "But these things happen.\u201d\n\u201cYou are a philosopher Mr. Blake.\u201d\n\u201cNo no.",
    "I just know enough not to start kicking against the pricks.",
    "I\ndare say you\u2019ll do it less offensively than many others.\u201d\n\u201cI hope at least to write with delicacy and good taste\u201d said Poirot.",
    "Philip Blake gave a loud guffaw but without any real amusement.",
    "\u201cMakes me chuckle to hear you say that.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cI assure you Mr. Blake I am really interested.",
    "It is not just a matter\nof money with me.",
    "I genuinely want to recreate the past to feel and see\nthe events that took place to see behind the obvious and to visualize the\nthoughts and feelings of the actors in the drama.\u201d\nPhilip Blake said\n\u201cI don\u2019t know that there was much subtlety about it.",
    "It was a pretty\nobvious business.",
    "Crude female jealousy that was all there was to it.\u201d\n\u201cIt would interest me enormously Mr. Blake if I could have your\nown reactions to the affair.\u201d\nPhilip Blake said with sudden heat his face deepening in colour.",
    "\u201cReactions Reactions Don\u2019t speak so pedantically.",
    "I didn\u2019t just stand\nthere and react You don\u2019t seem to understand that my friend\u2014my friend\nI tell you had been killed\u2014poisoned And that if I\u2019d acted quicker I\ncould have saved him.\u201d\n\u201cHow do you make that out Mr. Blake\u201d\n\u201cLike this.",
    "I take it that you\u2019ve already read up the facts of the case\u201d\nPoirot nodded.",
    "\u201cVery well.",
    "Now on that morning my brother Meredith\ncalled me up.",
    "He was in a pretty good stew.",
    "One of his Hell brews was\nmissing\u2014and it was a fairly deadly Hell brew.",
    "What did I do I told him\nto come along and we\u2019d talk it over.",
    "Decide what was best to be done.",
    "\u2018Decide what was best.\u2019 It beats me now how I could have been such a\nhesitating fool I ought to have realized that there was no time to lose.",
    "I\nought to have gone to Amyas straight away and warned him.",
    "I ought to\nhave said \u2018Caroline\u2019s pinched one of Meredith\u2019s patent poisons and you\nand Elsa had better look out for yourselves.\u2019\u201d\nBlake got up.",
    "He strode up and down in his excitement.",
    "\u201cGood God man.",
    "Do you suppose I haven\u2019t gone over it in my mind\nagain and again I knew.",
    "I had the chance to save him\u2014and I dallied\nabout\u2014waiting for Meredith Why hadn\u2019t I the sense to realize that\nCaroline wasn\u2019t going to have any qualms or hesitancies.",
    "She\u2019d taken\nthat stuff to use\u2014and by God she\u2019d used it at the very first opportunity.",
    "She wouldn\u2019t wait till Meredith discovered his loss.",
    "I knew\u2014of course I\nknew\u2014that Amyas was in deadly danger\u2014and I did nothing\u201d\n\u201cI think you reproach yourself unduly Monsieur.",
    "You had not much\ntime\u2014\u201d\nThe other interrupted him\n\u201cTime I had plenty of time.",
    "Any amount of courses open to me.",
    "I\ncould have gone to Amyas as I say\u2014but there was the chance of\n\n\fcourse that he wouldn\u2019t believe me.",
    "Amyas wasn\u2019t the sort of man\nwho\u2019d believe easily in his own danger.",
    "He\u2019d have scoffed at the notion.",
    "And he never thoroughly understood the sort of devil Caroline was.",
    "But I\ncould have gone to her.",
    "I could have said \u2018I know what you\u2019re up to.",
    "I\nknow what you\u2019re planning to do.",
    "But if Amyas or Elsa die of coniine\npoisoning you\u2019ll be hanged by your neck\u2019 That would have stopped her.",
    "Or I might have rung up the police.",
    "Oh there were things that could\nhave been done\u2014and instead I let myself be influenced by Meredith\u2019s\nslow cautious methods.",
    "\u2018We must be sure\u2014talk it over\u2014make quite\ncertain who could have taken it\u2026\u2019 Damned old fool\u2014never made a\nquick decision in his life A good thing for him he was the eldest son and\nhas an estate to live on.",
    "If he\u2019d ever tried to make money he\u2019d have lost\nevery penny he had.\u201d\nPoirot asked\n\u201cYou had no doubt yourself who had taken the poison\u201d\n\u201cOf course not.",
    "I knew at once it must be Caroline.",
    "You see I knew\nCaroline very well.\u201d\nPoirot said\n\u201cThat is very interesting.",
    "I want to know Mr. Blake what kind of a\nwoman Caroline Crale was\u201d\nPhilip Blake said sharply\n\u201cShe wasn\u2019t the injured innocent people thought she was at the time\nof the trial\u201d\n\u201cWhat was she then\u201d\nBlake sat down again.",
    "He said seriously\n\u201cWould you really like to know\u201d\n\u201cI would like to know very much indeed.\u201d\n\u201cCaroline was a rotter.",
    "She was a rotter through and through.",
    "Mind\nyou she had charm.",
    "She had that kind of sweetness of manner that\ndeceives people utterly.",
    "She had a frail helpless look about her that\nappealed to people\u2019s chivalry.",
    "Sometimes when I\u2019ve read a bit of history\nI think Mary Queen of Scots must have been a bit like her.",
    "Always sweet\nand unfortunate and magnetic\u2014and actually a cold calculating woman a\nscheming woman who planned the murder of Darnley and got away with\nit.",
    "Caroline was like that\u2014a cold calculating planner.",
    "And she had a\nwicked temper.",
    "\u201cI don\u2019t know whether they\u2019ve told you\u2014it isn\u2019t a vital point of the\ntrial but it shows her up\u2014what she did to her baby sister She was\n\n\fjealous you know.",
    "Her mother had married again and all the notice and\naffection went to little Angela.",
    "Caroline couldn\u2019t stand that.",
    "She tried to\nkill the baby with a crowbar\u2014smash its head in.",
    "Luckily the blow wasn\u2019t\nfatal.",
    "But it was a pretty ghastly thing to do.\u201d\n\u201cYes indeed.\u201d\n\u201cWell that was the real Caroline.",
    "She had to be first.",
    "That was the\nthing she simply could not stand\u2014not being first.",
    "And there was a cold\negotistical devil in her that was capable of being stirred to murderous\nlengths.",
    "\u201cShe appeared impulsive you know but she was really calculating.",
    "When she stayed at Alderbury as a girl she gave us all the once over and\nmade her plans.",
    "She\u2019d no money of her own.",

    "Funny that I could probably\nbuy up Meredith and Crale if he\u2019d lived nowadays She considered\nMeredith for a bit but she finally fixed on Amyas.",
    "Amyas would have\nAlderbury and though he wouldn\u2019t have much money with it she\nrealized that his talent as a painter was something quite out of the way.",
    "She gambled on his being not only a genius but a financial success as\nwell.",
    "\u201cAnd she won.",
    "Recognition came to Amyas early.",
    "He wasn\u2019t a\nfashionable painter exactly\u2014but his genius was recognized and his\npictures were bought.",
    "Have you seen any of his paintings There\u2019s one\nhere.",
    "Come and look at it.\u201d\nHe led the way into the dining room and pointed to the lefthand wall.",
    "\u201cThere you are.",
    "That\u2019s Amyas.\u201d\nPoirot looked in silence.",
    "It came to him with fresh amazement that a\nman could so imbue a conventional subject with his own particular\nmagic.",
    "A vase of roses on a polished mahogany table.",
    "That hoary old set\npiece.",
    "How then did Amyas Crale contrive to make his roses flame and\nburn with a riotous almost obscene life.",
    "The polished wood of the table\ntrembled and took on sentient life.",
    "How explain the excitement the\npicture roused For it was exciting.",
    "The proportions of the table would\nhave distressed Superintendent Hale he would have complained that no\nknown roses were precisely of that shape or colour.",
    "And afterwards he\nwould have gone about wondering vaguely why the roses he saw were\nunsatisfactory and round mahogany tables would have annoyed him for\nno known reason.",
    "Poirot gave a little sigh.",
    "He murmured\n\u201cYes\u2014it is all there.\u201d\nBlake led the way back.",
    "He mumbled\n\u201cNever have understood anything about art myself.",
    "Don\u2019t know why I\nlike looking at that thing so much but I do.",
    "It\u2019s\u2014oh damn it all it\u2019s\ngood.\u201d\nPoirot nodded emphatically.",
    "Blake offered his guest a cigarette and lit one himself.",
    "He said\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s the man\u2014the man who painted those roses\u2014the man\nwho painted the \u2018Woman with a Cocktail Shaker\u2019\u2014the man who painted\nthat amazing painful \u2018Nativity\u2019 that\u2019s the man who was cut short in his\nprime deprived of his vivid forceful life all because of a vindictive\nmeannatured woman\u201d\nHe paused\n\u201cYou\u2019ll say that I\u2019m bitter\u2014that I\u2019m unduly prejudiced against\nCaroline.",
    "She had charm\u2014I\u2019ve felt it.",
    "But I knew\u2014I always knew\u2014the\nreal woman behind.",
    "And that woman Mr. Poirot was evil.",
    "She was cruel\nand malignant and a grabber\u201d\n\u201cAnd yet it has been told me that Mrs. Crale put up with many hard\nthings in her married life\u201d\n\u201cYes and didn\u2019t she let everybody know about it Always the martyr\nPoor old Amyas.",
    "His married life was one long hell\u2014or rather it would\nhave been if it hadn\u2019t been for his exceptional quality.",
    "His art you see\u2014\nhe always had that.",
    "It was an escape.",
    "When he was painting he didn\u2019t\ncare he shook off Caroline and her nagging and all the ceaseless rows\nand quarrels.",
    "They were endless you know.",
    "Not a week passed without a\nthundering row over one thing or another.",
    "She enjoyed it.",
    "Having rows\nstimulated her I believe.",
    "It was an outlet.",
    "She could say all the hard\nbitter stinging things she wanted to say.",
    "She\u2019d positively purr after one of\nthose settos\u2014go off looking as sleek and wellfed as a cat.",
    "But it took it\nout of him.",
    "He wanted peace\u2014rest\u2014a quiet life.",
    "Of course a man like\nthat ought never to marry\u2014he isn\u2019t out for domesticity.",
    "A man like Crale\nshould have affairs but no binding ties.",
    "They\u2019re bound to chafe him.\u201d\n\u201cHe confided in you\u201d\n\u201cWell\u2014he knew that I was a pretty devoted pal.",
    "He let me see things.",
    "He didn\u2019t complain.",
    "He wasn\u2019t that kind of man.",
    "Sometimes he\u2019d say\n\u2018Damn all women.\u2019 Or he\u2019d say \u2018Never get married old boy.",
    "Wait for\nhell till after this life.\u2019\u201d\n\n\f\u201cYou knew about his attachment to Miss Greer\u201d\n\u201cOh yes\u2014at least I saw it coming on.",
    "He told me he\u2019d met a\nmarvellous girl.",
    "She was different he said from anything or anyone he\u2019d\never met before.",
    "Not that I paid much attention to that.",
    "Amyas was\nalways meeting one woman or other who was \u2018different.\u2019 Usually a\nmonth later he\u2019d stare at you if you mentioned them and wonder who\nyou were talking about But this Elsa Greer really was different.",
    "I\nrealized that when I came down to Alderbury to stay.",
    "She\u2019d got him you\nknow hooked him good and proper.",
    "The poor mutt fairly ate out of her\nhand.\u201d\n\u201cYou did not like Elsa Greer either\u201d\n\u201cNo I didn\u2019t like her.",
    "She was definitely a predatory creature.",
    "She\ntoo wanted to own Crale body and soul.",
    "But I think all the same that\nshe\u2019d have been better for him than Caroline.",
    "She might conceivably\nhave let him alone once she was sure of him.",
    "Or she might have got tired\nof him and moved on to someone else.",
    "The best thing for Amyas would\nhave been to be quite free of female entanglements.\u201d\n\u201cBut that it would seem was not to his taste\u201d\nPhilip Blake said with a sigh\n\u201cThe damned fool was always getting himself involved with some\nwoman or other.",
    "And yet in a way women really meant very little to\nhim.",
    "The only two women who really made any impression on him at all\nin his life were Caroline and Elsa.\u201d\nPoirot said\n\u201cWas he fond of the child\u201d\n\u201cAngela Oh we all liked Angela.",
    "She was such a sport.",
    "She was\nalways game for anything.",
    "What a life she led that wretched governess of\nhers.",
    "Yes Amyas liked Angela all right\u2014but sometimes she went too far\nand then he used to get really mad with her\u2014and then Caroline would\nstep in\u2014Caro was always on Angela\u2019s side and that would finish Amyas\naltogether.",
    "He hated it when Caro sided with Angela against him.",
    "There\nwas a bit of jealousy all round you know.",
    "Amyas was jealous of the way\nCaro always put Angela first and would do anything for her.",
    "And Angela\nwas jealous of Amyas and rebelled against his overbearing ways.",
    "It was\nhis decision that she should go to school that autumn and she was\nfurious about it.",
    "Not I think because she didn\u2019t like the idea of school\nshe really rather wanted to go I believe\u2014but it was Amyas\u2019s highhanded way of settling it all offhand that infuriated her.",
    "She played all\n\n\fsorts of tricks on him in revenge.",
    "Once she put ten slugs in his bed.",
    "On\nthe whole I think Amyas was right.",
    "It was time she got some discipline.",
    "Miss Williams was very efficient but even she confessed that Angela\nwas getting too much for her.\u201d\nHe paused.",
    "Poirot said\n\u201cWhen I asked if Amyas was fond of the child\u2014I referred to his own\nchild his daughter\u201d\n\u201cOh you mean little Carla Yes she was a great pet.",
    "He enjoyed\nplaying with her when he was in the mood.",
    "But his affection for her\nwouldn\u2019t have deterred him from marrying Elsa if that\u2019s what you mean.",
    "He hadn\u2019t that kind of feeling for her.\u201d\n\u201cWas Caroline Crale very devoted to the child\u201d A kind of spasm\ncontorted Philip\u2019s face.",
    "He said\n\u201cI can\u2019t say that she wasn\u2019t a good mother.",
    "No I can\u2019t say that.",
    "It\u2019s\nthe one thing\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYes Mr. Blake\u201d\nPhilip said slowly and painfully\n\u201cIt\u2019s the one thing I really\u2014regret\u2014in this affair.",
    "The thought of that\nchild.",
    "Such a tragic background to her young life.",
    "They sent her abroad\nto Amyas\u2019s cousin and her husband.",
    "I hope\u2014I sincerely hope\u2014they\nmanaged to keep the truth from her.\u201d\nPoirot shook his head.",
    "He said\n\u201cThe truth Mr. Blake has a habit of making itself known.",
    "Even after\nmany years.\u201d\nThe stockbroker murmured \u201cI wonder.\u201d\nPoirot went on\n\u201cIn the interests of truth Mr. Blake I am going to ask you to do\nsomething.\u201d\n\u201cWhat is it\u201d\n\u201cI am going to beg that you will write me out an exact account of\nwhat happened on those days at Alderbury.",
    "That is to say I am going to\nask you to write me out a full account of the murder and its attendant\ncircumstances.\u201d\n\u201cBut my dear fellow after all this time I should be hopelessly\ninaccurate.\u201d\n\u201cNot necessarily.\u201d\n\u201cSurely.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cNo for one thing with the passage of time the mind retains a hold\non essentials and rejects superficial matters.\u201d\n\u201cHo You mean a mere broad outline\u201d\n\u201cNot at all.",
    "I mean a detailed conscientious account of each event as it\noccurred and every conversation you can remember.\u201d\n\u201cAnd supposing I remember them wrong\u201d\n\u201cYou can give the wording at least to the best of your reflection.",
    "There may be gaps but that cannot be helped.\u201d\nBlake looked at him curiously.",
    "\u201cBut what\u2019s the idea The police files will give you the whole thing\nfar more accurately.\u201d\n\u201cNo Mr. Blake.",
    "We are speaking now from the psychological point of\nview.",
    "I do not want bare facts.",
    "I want your own selections of facts.",
    "Time\nand your memory are responsible for that selection.",
    "There may have\nbeen things done words spoken that I should seek for in vain in the\npolice files.",
    "Things and words that you never mentioned because maybe\nyou judged them irrelevant or because you preferred not to repeat\nthem.\u201d\nBlake said sharply\n\u201cIs this account of mine for publication\u201d\n\u201cCertainly not.",
    "It is for my eye only.",
    "To assist me to draw my own\ndeductions.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you won\u2019t quote from it without my consent\u201d\n\u201cCertainly not.\u201d\n\u201cHm\u201d said Philip Blake.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m a very busy man Mr. Poirot.\u201d\n\u201cI appreciate that there will be time and trouble involved.",
    "I should be\nhappy to agree to a\u2014reasonable fee.\u201d\nThere was a moment\u2019s pause.",
    "Then Philip Blake said suddenly\n\u201cNo if I do it\u2014I\u2019ll do it for nothing.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you will do it\u201d\nPhilip said warningly\n\u201cRemember I can\u2019t vouch for the accuracy of my memory.\u201d\n\u201cThat is perfectly understood.\u201d\n\u201cThen I think\u201d said Philip Blake \u201cthat I should like to do it.",
    "I feel I\nowe it\u2014in a way\u2014to Amyas Crale.\u201d\n\n\f\fSeven\nTHIS LITTLE PIG STAYED AT HOME\n\nHercule Poirot was not a man to neglect details.",
    "His advance towards Meredith Blake was carefully thought out.",
    "Meredith Blake was he already felt sure a very different proposition\nfrom Philip Blake.",
    "Rush tactics would not succeed here.",
    "The assault\nmust be leisurely.",
    "Hercule Poirot knew that there was only one way to penetrate the\nstronghold.",
    "He must approach Meredith Blake with the proper\ncredentials.",
    "Those credentials must be social not professional.",
    "Fortunately in the course of his career Hercule Poirot had made friends\nin many counties.",
    "Devonshire was no exception.",
    "He sat down to review\nwhat resources he had in Devonshire.",
    "As a result he discovered two\npeople who were acquaintances or friends of Mr. Meredith Blake.",
    "He\ndescended upon him therefore armed with two letters one from Lady\nMary LyttonGore a gentle widow lady of restricted means the most\nretiring of creatures and the other from a retired Admiral whose family\nhad been settled in the county for four generations.",
    "Meredith Blake received Poirot in a state of some perplexity.",
    "As he had often felt lately things were not what they used to be.",
    "Dash\nit all private detectives used to be private detectives\u2014fellows you got to\nguard wedding presents at country receptions fellows you went to\u2014\nrather shamefacedly\u2014when there was some dirty business afoot and\nyou\u2019d got to get the hang of it.",
    "But here was Lady Mary LyttonGore writing \u201cHercule Poirot is a\nvery old and valued friend of mine.",
    "Please do all you can to help him\nwon\u2019t you\u201d And Mary LyttonGore wasn\u2019t\u2014no decidedly she wasn\u2019t\u2014\nthe sort of woman you associate with private detectives and all that they\nstand for.",
    "And Admiral Cronshaw wrote \u201cVery good chap\u2014absolutely\nsound.",
    "Grateful if you will do what you can for him.",
    "Most entertaining\nfellow can tell you lots of good stories.\u201d\nAnd now here was the man himself.",
    "Really a most impossible person\n\u2014the wrong clothes\u2014button boots\u2014an incredible moustache Not his\n\u2014Meredith Blake\u2019s\u2014kind of fellow at all.",
    "Didn\u2019t look as though he\u2019d\never hunted or shot\u2014or even played a decent game.",
    "A foreigner.",
    "Slightly amused Hercule Poirot read accurately these thoughts\npassing through the other\u2019s head.",
    "He had felt his own interest rising considerably as the train brought\nhim into the West Country.",
    "He would see now with his own eyes the\nactual place where these long past events happened.",
    "It was here at Handcross Manor that two young brothers had lived\nand gone over to Alderbury and joked and played tennis and fraternized\nwith a young Amyas Crale and a girl called Caroline.",
    "It was from here\nthat Meredith had started out to Alderbury on that fatal morning.",
    "That\nhad been sixteen years ago.",
    "Hercule Poirot looked with interest at the\nman who was confronting him with somewhat uneasy politeness.",
    "Very much what he had expected.",
    "Meredith Blake resembled\nsuperficially every other English country gentleman of straitened means\nand outdoor tastes.",
    "A shabby old coat of Harris tweed a weatherbeaten pleasant\nmiddleaged face with somewhat faded blue eyes a weak mouth half\nhidden by a rather straggly moustache.",
    "Poirot found Meredith Blake a\ngreat contrast to his brother.",
    "He had a hesitating manner his mental\nprocesses were obviously leisurely.",
    "It was as though his tempo had\nslowed down with the years just as his brother\u2019s had been accelerated.",
    "As Poirot had already guessed he was a man whom you could not\nhurry.",
    "The leisurely life of the English countryside was in his bones.",
    "He looked the detective thought a good deal older than his brother\nthough from what Mr. Jonathan had said it would seem that only a\ncouple of years separated them.",
    "Hercule Poirot prided himself on knowing how to handle an \u201cold\nschool tie.\u201d It was no moment for trying to seem English.",
    "No one must\nbe a foreigner\u2014frankly a foreigner\u2014and be magnanimously forgiven for\nthe fact.",
    "\u201cOf course these foreigners don\u2019t quite know the ropes.",
    "Will\nshake hands at breakfast.",
    "Still a decent fellow really\u2026.\u201d\nPoirot set about creating this impression of himself.",
    "The two men\ntalked cautiously of Lady Mary LyttonGore and of Admiral Cronshaw.",
    "Other names were mentioned.",
    "Fortunately Poirot knew someone\u2019s cousin\nand had met somebody else\u2019s sisterinlaw.",
    "He could see a kind of\nwarmth dawning in the Squire\u2019s eye.",
    "The fellow seemed to know the\nright people.",
    "Gracefully insidiously Poirot slid into the purpose of his visit.",
    "He\nwas quick to counteract the inevitable recoil.",
    "This book was alas going\n\n\fto be written.",
    "Miss Crale\u2014Miss Lemarchant as she was now called\u2014\nwas anxious for him to exercise a judicious editorship.",
    "The facts\nunfortunately were public property.",
    "But much could be done in their\npresentation to avoid wounding susceptibilities.",
    "Poirot murmured that\nbefore now he had been able to use discreet influence to avoid certain\npurple passages in a book of memoirs.",
    "Meredith Blake flushed angrily.",
    "His hand shook a little as he filled a\npipe.",
    "He said a slight stammer in his voice\n\u201cIt\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s gghoulish the way they dig these things up.",
    "Ssixteen\nyears ago.",
    "Why can\u2019t they let it be\u201d\nPoirot shrugged his shoulders.",
    "He said\n\u201cI agree with you.",
    "But what will you There is a demand for such\nthings.",
    "And anyone is at liberty to reconstruct a proved crime and to\ncomment on it.\u201d\n\u201cSeems disgraceful to me.\u201d\nPoirot murmured\n\u201cAlas\u2014we do not live in a delicate age\u2026You would be surprised\nMr. Blake if you knew the unpleasant publications I had succeeded in\u2014\nshall we say\u2014softening.",
    "I am anxious to do all I can to save Miss Crale\u2019s\nfeeling in the matter.\u201d\nMeredith Blake murmured \u201cLittle Carla That child A grownup\nwoman.",
    "One can hardly believe it.\u201d\n\u201cI know.",
    "Time flies swiftly does it not\u201d\nMeredith Blake sighed.",
    "He said \u201cToo quickly.\u201d\nPoirot said\n\u201cAs you will have seen in the letter I handed you from Miss Crale\nshe is very anxious to know everything possible about the sad events of\nthe past.\u201d\nMeredith Blake said with a touch of irritation\n\u201cWhy Why rake up everything again How much better to let it all\nbe forgotten.\u201d\n\u201cYou say that Mr. Blake because you know all the past too well.",
    "Miss Crale remember knows nothing.",
    "That is to say she knows only the\nstory as she has learnt it from the official accounts.\u201d\nMeredith Blake winced.",
    "He said\n\u201cYes I forgot.",
    "Poor child.",
    "What a detestable position for her.",
    "The\nshock of learning the truth.",
    "And then\u2014those soulless callous reports of\nthe trial.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cThe truth\u201d said Hercule Poirot \u201ccan never be done justice to in a\nmere legal recital.",
    "It is the things that are left out that are the things that\nmatter.",
    "The emotions the feelings\u2014the characters of the actors in the\ndrama.",
    "The extenuating circumstances\u2014\u201d\nHe paused and the other man spoke eagerly like an actor who had\nreceived his cue.",
    "\u201cExtenuating circumstances That\u2019s just it.",
    "If ever there were\nextenuating circumstances there were in this case.",
    "Amyas Crale was an\nold friend\u2014his family and mine had been friends for generations but\none has to admit that his conduct was frankly outrageous.",
    "He was an\nartist of course and presumably that explains it.",
    "But there it is\u2014he\nallowed a most extraordinary set of affairs to arise.",
    "The position was one\nthat no ordinary decent man could have contemplated for a moment.\u201d\nHercule Poirot said\n\u201cI am interested that you should say that.",
    "It had puzzled me that\nsituation.",
    "Not so does a wellbred man a man of the world go about his\naffairs.\u201d\nBlake\u2019s thin hesitating face had lit up with animation.",
    "He said\n\u201cYes but the whole point is that Amyas never was an ordinary man\nHe was a painter you see and with him painting came first\u2014really\nsometimes in the most extraordinary way I don\u2019t understand these socalled artistic people myself\u2014never have.",
    "I understood Crale a little\nbecause of course I\u2019d known him all my life.",
    "His people were the same\nsort as my people.",
    "And in many ways Crale ran true to type\u2014it was only\nwhere art came in that he didn\u2019t conform to the usual standards.",
    "He\nwasn\u2019t you see an amateur in any way.",
    "He was firstclass\u2014really firstclass.",
    "Some people say he\u2019s a genius.",
    "They may be right.",
    "But as a result\nhe was always what I should describe as unbalanced.",
    "When he was\npainting a picture\u2014nothing else mattered nothing could be allowed to\nget in the way.",
    "He was like a man in a dream.",
    "Completely obsessed by\nwhat he was doing.",
    "Not till the canvas was finished did he come out of\nthis absorption and start to pick up the threads of ordinary life again.\u201d\nHe looked questioningly at Poirot and the latter nodded.",
    "\u201cYou understand I see.",
    "Well that explains I think why this\nparticular situation arose.",
    "He was in love with this girl.",
    "He wanted to\nmarry her.",
    "He was prepared to leave his wife and child for her.",
    "But he\u2019d\nstarted painting her down here and he wanted to finish that picture.",
    "Nothing else mattered to him.",
    "He didn\u2019t see anything else.",
    "And the fact\n\n\fthat the situation was a perfectly impossible one for the two women\nconcerned doesn\u2019t seem to have occurred to him.\u201d\n\u201cDid either of them understand his point of view\u201d\n\u201cOh yes\u2014in a way.",
    "Elsa did I suppose.",
    "She was terrifically\nenthusiastic about his painting.",
    "But it was a difficult position for her\u2014\nnaturally.",
    "And as for Caroline\u2014\u201d\nHe stopped.",
    "Poirot said\n\u201cFor Caroline\u2014yes indeed.\u201d\nMeredith Blake said speaking with a little difficulty\n\u201cCaroline\u2014I had always\u2014well I had always been very fond of\nCaroline.",
    "There was a time when\u2014when I hoped to marry her.",
    "But that\nwas soon nipped in the bud.",
    "Still I remained if I may say so devoted to\n\u2014to her service.\u201d\nPoirot nodded thoughtfully.",
    "That slightly oldfashioned phrase\nexpressed he felt the man before him very typically.",
    "Meredith Blake\nwas the kind of man who would devote himself readily to a romantic and\nhonourable devotion.",
    "He would serve his lady faithfully and without\nhope of reward.",
    "Yes it was all very much in character.",
    "He said carefully weighing the words\n\u201cYou must have resented this\u2014attitude\u2014on her behalf\u201d\n\u201cI did.",
    "Oh I did.",
    "I\u2014I actually remonstrated with Crale on the\nsubject.\u201d\n\u201cWhen was this\u201d\n\u201cActually the day before\u2014before it all happened.",
    "They came over to\ntea here you know.",
    "I got Crale aside and I\u2014I put it to him.",
    "I even said I\nremember that it wasn\u2019t fair on either of them.\u201d\n\u201cAh you said that\u201d\n\u201cYes.",
    "I didn\u2019t think\u2014you see that he realized.\u201d\n\u201cPossibly not.\u201d\n\u201cI said to him that it was putting Caroline in a perfectly unendurable\nposition.",
    "If he meant to marry this girl he ought not to have her staying\nin the house and\u2014well\u2014more or less flaunt her in Caroline\u2019s face.",
    "It\nwas I said an unendurable insult.\u201d\nPoirot asked curiously \u201cWhat did he answer\u201d\nMeredith Blake replied with distaste\n\u201cHe said \u2018Caroline must lump it.\u2019\u201d\nHercule Poirot\u2019s eyebrows rose.",
    "\u201cNot\u201d he said \u201ca very sympathetic reply.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cI thought it abominable.",
    "I lost my temper.",
    "I said that no doubt not\ncaring for his wife he didn\u2019t mind how much he made her suffer but\nwhat I said about the girl Hadn\u2019t he realized it was a pretty rotten\nposition for her His reply to that was that Elsa must lump it too\n\u201cThen he went on \u2018You don\u2019t seem to understand Meredith that this\nthing I\u2019m painting is the best thing I\u2019ve done.",
    "It\u2019s good I tell you.",
    "And a\ncouple of jealous quarrelling women aren\u2019t going to upset it\u2014no by\nhell they\u2019re not.\u2019\n\u201cIt was hopeless talking to him.",
    "I said he seemed to have taken leave\nof all ordinary decency.",
    "Painting I said wasn\u2019t everything.",
    "He\ninterrupted there.",
    "He said \u2018Ah but it is to me.\u2019\n\u201cI was still very angry.",
    "I said it was perfectly disgraceful the way he\nhad always treated Caroline.",
    "She had had a miserable life with him.",
    "He\nsaid he knew that and he was sorry about it.",
    "Sorry He said \u2018I know\nMerry you don\u2019t believe that\u2014but it\u2019s the truth.",
    "I\u2019ve given Caroline the\nhell of a life and she\u2019s been a saint about it.",
    "But she did know I think\nwhat she might be letting herself in for.",
    "I told her candidly the sort of\ndamnable egoistic looseliving kind of chap I was.\u2019\n\u201cI put it to him then very strongly that he ought not to break up his\nmarried life.",
    "There was the child to be considered and everything.",
    "I said\nthat I could understand that a girl like Elsa could bowl a man over but\nthat even for her sake he ought to break off the whole thing.",
    "She was\nvery young.",
    "She was going into this baldheaded but she might regret it\nbitterly afterwards.",
    "I said couldn\u2019t he pull himself together make a clean\nbreak and go back to his wife\u201d\n\u201cAnd what did he say\u201d\nBlake said \u201cHe just looked\u2014embarrassed.",
    "He patted me on the\nshoulder and said \u2018You\u2019re a good chap Merry.",
    "But you\u2019re too\nsentimental.",
    "You wait till the picture\u2019s finished and you\u2019ll admit that I\nwas right.\u2019\n\u201cI said \u2018Damn your picture.\u2019 And he grinned and said all the neurotic\nwomen in England couldn\u2019t do that.",
    "Then I said that it would have been\nmore decent to have kept the whole thing from Caroline until after the\npicture was finished.",
    "He said that that wasn\u2019t his fault.",
    "It was Elsa who\nhad insisted on spilling the beans.",
    "I said Why And he said that she had\nhad some idea that it wasn\u2019t straight otherwise.",
    "She wanted everything to\nbe clear and above board.",
    "Well of course in a way one could\n\n\funderstand that and respect the girl for it.",
    "However badly she was\nbehaving she did at least want to be honest.\u201d\n\u201cA lot of additional pain and grief is caused by honesty\u201d remarked\nHercule Poirot.",
    "Meredith Blake looked at him doubtfully.",
    "He did not quite like the\nsentiment.",
    "He sighed\n\u201cIt was a\u2014a most unhappy time for us all.\u201d\n\u201cThe only person who does not seem to have been affected by it was\nAmyas Crale\u201d said Poirot.",
    "\u201cAnd why Because he was a rank egoist.",
    "I remember him now.",
    "Grinning at me as he went off saying \u2018Don\u2019t worry Merry.",
    "Everything\u2019s\ngoing to pan out all right\u2019\u201d\n\u201cThe incurable optimist\u201d murmured Poirot.",
    "Meredith Blake said\n\u201cHe was the kind of man who didn\u2019t take women seriously.",
    "I could\nhave told him that Caroline was desperate.\u201d\n\u201cDid she tell you so\u201d\n\u201cNot in so many words.",
    "But I shall always see her face as it was that\nafternoon.",
    "White and strained with a kind of desperate gaiety.",
    "She talked\nand laughed a lot.",
    "But her eyes\u2014there was a kind of anguished grief in\nthem that was the most moving thing I have ever known.",
    "Such a gentle\ncreature too.\u201d\nHercule Poirot looked at him for a minute or two without speaking.",
    "Clearly the man in front of him felt no incongruity in speaking thus of a\nwoman who on the day after had deliberately killed her husband.",
    "Meredith Blake went on.",
    "He had by now quite overcome his first\nsuspicious hostility.",
    "Hercule Poirot had the gift of listening.",
    "To men such\nas Meredith Blake the reliving of the past has a definite attraction.",
    "He\nspoke now almost more to himself than to his guest.",
    "\u201cI ought to have suspected something I suppose.",
    "It was Caroline who\nturned the conversation to\u2014to my little hobby.",
    "It was I must confess an\nenthusiasm of mine.",
    "The old English herbalists you know are a very\ninteresting study.",
    "There are so many plants that were formerly used in\nmedicine and which have now disappeared from the official\nPharmacop\u0153ia.",
    "And it\u2019s astonishing really how a simple decoction of\nsomething or other will really work wonders.",
    "No need for doctors half\nthe time.",
    "The French understand these things\u2014some of their tisanes are\nfirst rate.\u201d He was well away now on his hobby.",
    "\u201cDandelion tea for instance marvellous stuff.",
    "And a decoction of\nhips\u2014I saw the other day somewhere that that\u2019s coming into fashion\nwith the medical profession again.",
    "Oh yes I must confess I got a lot of\npleasure out of my brews.",
    "Gathering the plants at the right time drying\nthem\u2014macerating them\u2014all the rest of it.",
    "I\u2019ve even dropped to\nsuperstition sometimes and gathered my roots at the full of the moon or\nwhatever it was the ancients advised.",
    "On that day I gave my guests I\nremember a special disquisition on the spotted hemlock.",
    "It flowers\nbiennially.",
    "You gather the fruits when they\u2019re ripening just before they\nturn yellow.",
    "Coniine you know is a drug that\u2019s dropped out\u2014I don\u2019t\nbelieve there\u2019s any official preparation of it in the last Pharmacop\u0153ia\u2014\nbut I\u2019ve proved the usefulness of it in whooping cough\u2014and in asthma\ntoo for that matter\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou talked of all this in your laboratory\u201d\n\u201cYes I showed them round\u2014explained the various drugs to them\u2014\nvalerian and the way it attracts cats\u2014one sniff at that was enough for\nthem Then they asked about deadly nightshade and I told them about\nbelladonna and atropine.",
    "They were very much interested.\u201d\n\u201cThey What is comprised in that word\u201d\nMeredith Blake looked faintly surprised as though he had forgotten\nthat his listener had no firsthand knowledge of the scene.",
    "\u201cOh the whole party.",
    "Let me see Philip was there and Amyas and\nCaroline of course.",
    "Angela.",
    "And Elsa Greer.\u201d\n\u201cThat was all\u201d\n\u201cYes\u2014I think so.",
    "Yes I am sure of it\u201d Blake looked at him curiously.",
    "\u201cWho else should there be\u201d\n\u201cI thought perhaps the governess\u2014\u201d\n\u201cOh I see.",
    "No she wasn\u2019t there that afternoon.",
    "I believe I\u2019ve\nforgotten her name now.",
    "Nice women.",
    "Took her duties very seriously.",
    "Angela worried her a good deal I think.\u201d\n\u201cWhy was that\u201d\n\u201cWell she was a nice kid but she was inclined to run wild.",
    "Always\nup to something or other.",
    "Put a slug or something down Amyas\u2019s back\none day when he was hard at work painting.",
    "He went up in smoke.",
    "Cursed her up and down dale.",
    "It was after that that he insisted on this\nschool idea.\u201d\n\u201cSending her to school\u201d\n\n\f\u201cYes.",
    "I don\u2019t mean he wasn\u2019t fond of her but he found her a bit of a\nnuisance sometimes.",
    "And I think\u2014I\u2019ve always thought\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYes\u201d\n\u201cThat he was a bit jealous.",
    "Caroline you see was a slave to Angela.",
    "In a way perhaps Angela came first with her\u2014and Amyas didn\u2019t like\nthat.",
    "There was a reason for it of course.",
    "I won\u2019t go into that but\u2014\u201d\nPoirot interrupted.",
    "\u201cThe reason being that Caroline Crale reproached herself for an\naction that had disfigured the girl\u201d\nBlake exclaimed \u201cOh you know that I wasn\u2019t going to mention it.",
    "All over and done with.",
    "But yes that was the cause of her attitude I\nthink.",
    "She always seemed to feel that there was nothing too much she\ncould do\u2014to make up as it were.\u201d\nPoirot nodded thoughtfully.",
    "He asked\n\u201cAnd Angela Did she bear a grudge against her half sister\u201d\n\u201cOh no don\u2019t run away with that idea.",
    "Angela was devoted to\nCaroline.",
    "She never gave that old business a thought I\u2019m sure.",
    "It was\njust Caroline who couldn\u2019t forgive herself.\u201d\n\u201cDid Angela take kindly to the idea of boarding school\u201d\n\u201cNo she didn\u2019t.",
    "She was furious with Amyas.",
    "Caroline took her side\nbut Amyas had absolutely made his mind up about it.",
    "In spite of a hot\ntemper Amyas was an easy man in most respects but when he really got\nhis back up everyone had to give in.",
    "Both Caroline and Angela knuckled\nunder.\u201d\n\u201cShe was to go to school\u2014when\u201d\n\u201cThe autumn term\u2014they were getting her kit together I remember.",
    "I\nsuppose if it hadn\u2019t been for the tragedy she would have gone off a few\ndays later.",
    "There was some talk of her packing on the morning of that\nday.\u201d\nPoirot said \u201cAnd the governess\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean\u2014the governess\u201d\n\u201cHow did she like the idea It deprived her of a job did it not\u201d\n\u201cYes\u2014well I suppose it did in a way.",
    "Little Carla used to do a few\nlessons but of course she was only\u2014what Six or thereabouts.",
    "She had a\nnurse.",
    "They wouldn\u2019t have kept Miss Williams on for her.",
    "Yes that\u2019s the\nname\u2014Williams.",
    "Funny how things come back to you when you talk\nthem over.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cYes indeed.",
    "You are back now are you not in the past You relive\nthe scenes\u2014the words that people said their gestures\u2014the expressions\non their faces\u201d\nMeredith Blake said slowly\n\u201cIn a way\u2014yes\u2026But there are gaps you know\u2026Great chunks\nmissed out.",
    "I remember for instance the shock it was to me when I first\nlearned that Amyas was going to leave Caroline\u2014but I can\u2019t remember\nwhether it was he who told me or Elsa.",
    "I do remember arguing with Elsa\non the subject\u2014trying to show her I mean that it was a pretty rotten\nthing to do.",
    "And she only laughed at me in that cool way of hers and said\nI was old fashioned.",
    "Well I dare say I am old fashioned but I still think I\nwas right.",
    "Amyas had a wife and child\u2014he ought to have stuck to them.\u201d\n\u201cBut Miss Greer thought that point of view out of date\u201d\n\u201cYes.",
    "Mind you sixteen years ago divorce wasn\u2019t looked on quite so\nmuch as a matter of course as it is now.",
    "But Elsa was the kind of girl who\nwent in for being modern.",
    "Her point of view was that when two people\nweren\u2019t happy together it was better to make a break.",
    "She said that\nAmyas and Caroline never stopped having rows and that it was far better\nfor the child that she shouldn\u2019t be brought up in an atmosphere of\ndisharmony.\u201d\n\u201cAnd her argument did not impress you\u201d\nMeredith Blake said slowly\n\u201cI felt all the time that she didn\u2019t really know what she was talking\nabout.",
    "She was rattling these things off\u2014things she\u2019d read in books or\nheard from her friends\u2014it was like a parrot.",
    "She was\u2014it\u2019s a queer thing\nto say\u2014pathetic somehow.",
    "So young and so selfconfident.\u201d He paused.",
    "\u201cThere is something about youth Mr. Poirot that is\u2014that can be\u2014\nterribly moving.\u201d\nHercule Poirot said looking at him with some interest \u201cI know what\nyou mean\u2026.\u201d\nBlake went on speaking more to himself than to Poirot.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s partly I think why I tackled Crale.",
    "He was nearly twenty\nyears older than the girl.",
    "It didn\u2019t seem fair.\u201d\nPoirot murmured\n\u201cAlas\u2014how seldom one makes any effect.",
    "When a person has\ndetermined on a certain course\u2014it is not easy to turn them from it.\u201d\nMeredith Blake said\n\n\f\u201cThat is true enough.\u201d His tone was a shade bitter.",
    "\u201cI certainly did no\ngood by my interference.",
    "But then I am not a very convincing person.",
    "I\nnever have been.\u201d\nPoirot threw him a quick glance.",
    "He read into that slight acerbity of\ntone the dissatisfaction of a sensitive man with his own lack of\npersonality.",
    "And he acknowledged to himself the truth of what Blake had\njust said.",
    "Meredith Blake was not the man to persuade anyone into or out\nof any course.",
    "His wellmeaning attempts would always be set aside\u2014\nindulgently usually without anger but definitely set aside.",
    "They would\nnot carry weight.",
    "He was essentially an ineffective man.",
    "Poirot said with an appearance of changing a painful subject \u201cYou\nstill have your laboratory of medicines and cordials yes\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\nThe word came sharply\u2014with an almost anguished rapidity Meridith\nBlake said his face flushing\n\u201cI abandoned the whole thing\u2014dismantled it.",
    "I couldn\u2019t go on with it\n\u2014how could I\u2014after what had happened.",
    "The whole thing you see\nmight have been said to be my fault.\u201d\n\u201cNo no Mr. Blake you are too sensitive.\u201d\n\u201cBut don\u2019t you see If I hadn\u2019t collected those damned drugs If I\nhadn\u2019t laid stress on them\u2014boasted about them\u2014forced them on those\npeople\u2019s notice that afternoon But I never thought\u2014I never dreamed\u2014\nhow could I\u2014\u201d\n\u201cHow indeed.\u201d\n\u201cBut I went bumbling on about them.",
    "Pleased with my little bit of\nknowledge.",
    "Blind conceited fool.",
    "I pointed out that damned coniine.",
    "I\neven fool that I was took them back into the library and read them out\nthat passage from the Phaedo describing Socrates\u2019 death.",
    "A beautiful\npiece of writing\u2014I\u2019ve always admired it.",
    "But it\u2019s haunted me ever\nsince.\u201d\nPoirot said\n\u201cDid they find any fingerprints on the coniine bottle\u201d\n\u201cHers.\u201d\n\u201cCaroline Crale\u2019s\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cNot yours\u201d\n\u201cNo.",
    "I didn\u2019t handle the bottle you see.",
    "Only pointed to it.\u201d\n\u201cBut at the same time surely you had handled it\u201d\n\n\f\u201cOh of course but I gave the bottles a periodic dusting from time to\ntime\u2014I never allowed the servants in there of course\u2014and I had done\nthat about four or five days previously.\u201d\n\u201cYou kept the room locked up\u201d\n\u201cInvariably.\u201d\n\u201cWhen did Caroline Crale take the coniine from the bottle\u201d\nMeredith Blake replied reluctantly\n\u201cShe was the last to leave the room.",
    "I called her I remember and she\ncame hurrying out.",
    "Her cheeks were just a little pink\u2014and her eyes wide\nand excited.",
    "Oh God I can see her now.\u201d\nPoirot said \u201cDid you have any conversation with her at all that\nafternoon I mean by that did you discuss the situation as between her\nand her husband at all\u201d\nBlake said slowly in a low voice\n\u201cNot directly.",
    "She was looking as I\u2019ve told you\u2014very upset.",
    "I said to\nher at a moment when we were more or less by ourselves \u2018Is anything\nthe matter my dear\u2019 she said \u2018Everything\u2019s the matter\u2026\u2019 I wish you\ncould have heard the desperation in her voice.",
    "Those words were the\nabsolute literal truth.",
    "There\u2019s no getting away from it\u2014Amyas Crale was\nCaroline\u2019s whole world.",
    "She said \u2018Everything\u2019s gone\u2014finished.",
    "I\u2019m\nfinished Meredith.\u2019 And then she laughed and turned to the others and\nwas suddenly wildly and very unnaturally gay.\u201d\nHercule Poirot nodded his head slowly.",
    "He looked very like a china\nmandarin.",
    "He said\n\u201cYes\u2014I see\u2014it was like that\u2026.\u201d\nMeredith Blake pounded suddenly with his fist.",
    "His voice rose.",
    "It was\nalmost a shout.",
    "\u201cAnd I\u2019ll tell you this Mr. Poirot\u2014when Caroline Crale said at the\ntrial that she took the stuff for herself I\u2019ll swear she was speaking the\ntruth There was no thought in her mind of murder at that time.",
    "I swear\nthere wasn\u2019t.",
    "That came later.\u201d\nHercule Poirot asked\n\u201cAre you sure that it did come later\u201d\nBlake stared.",
    "He said\n\u201cI beg your pardon I don\u2019t quite understand\u2014\u201d\nPoirot said\n\u201cI ask you whether you are sure that the thought of murder ever did\ncome Are you perfectly convinced in your own mind that Caroline\n\n\fCrale did deliberately commit murder\u201d\nMeredith Blake\u2019s breath came unevenly.",
    "He said \u201cBut if not\u2014if not\n\u2014are you suggesting an\u2014well accident of some kind\u201d\n\u201cNot necessarily.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s a very extraordinary thing to say.\u201d\n\u201cIs it You have called Caroline Crale a gentle creature.",
    "Do gentle\ncreatures commit murder\u201d\n\u201cShe was a gentle creature\u2014but all the same\u2014well there were very\nviolent quarrels you know.\u201d\n\u201cNot such a gentle creature then\u201d\n\u201cBut she was\u2014Oh how difficult these things are to explain.\u201d\n\u201cI am trying to understand.\u201d\n\u201cCaroline had a quick tongue\u2014a vehement way of speaking.",
    "She\nmight say \u2018I hate you.",
    "I wish you were dead.\u2019 But it wouldn\u2019t mean\u2014it\nwouldn\u2019t entail\u2014action.\u201d\n\u201cSo in your opinion it was highly uncharacteristic of Mrs. Crale to\ncommit murder\u201d\n\u201cYou have the most extraordinary ways of putting things Mr. Poirot.",
    "I can only say that\u2014yes\u2014it does seem to me uncharacteristic of her.",
    "I\ncan only explain it by realizing that the provocation was extreme.",
    "She\nadored her husband.",
    "Under those circumstances a woman might\u2014well\u2014\nkill.\u201d\nPoirot nodded.",
    "\u201cYes I agree\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cI was dumbfounded at first.",

    "It interests me to examine the possibility.",

    "But\u2014well\u2014cause and\neffect you know.\u201d\nHercule Poirot said\n\u201cHave you ever reflected Mr. Blake that the reason for murder is\nnearly always to be found by a study of the person murdered\u201d\n\u201cI hadn\u2019t exactly\u2014yes I suppose I see what you mean.\u201d\nPoirot said\n\u201cUntil you know exactly what sort of a person the victim was you\ncannot begin to see the circumstances of a crime clearly.\u201d\nHe added\n\u201cThat is what I am seeking for\u2014and what you and your brother have\nhelped to give me\u2014a reconstruction of the man Amyas Crale.\u201d\nMeredith Blake passed the main point of the remark over.",

    "His attitude wasn\u2019t\nreally easy to define.",
    "He was annoyed I think with Amyas for making a\nfool of himself over the girl.",

    "At the same time I have a\nfeeling\u2014yes very definitely I have a feeling that he was just faintly\npleased at seeing Caroline let down.\u201d\nPoirot\u2019s eyebrows rose.",
    "He said\n\u201cHe really felt like that\u201d\n\u201cOh don\u2019t misunderstand me.",
    "I wouldn\u2019t go further than to say that I\nbelieve that feeling was at the back of his mind.",

    "He said\u2014and his voice sounded utterly\nincredulous\n\u201cCaroline wrote that\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\nPoirot paused and said\n\u201cIt surprises you\u201d\n\u201cIt would surprise you if you\u2019d seen her in court.",
    "Poor hunted\ndefenceless creature.",
    "Not even struggling.\u201d\n\u201cA defeatist\u201d\n\u201cNo no.",
    "She wasn\u2019t that.",

    "\u201cThat\u2019s not\u2014that\u2019s not like\nCaroline\u2026.\u201d\nHercule Poirot nodded.",
    "Carla Lemarchant had said that.",
    "Carla had\nonly a child\u2019s obstinate memory.",
    "But Meredith Blake had known\nCaroline well.",
    "It was the first confirmation Poirot had got that Carla\u2019s\nbelief was to be depended upon.",

    "\u201cAnd you What do you think\u201d\nThere was a silence.",
    "\u201cAs yet\u201d said Poirot at last \u201cI think nothing.",

    "To go over the\nfacts laboriously one by one.",
    "Your brother is going to help me there.",
    "He\nis sending me an account of the events as he remembers them.\u201d\nMeredith Blake said sharply\n\u201cYou won\u2019t get much from that.",
    "Philip\u2019s a busy man.",
    "Things slip his\nmemory once they\u2019re past and done with.",
    "Probably he\u2019ll remember\nthings all wrong.\u201d\n\u201cThere will be gaps of course.",
    "I realize that.\u201d\n\u201cI tell you what\u2014\u201d Meredith paused abruptly then went on\nreddening a little as he spoke.",
    "\u201cIf you like I\u2014I could do the same.",
    "I\nmean it would be a kind of check wouldn\u2019t it\u201d\nHercule Poirot said warmly\n\u201cIt would be most valuable.",
    "An idea of the first excellence\u201d\n\u201cRight.",
    "I will.",
    "I\u2019ve got some old diaries somewhere.",
    "Mind you\u201d he\nlaughed awkwardly.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m not much of a hand at literary language.",

    "You\u2014you won\u2019t expect too much\u201d\n\u201cAh it is not the style I demand.",
    "Just a plain recital of everything you\ncan remember.",
    "What every one said how they looked\u2014just what\nhappened.",
    "Never mind if it doesn\u2019t seem relevant.",
    "It all helps with the\natmosphere so to speak.\u201d\n\u201cYes I can see that.",
    "It must be difficult visualizing people and places\nyou have never seen.\u201d\nPoirot nodded.",
    "\u201cThere is another thing I wanted to ask you.",
    "Alderbury is the\nadjoining property to this is it not Would it be possible to go there\u2014to\nsee with my own eyes where the tragedy occurred\u201d\nMeredith Blake said slowly\n\u201cI can take you over there right away.",
    "But of course it is a good deal\nchanged.\u201d\n\u201cIt has not been built over\u201d\n\u201cNo thank goodness\u2014not quite so bad as that.",
    "But it\u2019s a kind of\nhostel now\u2014it was bought by some society.",
    "Hordes of young people\ncome down to it in the summer and of course all the rooms have been\ncut up and partitioned into cubicles and the grounds have been altered a\ngood deal.\u201d\n\u201cYou must reconstruct it for me by your explanations.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll do my best.",
    "I wish you could have seen it in the old days.",
    "It was\none of the loveliest properties I know.\u201d\n\n\fHe led the way out through the window and began walking down a\nslope of lawn.",
    "\u201cWho was responsible for selling it\u201d\n\u201cThe executors on behalf of the child.",
    "Everything Crale had came to\nher.",
    "He hadn\u2019t made a will so I imagine that it would be divided\nautomatically between his wife and the child.",
    "Caroline\u2019s will left what\nshe had to the child also.\u201d\n\u201cNothing to her half sister\u201d\n\u201cAngela had a certain amount of money of her own left her by her\nfather.\u201d\nPoirot nodded.",
    "\u201cI see.\u201d\nThen he uttered an exclamation\n\u201cBut where is it that you take me This is the seashore ahead of us\u201d\n\u201cAh I must explain our geography to you.",
    "You\u2019ll see for yourself in a\nminute.",
    "There\u2019s a creek you see Camel Creek they call it runs inland\u2014\nlooks almost like a river mouth but it isn\u2019t\u2014it\u2019s just sea.",
    "To get to\nAlderbury by land you have to go right inland and round the creek but\nthe shortest way from one house to the other is to row across this narrow\nbit of the creek.",
    "Alderbury is just opposite\u2014there you can see the house\nthrough the trees.\u201d\nThey had come out on a little beach.",
    "Opposite them was a wooded\nheadland and a white house could just be distinguished high up amongst\nthe trees.",
    "Two boats were drawn up on the beach.",
    "Meredith Blake with Poirot\u2019s\nsomewhat awkward assistance dragged one of them down to the water\nand presently they were rowing across to the other side.",
    "\u201cWe always went this way in the old days\u201d Meredith explained.",
    "\u201cUnless of course there was a storm or it was raining and then we\u2019d\ntake the car.",
    "But it\u2019s nearly three miles if you go round that way.\u201d\nHe ran the boat neatly alongside a stone quay on the other side.",
    "He\ncast a disparaging eye on a collection of wooden huts and some concrete\nterraces.",
    "\u201cAll new this.",
    "Used to be a boathouse\u2014tumbledown old place\u2014and\nnothing else.",
    "And one walked along the shore and bathed off those rocks\nover there.\u201d\nHe assisted his guest to alight made fast the boat and led the way up\na steep path.",
    "\u201cDon\u2019t suppose we\u2019ll meet anyone\u201d he said over his shoulder.",
    "\u201cNobody here in April\u2014except for Easter.",
    "Doesn\u2019t matter if we do.",
    "I\u2019m\non good terms with my neighbours.",
    "Sun\u2019s glorious today.",
    "Might be\nsummer.",
    "It was a wonderful day then.",
    "More like July than September.",
    "Brilliant sun\u2014but a chilly little wind.\u201d\nThe path came out of the trees and skirted an outcrop of rock.",
    "Meredith pointed up with his hand.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s what they called the Battery.",
    "We\u2019re more or less underneath it\nnow\u2014skirting round it.\u201d\nThey plunged into trees again and then the path took another sharp\nturn and they emerged by a door set in a high wall.",
    "The path itself\ncontinued to zigzag upwards but Meredith opened the door and the two\nmen passed through it.",
    "For a moment Poirot was dazzled coming in from the shade outside.",
    "The Battery was an artificially cleared plateau with battlements set with\ncannon.",
    "It gave one the impression of overhanging the sea.",
    "There were\ntrees above it and behind it but on the sea side there was nothing but the\ndazzling blue water below.",
    "\u201cAttractive spot\u201d said Meredith.",
    "He nodded contemptuously towards\na kind of pavilion set back against the back wall.",
    "\u201cThat wasn\u2019t there of\ncourse\u2014only an old tumbledown shed where Amyas kept his painting\nmuck and some bottled beer and a few deck chairs.",
    "It wasn\u2019t concreted\nthen either.",
    "There used to be a bench and a table\u2014painted iron ones.",
    "That was all.",
    "Still\u2014it hasn\u2019t changed much.\u201d\nHis voice held an unsteady note.",
    "Poirot said \u201cAnd it was here that it happened\u201d\nMeredith nodded.",
    "\u201cThe bench was there\u2014up against the shed.",
    "He was sprawled on that.",
    "He used to sprawl there sometimes when he was painting\u2014just fling\nhimself down and stare and stare\u2014and then suddenly up he\u2019d jump and\nstart laying the paint on the canvas like mad.\u201d\nHe paused.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s why you know he looked\u2014almost natural.",
    "As though he\nmight be asleep\u2014just have dropped off.",
    "But his eyes were open\u2014and\nhe\u2019d\u2014just stiffened up.",
    "Stuff sort of paralyses you you know.",
    "There\nisn\u2019t any pain\u2026I\u2019ve\u2014I\u2019ve always been glad of that\u2026.\u201d\nPoirot asked a thing that he already knew.",
    "\u201cWho found him\u201d\n\n\f\u201cShe did.",
    "Caroline.",
    "After lunch.",
    "I and Elsa I suppose were the last\nones to see him alive.",
    "It must have been coming on then.",
    "He\u2014looked\nqueer.",
    "I\u2019d rather not talk about it.",
    "I\u2019ll write it to you.",
    "Easier that way.\u201d\nHe turned abruptly and went out of the Battery.",
    "Poirot followed him\nwithout speaking.",
    "The two men went on up the zigzag path.",
    "At a higher level than the\nBattery there was another small plateau.",
    "It was overshadowed with trees\nand there was a bench there and a table.",
    "Meredith said\n\u201cThey haven\u2019t changed this much.",
    "But the bench used not to be Ye\nOlde Rustic.",
    "It was just a painted iron business.",
    "A bit hard for sitting but\na lovely view.\u201d\nPoirot agreed.",
    "Through a framework of trees one looked down over\nthe Battery to the creek mouth.",
    "\u201cI sat up here part of the morning\u201d Meredith explained.",
    "\u201cTrees\nweren\u2019t quite so overgrown then.",
    "One could see the battlements of the\nBattery quite plainly.",
    "That\u2019s where Elsa was posing you know.",
    "Sitting on\none with her head twisted round.\u201d\nHe gave a slight twitch of his shoulders.",
    "\u201cTrees grow faster than one thinks\u201d he muttered.",
    "\u201cOh well suppose\nI\u2019m getting old.",
    "Come on up to the house.\u201d\nThey continued to follow the path till it emerged near the house.",
    "It\nhad been a fine old house Georgian in style.",
    "It had been added to and on\na green lawn near it were set some fifty little wooden bathing hutches.",
    "\u201cYoung men sleep there girls in the house\u201d Meredith explained.",
    "\u201cI\ndon\u2019t suppose there\u2019s anything you want to see here.",
    "All the rooms have\nbeen cut about.",
    "Used to be a little conservatory tacked on here.",
    "These\npeople have built a loggia.",
    "Oh well\u2014I suppose they enjoy their holidays.",
    "Can\u2019t keep everything as it used to be\u2014more\u2019s the pity.\u201d\nHe turned away abruptly.",
    "\u201cWe\u2019ll go down another way.",
    "It\u2014it all comes back to me you know.",
    "Ghosts.",
    "Ghosts everywhere.\u201d\nThey returned to the quay by a somewhat longer and more rambling\nroute.",
    "Neither of them spoke.",
    "Poirot respected his companion\u2019s mood.",
    "When they reached Handcross Manor once more Meredith Blake\nsaid abruptly\n\u201cI bought that picture you know.",
    "The one that Amyas was painting.",
    "I\njust couldn\u2019t stand the idea of its being sold for\u2014well\u2014publicity value\n\n\f\u2014a lot of dirtyminded brutes gaping at it.",
    "It was a fine piece of work.",
    "Amyas said it was the best thing he\u2019d ever done.",
    "I shouldn\u2019t be surprised\nif he was right.",
    "It was practically finished.",
    "He only wanted to work on it\nanother day or so.",
    "Would\u2014would you care to see it\u201d\nHercule Poirot said quickly \u201cYes indeed.\u201d\nBlake led the way across the hall and took a key from his pocket.",
    "He\nunlocked a door and they went into a fairsized dusty smelling room.",
    "It\nwas closely shuttered.",
    "Blake went across to the windows and opened the\nwooden shutters.",
    "Then with a little difficulty he flung up a window and\na breath of fragrant spring air came wafting into the room.",
    "Meredith said \u201cThat\u2019s better.\u201d\nHe stood by the window inhaling the air and Poirot joined him.",
    "There\nwas no need to ask what the room had been.",
    "The shelves were empty but\nthere were marks upon them where bottles had stood.",
    "Against one wall\nwas some derelict chemical apparatus and a sink.",
    "The room was thick in\ndust.",
    "Meredith Blake was looking out of the window.",
    "He said\n\u201cHow easily it all comes back.",
    "Standing here smelling the jasmine\u2014\nand talking\u2014talking\u2014like the damned fool I was\u2014about my precious\npotions and distillations\u201d\nAbsently Poirot stretched a hand through the window.",
    "He pulled off a\nspray of jasmine leaves just breaking from their woody stem.",
    "Meredith Blake moved resolutely across the floor.",
    "On the wall was a\npicture covered with a dust sheet.",
    "He jerked the dust sheet away.",
    "Poirot caught his breath.",
    "He had seen so far four pictures of Amyas\nCrale\u2019s two at the Tate one at a London dealer\u2019s one the still life of\nroses.",
    "But now he was looking at what the artist himself had called his\nbest picture and Poirot realized at once what a superb artist the man had\nbeen.",
    "The painting had an old superficial smoothness.",
    "At first sight it might\nhave been a poster so seemingly crude were its contrasts.",
    "A girl a girl in\na canaryyellow shirt and darkblue slacks sitting on a grey wall in full\nsunlight against a background of violent blue sea.",
    "Just the kind of subject\nfor a poster.",
    "But the first appearance was deceptive there was a subtle distortion\n\u2014an amazing brilliance and clarity in the light.",
    "And the girl\u2014\nYes here was life.",
    "All there was all there could be of life of youth\nof sheer blazing vitality.",
    "The face was alive and the eyes\u2026.",
    "So much life Such passionate youth That then was what Amyas\nCrale had seen in Elsa Greer which had made him blind and deaf to the\ngentle creature his wife.",
    "Elsa was life.",
    "Elsa was youth.",
    "A superb slim straight creature arrogant her head turned her eyes\ninsolent with triumph.",
    "Looking at you watching you\u2014waiting\u2026.",
    "Hercule Poirot spread out his hands.",
    "He said\n\u201cIt is a great\u2014yes it is great\u2014\u201d\nMeredith Blake said a catch in his voice\n\u201cShe was so young\u2014\u201d\nPoirot nodded.",
    "He thought to himself.",
    "\u201cWhat do most people mean when they say that So young.",
    "Something innocent something appealing something helpless.",
    "But\nyouth is not that Youth is crude youth is strong youth is powerful\u2014\nyes and cruel And one thing more\u2014youth is vulnerable.\u201d\nHe followed his host to the door.",
    "His interest was quickened now in\nElsa Greer whom he was to visit next.",
    "What would the years have done\nto that passionate triumphant crude child\nHe looked back at the picture.",

    "She might lie from necessity but\nnever from choice.",
    "Elsa Dittisham said slowly\n\u201cNo not painful.",
    "In a way I wish it were.\u201d\n\u201cWhy\u201d\nShe said impatiently\n\u201cIt\u2019s so stupid never to feel anything\u2026.\u201d\nAnd Hercule Poirot thought\n\u201cYes Elsa Greer is dead\u2026.\u201d\nAloud he said\n\u201cAt all events Lady Dittisham it makes my task very much easier.\u201d\nShe said cheerfully\n\u201cWhat do you want to know\u201d\n\u201cHave you a good memory madame\u201d\n\u201cReasonably good I think.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you are sure it will not pain you to go over those days in\ndetail\u201d\n\u201cIt won\u2019t pain me at all.",

    "He\u2019s a devil if you like.",
    "I enjoyed fighting him.",

    "But in this case his decision was quickly made.",

    "With an only child that is particularly the case and of\ncourse mothers are the worst offenders.",
    "The result on the marriage is\noften unfortunate.",
    "The husband resents coming second seeks consolation\n\u2014or rather flattery and attention\u2014elsewhere and a divorce results\nsooner or later.",
    "The best thing for a child I am convinced is to have\nwhat I should term healthy neglect on the part of both its parents.",
    "This\nhappens naturally enough in the case of a large family of children and\nvery little money.",

    "One does occasionally find a husband\nand wife who are so allsufficient to each other so wrapped up in each\nother that the child of the marriage hardly seems very real to either of\nthem.",
    "And in those circumstances I think a child comes to resent that\nfact to feel defrauded and left out in the cold.",
    "You understand that I am\nnot speaking of neglect in any way.",
    "Mrs. Crale for instance was what is\ntermed an excellent mother always careful of Carla\u2019s welfare of her\nhealth\u2014playing with her at the right times and always kind and gay.",
    "But\nfor all that Mrs. Crale was really completely wrapped up in her husband.",

    "You must have resented that\ndecision.\u201d\n\u201cNot at all Mr. Poirot.",
    "I thoroughly concurred with it.\u201d\nShe paused and went\n\u201cLet me make the matter clear to you.",
    "Angela was a dear girl\u2014really\na very dear girl\u2014warmhearted and impulsive\u2014but she was also what I\ncall a difficult girl.",
    "That is she was at a difficult age.",
    "There is always a\nmoment where a girl feels unsure of herself\u2014neither child nor woman.",
    "At one minute Angela would be sensible and mature\u2014quite grown up in\nfact\u2014but a minute later she would relapse into being a hoydenish child\n\u2014playing mischievous tricks and being rude and losing her temper.",
    "Girls you know feel difficult at that age\u2014they are terribly sensitive.",
    "Everything that is said to them they resent.",
    "They are annoyed at being\ntreated like a child and then they suddenly feel shy at being treated like\nadults.",
    "Angela was in that state.",
    "She had fits of temper would suddenly\nresent teasing and flare out\u2014and then she would be sulky for days at a\ntime sitting about and frowning\u2014then again she would be in wild\nspirits climbing trees rushing about with the garden boys refusing to\nsubmit to any kind of authority.\u201d\nMiss Williams paused and went on\n\u201cWhen a girl gets to that stage school is very helpful.",
    "She needs the\nstimulation of other minds\u2014that and the wholesome discipline of a\ncommunity help her to become a reasonable member of society.",
    "Angela\u2019s home conditions were not what I would have called ideal.",
    "Mrs.\nCrale spoiled her for one thing.",
    "Angela had only to appeal to her and\nMrs. Crale always backed her up.",
    "The result was that Angela considered\nshe had first claim upon her sister\u2019s time and attention and it was in\nthese moods of hers that she used to clash with Mr. Crale.",
    "Mr. Crale\nnaturally thought that he should come first\u2014and intended to do so.",
    "He\nwas really very fond of the girl\u2014they were good companions and used\nto spar together quite amiably but there were times when Mr. Crale used\n\n\fsuddenly to resent Mrs. Crale\u2019s preoccupation with Angela.",
    "Like all men\nhe was a spoilt child he expected everybody to make a fuss of him.",
    "Then\nhe and Angela used to have a real setto\u2014and very often Mrs. Crale\nwould take Angela\u2019s side.",
    "Then he would be furious.",
    "On the other hand\nif she supported him Angela would be furious.",
    "It was on these occasions\nthat Angela used to revert to childish ways and play some spiteful trick\non him.",
    "He had a habit of tossing off his drinks and she once put a lot of\nsalt into his drink.",
    "The whole thing of course acted as an emetic and he\nwas inarticulate with fury.",

    "He had a queer aversion for\nslugs.",
    "He lost his temper completely and said that the girl had got to be\nsent away to school.",
    "He wasn\u2019t going to put up with all this petty\nnonsense any more.",
    "Angela was terribly upset\u2014though actually she had\nonce or twice expressed a wish herself to go to a boarding school\u2014but\nshe chose to make a huge grievance of it.",
    "Mrs. Crale didn\u2019t want her to\ngo but allowed herself to be persuaded\u2014largely owing I think to what I\nsaid to her on the subject.",
    "I pointed out to her that it would be greatly to\nAngela\u2019s advantage and that I thought it would really be a great benefit\nto the girl.",
    "So it was settled that she should go to Helston\u2014a very fine\nschool on the south coast\u2014in the autumn term.",
    "But Mrs. Crale was still\nunhappy about it all those holidays.",
    "And Angela kept up a grudge against\nMr. Crale whenever she remembered.",
    "It wasn\u2019t really serious you\nunderstand Mr. Poirot but it made a kind of undercurrent that summer\nto\u2014well\u2014to everything else that was going on.\u201d\nPoirot said \u201cMeaning\u2014Elsa Greer\u201d\nMiss Williams said sharply\n\u201cExactly.\u201d And shut her lips very tight after the word.",

    "A thoroughly unprincipled young\nwoman.\u201d\n\u201cShe was very young.\u201d\n\u201cOld enough to know better.",
    "I can see no excuse for her\u2014none at\nall.\u201d\n\u201cShe fell in love with him I suppose\u2014\u201d\nMiss Williams interrupted with a snort.",
    "\u201cFell in love with him indeed.",
    "I should hope Mr. Poirot that\nwhatever our feelings we can keep them in decent control.",
    "And we can\ncertainly control our actions.",
    "That girl had absolutely no morals of any\n\n\fkind.",
    "It meant nothing to her that Mr. Crale was a married man.",
    "She was\nabsolutely shameless about it all\u2014cool and determined.",
    "Possibly she\nmay have been badly brought up\u2014but that\u2019s the only excuse I can find\nfor her.\u201d\n\u201cMr.",
    "Crale\u2019s death must have been a terrible shock to her.\u201d\n\u201cOh it was.",
    "And she herself was entirely to blame for it.",
    "I don\u2019t go as\nfar as condoning murder but all the same Mr. Poirot if ever a woman\nwas driven to breaking point that woman was Caroline Crale.",
    "I tell you\nfrankly there were moments when I would have liked to murder them\nboth myself.",

    "No man should treat his wife as\nhe did and not be punished for it.",
    "His death was a just retribution.\u201d\nHercule Poirot said \u201cYou feel strongly\u2026.\u201d\nThe small woman looked at him with those indomitable grey eyes.",

    "\u201cOh yes I know.",
    "That\u2019s always the excuse nowadays.",
    "An artist An\nexcuse for every kind of loose living for drunkenness for brawling for\ninfidelity.",

    "Miss Williams sniffed.",
    "\u201cPossibly.",
    "So is one of Mr. Epstein\u2019s statues I believe.\u201d\n\n\fPoirot perceived that according to Miss Williams the last word had\nbeen said.",

    "\u201cAnd what did you say to that\u201d\n\u201cReally Mr. Poirot does it matter what I said\u201d\n\u201cYes I think it does.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t see why\u2014\u201d\nBut as though his expectant silence hypnotized her she said\nreluctantly\n\u201cI think I said \u2018Certainly Mrs. Crale.",
    "It must have been suicide.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cDid you believe your own words\u201d\nMiss Williams raised her head.",
    "She said firmly\n\u201cNo I did not.",
    "But please understand Mr. Poirot that I was entirely\non Mrs. Crale\u2019s side if you like to put it that way.",
    "My sympathies were\nwith her not with the police.\u201d\n\u201cYou would have liked to have seen her acquitted\u201d\nMiss Williams said defiantly\n\u201cYes I would.\u201d\nPoirot said\n\u201cThen you are in sympathy with her daughter\u2019s feelings\u201d\n\u201cI have every sympathy with Carla.\u201d\n\u201cWould you have any objection to writing out for me a detailed\naccount of the tragedy\u201d\n\u201cYou mean for her to read\u201d\n\n\f\u201cYes.\u201d\nMiss Williams said slowly\n\u201cNo I have no objection.",
    "She is quite determined to go into the\nmatter is she\u201d\n\u201cYes.",
    "I dare say it would have been preferable if the truth had been\nkept from her\u2014\u201d\nMiss Williams interrupted him\n\u201cNo.",
    "It is always better to face the truth.",
    "It is no use evading\nunhappiness by tampering with facts.",
    "Carla has had a shock learning the\ntruth\u2014now she wants to know exactly how the tragedy came about.",
    "That\nseems to me the right attitude for a brave young woman to take.",
    "Once\nshe knows all about it she will be able to forget it again and go on with\nthe business of living her own life.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps you are right\u201d said Poirot.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m quite sure I\u2019m right.\u201d\n\u201cBut you see there is more to it than that.",
    "She not only wants to know\n\u2014she wants to prove her mother innocent.\u201d\nMiss Williams said \u201cPoor child.\u201d\n\u201cThat is what you say is it\u201d\nMiss Williams said\n\u201cI see now why you said that it might be better if she had never\nknown.",
    "All the same I think it is best as it is.",
    "To wish to find her mother\ninnocent is a natural hope\u2014and hard though the actual revelation may\nbe I think from what you say of her that Carla is brave enough to learn\nthe truth and not flinch from it.\u201d\n\u201cYou are sure it is the truth\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand you\u201d\n\u201cYou see no loophole for believing that Mrs. Crale was innocent\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that possibility has ever been seriously considered.\u201d\n\u201cAnd yet she herself clung to the theory of suicide\u201d\nMiss Williams said drily\n\u201cThe poor woman had to say something.\u201d\n\u201cDo you know that when Mrs. Crale was dying she left a letter for her\ndaughter in which she solemnly swears that she is innocent\u201d\nMiss Williams stared.",
    "\u201cThat was very wrong of her\u201d she said sharply.",
    "\u201cYou think so\u201d\n\u201cYes I do.",
    "Oh I dare say you are a sentimentalist like most men\u2014\u201d\n\n\fPoirot interrupted indignantly\n\u201cI am not a sentimentalist.\u201d\n\u201cBut there is such a thing as false sentiment.",
    "Why write that a lie at\nsuch a solemn moment To spare your child pain Yes many women\nwould do that.",
    "But I should not have thought it of Mrs. Crale.",
    "She was a\nbrave woman and a truthful woman.",
    "I should have thought it far more\nlike her to have told her daughter not to judge.\u201d\nPoirot said with slight exasperation\n\u201cYou will not even consider then the possibility that what Caroline\nCrale wrote was the truth\u201d\n\u201cCertainly not\u201d\n\u201cAnd yet you profess to have loved her\u201d\n\u201cI did love her.",
    "I had a great affection and deep sympathy for her.\u201d\n\u201cWell then\u2014\u201d\nMiss Williams looked at him in a very odd way.",
    "\u201cYou don\u2019t understand Mr. Poirot.",
    "It doesn\u2019t matter my saying this\nnow\u2014so long afterwards.",
    "You see I happen to know that Caroline Crale\nwas guilty\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s true.",
    "Whether I did right in withholding what I knew at the time I\ncannot be sure\u2014but I did withhold it.",
    "But you must take it from me\nquite definitely that I know Caroline Crale was guilty\u2026.\u201d\n\n\f\fTen\nTHIS LITTLE PIG CRIED \u201cWEE WEE WEE\u201d\n\nAngela Warren\u2019s flat overlooked Regent\u2019s Park.",
    "Here on this spring\nday a soft air wafted in through the open window and one might have\nhad the illusion that one was in the country if it had not been for the\nsteady menacing roar of the traffic passing below.",
    "Poirot turned from the window as the door opened and Angela\nWarren came into the room.",
    "It was not the first time he had seen her.",
    "He had availed himself of the\nopportunity to attend a lecture she had given at the Royal Geographical.",
    "It had been he considered an excellent lecture.",
    "Dry perhaps from the\nview of popular appeal.",
    "Miss Warren had an excellent delivery she\nneither paused nor hesitated for a word.",
    "She did not repeat herself.",
    "The\ntones of her voice were clear and not unmelodious.",
    "She made no\nconcessions to romantic appeal or love of adventure.",
    "There was very\nlittle human interest in the lecture.",
    "It was an admirable recital of concise\nfacts adequately illustrated by excellent slides and with intelligent\ndeductions from the facts recited.",
    "Dry precise clear lucid highly\ntechnical.",
    "The soul of Hercule Poirot approved.",
    "Here he considered was an\norderly mind.",
    "Now that he saw her at close quarters he realized that Angela Warren\nmight easily have been a very handsome woman.",
    "Her features were\nregular though severe.",
    "She had finely marked dark brows clear\nintelligent brown eyes a fine pale skin.",
    "She had very square shoulders\nand a slightly mannish walk.",
    "There was certainly about her no suggestion of the little pig who cries\n\u201cWee Wee.\u201d But on the right cheek disfiguring and puckering the skin\nwas that healed scar.",
    "The right eye was slightly distorted the corner\npulled downwards by it but no one would have realized that the sight of\nthat eye was destroyed.",
    "It seemed to Hercule Poirot almost certain that\nshe had lived with her disability so long that she was now completely\nunconscious of it.",
    "And it occurred to him that of the five people in whom\nhe had become interested as a result of his investigations those who\nmight have been said to start with the fullest advantages were not those\n\n\fwho had actually wrested the most success and happiness from life.",
    "Elsa\nwho might have been said to start with all advantages\u2014youth beauty\nriches\u2014had done worst.",
    "She was like a flower overtaken by untimely\nfrost\u2014still in bud\u2014but without life.",
    "Cecilia Williams to outward\nappearances had no assets of which to boast.",
    "Nevertheless to Poirot\u2019s\neye there was no despondency there and no sense of failure.",
    "Miss\nWilliams\u2019s life had been interesting to her\u2014she was still interested in\npeople and events.",
    "She had that enormous mental and moral advantage\nof a strict Victorian upbringing denied to us in these days\u2014she had done\nher duty in that station of life to which it had pleased God to call her and\nthat assurance encased her in an armour impregnable to the slings and\ndarts of envy discontent and regret.",
    "She had her memories her small\npleasures made possible by stringent economies and sufficient health\nand vigour to enable her still to be interested in life.",
    "Now in Angela Warren\u2014that young creature handicapped by\ndisfigurement and its consequent humiliation Poirot believed he saw a\nspirit strengthened by its necessary fight for confidence and assurance.",
    "The undisciplined schoolgirl had given place to a vital and forceful\nwoman a woman of considerable mental power and gifted with\nabundant energy to accomplish ambitious purposes.",
    "She was a woman\nPoirot felt sure both happy and successful.",
    "Her life was full and vivid\nand eminently enjoyable.",
    "She was not incidentally the type of woman that Poirot really liked.",
    "Though admiring the clearcut precision of her mind she had just a\nsufficient nuance of the femme formidable about her to alarm him as a\nmere man.",
    "His taste had always been for the flamboyant and extravagant.",
    "With Angela Warren it was easy to come to the point of his visit.",
    "There was no subterfuge.",
    "He merely recounted Carla Lemarchant\u2019s\ninterview with him.",
    "Angela Warren\u2019s severe face lighted up appreciatively.",
    "\u201cLittle Carla She is over here I would like to see her so much.\u201d\n\u201cYou have not kept in touch with her\u201d\n\u201cHardly as much as I should have done.",
    "I was a schoolgirl at the time\nshe went to Canada and I realized of course that in a year or two she\nwould have forgotten us.",
    "Of late years an occasional present at\nChristmas has been the only link between us.",
    "I imagined that she would\nby now be completely immersed in the Canadian atmosphere and that\nher future would lie over there.",
    "Better so in the circumstances.\u201d\n\n\fPoirot said \u201cOne might think so certainly.",
    "A change of name\u2014a\nchange of scene.",
    "A new life.",
    "But it was not to be so easy as that.\u201d\nAnd he then told of Carla\u2019s engagement the discovery she had made\nupon coming of age and her motives in coming to England.",
    "Angela Warren listened quietly her disfigured cheek resting on one\nhand.",
    "She betrayed no emotion during the recital but as Poirot finished\nshe said quietly\n\u201cGood for Carla.\u201d\nPoirot was startled.",
    "It was the first time that he had met with this\nreaction.",
    "He said\n\u201cYou approve Miss Warren\u201d\n\u201cCertainly.",
    "I wish her every success.",
    "Anything I can do to help I will.",
    "I feel guilty you know that I haven\u2019t attempted anything myself.\u201d\n\u201cThen you think that there is a possibility that she is right in her\nviews.\u201d\nAngela Warren said sharply\n\u201cOf course she\u2019s right.",
    "Caroline didn\u2019t do it.",
    "I\u2019ve always known that.\u201d\nHercule Poirot murmured\n\u201cYou surprise me very much indeed mademoiselle.",
    "Everybody else I\nhave spoken to\u2014\u201d\nShe cut in sharply\n\u201cYou mustn\u2019t go by that.",
    "I\u2019ve no doubt that the circumstantial\nevidence is overwhelming.",
    "My own conviction is based on knowledge\u2014\nknowledge of my sister.",
    "I just know quite simply and definitely that Caro\ncouldn\u2019t have killed anyone.\u201d\n\u201cCan one say that with certainty of any human creature\u201d\n\u201cProbably not in most cases.",
    "I agree that the human animal is full of\ncurious surprises.",
    "But in Caroline\u2019s case there were special reasons\u2014\nreasons which I have a better chance of appreciating than anyone else\ncould.\u201d\nShe touched her damaged cheek.",
    "\u201cYou see this You\u2019ve probably heard about it\u201d Poirot nodded.",
    "\u201cCaroline did that.",
    "That\u2019s why I\u2019m sure\u2014I know\u2014that she didn\u2019t do\nmurder.\u201d\n\u201cIt would not be a convincing argument to most people.\u201d\n\u201cNo it would be the opposite.",
    "It was actually used in that way I\nbelieve.",
    "As evidence that Caroline had a violent and ungovernable\n\n\ftemper Because she had injured me as a baby learned men argued that\nshe would be equally capable of poisoning an unfaithful husband.\u201d\nPoirot said\n\u201cI at least appreciated the difference.",
    "A sudden fit of ungovernable\nrage does not lead you to first abstract a poison and then use it\ndeliberately on the following day.\u201d\nAngela Warren waved an impatient hand.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s not what I mean at all.",
    "I must try and make it plain to you.",
    "Supposing that you are a person normally affectionate and of kindly\ndisposition\u2014but that you are also liable to intense jealousy.",
    "And\nsupposing that during the years of your life when control is most\ndifficult you do in a fit of rage come near to committing what is in\neffect murder.",
    "Think of the awful shock the horror the remorse that\nseizes upon you.",
    "To a sensitive person like Caroline that horror and\nremorse will never quite leave you.",
    "It never left her.",
    "I don\u2019t suppose I\nwas consciously aware of it at the time but looking back I recognize it\nperfectly.",
    "Caro was haunted continually haunted by the fact that she had\ninjured me.",
    "That knowledge never left her in peace.",
    "It coloured all her\nactions.",
    "It explained her attitude to me.",
    "Nothing was too good for me.",
    "In\nher eyes I must always come first.",
    "Half the quarrels she had with Amyas\nwere on my account.",
    "I was inclined to be jealous of him and played all\nkinds of tricks on him.",
    "I pinched cat stuff to put in his drink and once I\nput a hedgehog in his bed.",
    "But Caroline was always on my side.\u201d\nMiss Warren paused then she went on\n\u201cIt was very bad for me of course.",
    "I got horribly spoilt.",
    "But that\u2019s\nneither here nor there.",
    "We\u2019re discussing the effect on Caroline.",
    "The result\nof that impulse to violence was a lifelong abhorrence of any further act\nof the same kind.",
    "Caro was always watching herself always in fear that\nsomething of that kind might happen again.",
    "And she took her own ways\nof guarding against it.",
    "One of these ways was a great extravagance of\nlanguage.",
    "She felt and I think psychologically quite truly that if she\nwere violent enough in speech she would have no temptation to violence\nin action.",
    "She found by experience that the method worked.",
    "That\u2019s why\nI\u2019ve heard Caro say things like \u2018I\u2019d like to cut so and so in pieces and\nboil him slowly in oil.\u2019 And she\u2019d say to me or to Amyas \u2018If you go on\nannoying me I shall murder you.\u2019 In the same way she quarrelled easily\nand violently.",
    "She recognized I think the impulse to violence that there\n\n\fwas in her nature and she deliberately gave it an outlet that way.",
    "She and\nAmyas used to have the most fantastic and lurid quarrels.\u201d\nHercule Poirot nodded.",
    "\u201cYes there was evidence of that.",
    "They quarrelled like cat and dog it\nwas said.\u201d\nAngela Warren said\n\u201cExactly.",
    "That\u2019s what is so stupid and misleading about evidence.",
    "Of\ncourse Caro and Amyas quarrelled Of course they said bitter and\noutrageous and cruel things to each other What nobody appreciates is\nthat they enjoyed quarrelling.",
    "But they did Amyas enjoyed it too.",
    "They\nwere that kind of couple.",
    "They both of them liked drama and emotional\nscenes.",
    "Most men don\u2019t.",
    "They like peace.",
    "But Amyas was an artist.",
    "He\nliked shouting and threatening and generally being outrageous.",
    "It was\nlike letting off steam to him.",
    "He was the kind of man who when he loses\nhis collar stud bellows the house down.",
    "It sounds very odd I know but\nliving that way with continual rows and makingsup was Amyas\u2019s and\nCaroline\u2019s idea of fun\u201d\nShe made an impatient gesture.",
    "\u201cIf they\u2019d only not hustled me away and let me give evidence I\u2019d\nhave told them that.\u201d Then she shrugged her shoulders.",
    "\u201cBut I don\u2019t\nsuppose they would have believed me.",
    "And anyway then it wouldn\u2019t\nhave been as clear in my mind as it is now.",
    "It was the kind of thing I\nknew but hadn\u2019t thought about and certainly had never dreamed of\nputting into words.\u201d\nShe looked across at Poirot.",
    "\u201cYou do see what I mean\u201d\nHe nodded vigorously.",
    "\u201cI see perfectly\u2014and I realize the absolute rightness of what you\nhave said.",
    "There are people to whom agreement is monotony.",
    "They\nrequire the stimulant of dissension to create drama in their lives.\u201d\n\u201cExactly.\u201d\n\u201cMay I ask you Miss Warren what were your own feelings at the\ntime\u201d\nAngela Warren sighed.",
    "\u201cMostly bewilderment and helplessness I think.",
    "It seemed a fantastic\nnightmare.",
    "Caroline was arrested very soon\u2014about three days\nafterwards I think.",
    "I can still remember my indignation my dumb fury\n\u2014and of course my childish faith that it was just a silly mistake that it\n\n\fwould be all right.",
    "Caro was chiefly perturbed about me\u2014she wanted me\nkept right away from it all as far as possible.",
    "She got Miss Williams to\ntake me away to some relations almost at once.",
    "The police had no\nobjection.",
    "And then when it was decided that my evidence would not be\nneeded arrangements were made for me to go to school abroad.",
    "\u201cI hated going of course.",
    "But it was explained to me that Caro had\nme terribly on her mind and that the only way I could help her was by\ngoing.\u201d\nShe paused.",
    "Then she said\n\u201cSo I went to Munich.",
    "I was there when\u2014when the verdict was\ngiven.",
    "They never let me go to see Caro.",
    "Caro wouldn\u2019t have it.",
    "That\u2019s\nthe only time I think when she failed in understanding.\u201d\n\u201cYou cannot be sure of that Miss Warren.",
    "To visit someone dearly\nloved in a prison might make a terrible impression on a young sensitive\ngirl.\u201d\n\u201cPossibly.\u201d\nAngela Warren got up.",
    "She said\n\u201cAfter the verdict when she had been condemned my sister wrote\nme a letter.",
    "I have never shown it to anyone.",
    "I think I ought to show it to\nyou now.",
    "It may help you to understand the kind of person Caroline was.",
    "If you like you may take it to show to Carla also.\u201d\nShe went to the door then turning back she said\n\u201cCome with me.",
    "There is a portrait of Caroline in my room.\u201d\nFor a second time Poirot stood gazing up at a portrait.",
    "As a painting Caroline Crale\u2019s portrait was mediocre.",
    "But Poirot\nlooked at it with interest\u2014it was not its artistic value that interested him.",
    "He saw a long oval face a gracious line of jaw and a sweet slightly\ntimid expression.",
    "It was a face uncertain of itself emotional with a\nwithdrawn hidden beauty.",
    "It lacked the forcefulness and vitality of her\ndaughter\u2019s face\u2014that energy and joy of life Carla Lemarchant had\ndoubtless inherited from her father.",
    "This was a less positive creature.",
    "Yet\nlooking at the painted face Hercule Poirot understood why an\nimaginative man like Quentin Fogg had not been able to forget her.",
    "Angela Warren stood at his side again\u2014a letter in her hand.",
    "She said quietly\n\u201cNow that you have seen what she was like\u2014read her letter.\u201d\nHe unfolded it carefully and read what Caroline Crale had written\nsixteen years ago.",
    "My darling little Angela\nYou will hear bad news and you will grieve but what I want to\nimpress upon you is that it is all all right.",
    "I have never told you lies\nand I don\u2019t now when I say that I am actually happy\u2014that I feel an\nessential rightness and a peace that I have never known before.",
    "It\u2019s\nall right darling it\u2019s all right.",
    "Don\u2019t look back and regret and grieve\nfor me\u2014go on with your life and succeed.",
    "You can I know.",
    "It\u2019s all all\nright darling and I\u2019m going to Amyas.",
    "I haven\u2019t the least doubt that\nwe shall be together.",
    "I couldn\u2019t have lived without him\u2026Do this one\nthing for me\u2014be happy.",
    "I\u2019ve told you\u2014I\u2019m happy.",
    "One has to pay\none\u2019s debts.",
    "It\u2019s lovely to feel peaceful.",
    "Your loving sister\nCaro\nHercule Poirot read it through twice.",
    "Then he handed it back.",
    "He said\n\u201cThat is a very beautiful letter mademoiselle\u2014and a very remarkable\none.",
    "A very remarkable one.\u201d\n\u201cCaroline\u201d said Angela Warren \u201cwas a very remarkable person.\u201d\n\u201cYes an unusual mind\u2026You take it that this letter indicates\ninnocence\u201d\n\u201cOf course it does\u201d\n\u201cIt does not say so explicitly.\u201d\n\u201cBecause Caro would know that I\u2019d never dream of her being guilty\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps\u2014perhaps\u2026But it might be taken another way.",
    "In the sense\nthat she was guilty and that in expiating her crime she will find peace.\u201d\nIt fitted in he thought with the description of her in court.",
    "And he\nexperienced in this moment the strongest doubts he had yet felt of the\ncourse to which he had committed himself.",
    "Everything so far had pointed\nunswervingly to Caroline Crale\u2019s guilt.",
    "Now even her own words\ntestified against her.",
    "On the other side was only the unshaken conviction of Angela\nWarren.",
    "Angela had known her well undoubtedly but might not her\ncertainty be the fanatical loyalty of an adolescent girl up in arms for a\ndearly loved sister\nAs though she had read his thoughts Angela Warren said\n\u201cNo Mr. Poirot\u2014I know Caroline wasn\u2019t guilty.\u201d\nPoirot said briskly\n\n\f\u201cThe Bon Dieu knows I do not want to shake you on that point.",
    "But\nlet us be practical.",
    "You say your sister was not guilty.",
    "Very well then\nwhat really happened\u201d\nAngela nodded thoughtfully.",
    "She said\n\u201cThat is difficult I agree.",
    "I suppose that as Caroline said Amyas\ncommitted suicide.\u201d\n\u201cIs that likely from what you know of his character\u201d\n\u201cVery unlikely.\u201d\n\u201cBut you do not say as in the first case that you know it is\nimpossible\u201d\n\u201cNo because as I said just now most people do do impossible things\n\u2014that is to say things that seem out of character.",
    "But I presume if you\nknow them intimately it wouldn\u2019t be out of character.\u201d\n\u201cYou knew your brotherinlaw well\u201d\n\u201cYes but not like I knew Caro.",
    "It seems to me quite fantastic that\nAmyas should have killed himself\u2014but I suppose he could have done so.",
    "In fact he must have done so.\u201d\n\u201cYou cannot see any other explanation\u201d\nAngela accepted the suggestion calmly but not without a certain\nstirring of interest.",
    "\u201cOh I see what you mean\u2026I\u2019ve never really considered that\npossibility.",

    "There isn\u2019t now when I look back\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cAll the same let us consider the possibility.",
    "Who of those intimately\nconcerned would you say was\u2014shall we say\u2014the most likely person\u201d\n\u201cLet me think.",
    "Well I didn\u2019t kill him.",
    "And the Elsa creature certainly\ndidn\u2019t.",
    "She was mad with rage when he died.",
    "Who else was there\nMeredith Blake He was always very devoted to Caroline quite a tame\ncat about the house.",
    "I suppose that might give him a motive in a way.",
    "In a\nbook he might have wanted to get Amyas out of the way so that he\nhimself could marry Caroline.",
    "But he could have achieved that just as\nwell by letting Amyas go off with Elsa and then in due time consoling\n\n\fCaroline.",
    "Besides I really can\u2019t see Meredith as a murderer.",
    "Too mild and\ntoo cautious.",
    "Who else was there\u201d\nPoirot suggested \u201cMiss Williams Philip Blake\u201d\nAngela\u2019s grave face relaxed into a smile for a minute.",
    "\u201cMiss Williams One can\u2019t really make oneself believe that one\u2019s\ngoverness could commit a murder Miss Williams was always so\nunyielding and so full of rectitude.\u201d\nShe paused a minute and then went on\n\u201cShe was devoted to Caroline of course.",
    "Would have done anything\nfor her.",
    "And she hated Amyas.",
    "She was a great feminist and disliked\nmen.",
    "Is that enough for murder Surely not.\u201d\n\u201cIt would hardly seem so\u201d agreed Poirot.",
    "Angela went on\n\u201cPhilip Blake\u201d She was silent for some few moments.",
    "Then she said\nquietly \u201cI think you know if we\u2019re just talking of likelihoods he\u2019s the\nmost likely person.\u201d\nPoirot said\n\u201cYou interest me very much Miss Warren.",
    "May I ask why you say\nthat\u201d\n\u201cNothing at all definite.",
    "But from what I remember of him I should\nsay he was a person of rather limited imagination.\u201d\n\u201cAnd a limited imagination predisposes you to murder\u201d\n\u201cIt might lead you to take a crude way of settling your difficulties.",
    "Men of that type get a certain satisfaction from action of some kind or\nother.",
    "Murder is a very crude business don\u2019t you think so\u201d\n\u201cYes\u2014I think you are right\u2026It is definitely a point of view that.",
    "But\nall the same Miss Warren there must be more to it than that.",
    "What\nmotive could Philip Blake possibly have had\u201d\nAngela Warren did not answer at once.",
    "She stood frowning down at\nthe floor.",
    "Hercule Poirot said\n\u201cHe was Amyas Crale\u2019s best friend was he not\u201d\nShe nodded.",
    "\u201cBut there is something in your mind Miss Warren.",
    "Something that\nyou have not yet told me.",
    "Were the two men rivals perhaps over the girl\n\u2014over Elsa\u201d\nAngela Warren shook her head.",
    "\u201cOh no not Philip.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cWhat is there then\u201d\nAngela Warren said slowly\n\u201cDo you know the way that things suddenly come back to you\u2014after\nyears perhaps.",
    "I\u2019ll explain what I mean.",
    "Somebody told me a story once\nwhen I was eleven.",
    "I saw no point in that story whatsoever.",
    "It didn\u2019t\nworry me\u2014it just passed straight over my head.",
    "I don\u2019t believe I ever as\nthey say thought of it again.",
    "But about two years ago sitting in the stalls\nat a revue that story came back to me and I was so surprised that I\nactually said aloud \u2018Oh now I see the point of that silly story about the\nrice pudding.\u2019 And yet there had been no direct allusion on the same\nlines\u2014only some fun sailing rather near the wind.\u201d\nPoirot said \u201cI understand what you mean mademoiselle.\u201d\n\u201cThen you will understand what I am going to tell you.",
    "I was once\nstaying at a hotel.",
    "As I walked along a passage one of the bedroom\ndoors opened and a woman I knew came out.",
    "It was not her bedroom\u2014\nand she registered the fact plainly on her face when she saw me.",
    "\u201cAnd I knew then the meaning of the expression I had once seen on\nCaroline\u2019s face when at Alderbury she came out of Philip Blake\u2019s room\none night.\u201d\nShe leant forward stopping Poirot\u2019s words.",
    "\u201cI had no idea at the time you understand.",
    "I knew things\u2014girls of the\nage I was usually do\u2014but I didn\u2019t connect them with reality.",
    "Caroline\ncoming out of Philip Blake\u2019s bedroom was just Caroline coming out of\nPhilip Blake\u2019s bedroom to me.",
    "It might have been Miss William\u2019s room\nor my room.",
    "But what I did notice was the expression on her face\u2014a\nqueer expression that I didn\u2019t know and couldn\u2019t understand.",
    "I didn\u2019t\nunderstand it until as I have told you the night in Paris when I saw that\nsame expression on another woman\u2019s face.\u201d\nPoirot said slowly\n\u201cBut what you tell me Miss Warren is sufficiently astonishing.",
    "From\nPhilip Blake himself I got the impression that he disliked your sister and\nalways had done so.\u201d\nAngela said\n\u201cI know.",
    "I can\u2019t explain it but there it is.\u201d\nPoirot nodded slowly.",
    "Already in his interview with Philip Blake he\nhad felt vaguely that something did not ring true.",
    "That overdone\nanimosity against Caroline\u2014it had not somehow been natural.",
    "And the words and phrases from his conversation with Meredith\nBlake came back to him.",
    "\u201cVery upset when Amyas married\u2014did not go\nnear them for over a year\u2026.\u201d\nHad Philip then always been in love with Caroline And had his\nlove when she chose Amyas turned to bitterness and hate\nYes Philip had been too vehement\u2014too biased.",
    "Poirot visualized him\nthoughtfully\u2014the cheerful prosperous man with his golf and his\ncomfortable house.",
    "What had Philip Blake really felt sixteen years ago.",
    "Angela Warren was speaking.",
    "\u201cI don\u2019t understand it.",
    "You see I\u2019ve no experience in love affairs\u2014\nthey haven\u2019t come my way.",
    "I\u2019ve told you this for what it\u2019s worth in case\n\u2014in case it might have a bearing on what happened.\u201d\n\n\f\fBOOK TWO\n\n\f\fNarrative of Philip Blake\nCovering letter received with manuscript\nDear Mr. Poirot\nI am fulfilling my promise and herewith find enclosed an account\nof the events relating to the death of Amyas Crale.",
    "After such a lapse\nof time I am bound to point out that my memories may not be strictly\naccurate but I have put down what occurred to the best of my\nrecollection.",
    "Yours truly\nPhilip Blake\nNotes on Progress of Events Leading up to Murder of Amyas Crale on\nSept. 19\u2026.",
    "My friendship with deceased dates back to a very early period.",
    "His home\nand mine were next door to each other in the country and our families\nwere friends.",
    "Amyas Crale was a little over two years older than I was.",
    "We played together as boys in the holidays though we were not at the\nsame school.",
    "From the point of view of my long knowledge of the man I feel\nmyself particularly qualified to testify as to his character and general\noutlook on life.",
    "And I will say this straight away\u2014to anyone who knew\nAmyas Crale well\u2014the notion of his committing suicide is quite\nridiculous.",
    "Crale would never have taken his own life.",
    "He was far too\nfond of living The contention of the defence at the trial that Crale was\nobsessed by conscience and took poison in a fit of remorse is utterly\nabsurd to anyone who knew the man.",
    "Crale I should say had very little\nconscience and certainly not a morbid one.",
    "Moreover he and his wife\nwere on bad terms and I don\u2019t think he would have had any scruples\nabout breaking up what was to him a very unsatisfactory married life.",
    "He was prepared to look after her financial welfare and that of the child\nof the marriage and I am sure would have done so generously.",
    "He was a\nvery generous man\u2014and altogether a warmhearted and lovable person.",
    "Not only was he a great painter but he was a man whose friends were\ndevoted to him.",
    "As far as I know he had no enemies.",
    "I had also known Caroline Crale for many years.",
    "I knew her before\nher marriage when she used to come and stay at Alderbury.",
    "She was\nthen a somewhat neurotic girl subject to uncontrollable outbursts of\ntemper not without attraction but unquestionably a difficult person to\nlive with.",
    "She showed her devotion to Amyas almost immediately.",
    "He I do not\nthink was really very much in love with her.",
    "But they were frequently\nthrown together\u2014she was as I say attractive and they eventually\nbecame engaged.",
    "Amyas Crale\u2019s best friends were rather apprehensive\nabout the marriage as they felt that Caroline was quite unsuited to him.",
    "This caused a certain amount of strain in the first few years between\nCrale\u2019s wife and Crale\u2019s friends but Amyas was a loyal friend and was\nnot disposed to give up his old friends at the bidding of his wife.",
    "After a\nfew years he and I were on the same old terms and I was a frequent\nvisitor at Alderbury.",
    "I may add that I stood godfather to the little girl\nCarla.",
    "This proves I think that Amyas considered me his best friend\nand it gives me authority to speak for a man who can no longer speak for\nhimself.",
    "To come to the actual events of which I have been asked to write I\narrived down at Alderbury so I see by an old diary five days before the\ncrime.",
    "That is on Sept. 13th.",
    "I was conscious at once of a certain tension\nin the atmosphere.",
    "There was also staying in the house Miss Elsa Greer\nwhom Amyas was painting at the time.",
    "It was the first time I had seen Miss Greer in the flesh but I had been\naware of her existence for some time.",
    "Amyas had raved about her to me\na month previously.",
    "He had met he said a marvellous girl.",
    "He talked\nabout her so enthusiastically that I said to him jokingly \u201cBe careful old\nboy or you\u2019ll be losing your head again.\u201d He told me not to be a bloody\nfool.",
    "He was painting the girl he\u2019d no personal interest in her.",
    "I said\n\u201cTell that to the marines I\u2019ve heard you say that before.\u201d He said \u201cThis\ntime it\u2019s different\u201d to which I answered somewhat cynically \u201cIt always\nis\u201d Amyas then looked quite worried and anxious.",
    "He said \u201cYou don\u2019t\nunderstand.",
    "She\u2019s just a girl.",
    "Not much more than a child.\u201d He added that\nshe had very modern views and was absolutely free from oldfashioned\nprejudices.",
    "He said \u201cShe\u2019s honest and natural and absolutely fearless\u201d\n\n\fI thought to myself though I didn\u2019t say so that Amyas had certainly\ngot it badly this time.",
    "A few weeks later I heard comments from other\npeople.",
    "It was said that the \u201cGreer girl was absolutely infatuated.\u201d\nSomebody else said that it was a bit thick of Amyas considering how\nyoung the girl was whereupon somebody else sniggered and said that\nElsa Greer knew her way about all right.",
    "Further remarks were that the\ngirl was rolling in money and had always got everything she wanted and\nalso that \u201cshe was the one who was making most of the running.\u201d There\nwas a question as to what Crale\u2019s wife thought about it\u2014and the\nsignificant reply that she must be used to that sort of thing by now to\nwhich someone demurred by saying they\u2019d heard that she was jealous as\nhell and led Crale such an impossible life that any man would be\njustified in having a fling from time to time.",
    "I mention all this because I think it is important that the state of\naffairs before I got down there should be fully realized.",
    "I was interested to see the girl\u2014she was remarkably goodlooking\nand very attractive\u2014and I was I must admit maliciously amused to note\nthat Caroline was cutting up very rough indeed.",
    "Amyas Crale himself was less lighthearted than usual.",
    "Though to\nanyone who did not know him well his manner would have appeared\nmuch as usual I who knew him so intimately noted at once various signs\nof strain uncertain temper fits of moody abstraction general irritability\nof manner.",
    "Although he was always inclined to be moody when painting the\npicture he was at work upon did not account entirely for the strain he\nshowed.",
    "He was pleased to see me and said as soon as we were alone\n\u201cThank goodness you\u2019ve turned up Phil.",
    "Living in a house with four\nwomen is enough to send any man clean off his chump.",
    "Between them\nall they\u2019ll send me into a lunatic asylum.\u201d\nIt was certainly an uncomfortable atmosphere.",
    "Caroline as I said was\nobviously cutting up rough about the whole thing.",
    "In a polite wellbred\nway she was ruder to Elsa than one would believe possible\u2014without a\nsingle actually offensive word.",
    "Elsa herself was openly and flagrantly\nrude to Caroline.",
    "She was top dog and she knew it\u2014and no scruples of\ngood breeding restrained her from overt bad manners.",
    "The result was that\nCrale spent most of his time scrapping with the girl Angela when he\nwasn\u2019t painting.",
    "They were usually on affectionate terms though they\nteased and fought a good deal.",
    "But on this occasion there was an edge in\n\n\feverything Amyas said or did and the two of them really lost their\ntempers with each other.",
    "The fourth member of the party was the\ngoverness.",
    "\u201cA sourfaced hag\u201d Amyas called her.",
    "\u201cShe hates me like\npoison.",
    "Sits there with her lips set together disapproving of me without\nstopping.\u201d\nIt was then that he said\n\u201cGod damn all women If a man is to have any peace he must steer\nclear of women\u201d\n\u201cYou oughtn\u2019t to have married\u201d I said.",
    "\u201cYou\u2019re the sort of man who\nought to have kept clear of domestic ties.\u201d\nHe replied that it was too late to talk about that now.",
    "He added that no\ndoubt Caroline would be only too glad to get rid of him.",
    "That was the\nfirst indication I had that something unusual was in the wind.",
    "I said \u201cWhat\u2019s all this Is this business with the lovely Elsa serious\nthen\u201d He said with a sort of groan\n\u201cShe is lovely isn\u2019t she Sometimes I wish I\u2019d never seen her.\u201d\nI said \u201cLook here old boy you must take a hold on yourself.",
    "You\ndon\u2019t want to get tied up with any more women.\u201d He looked at me and\nlaughed.",
    "He said \u201cIt\u2019s all very well for you to talk.",
    "I can\u2019t let women\nalone\u2014simply can\u2019t do it\u2014and if I could they wouldn\u2019t let me alone\u201d\nThen he shrugged those great shoulders of his grinned at me and said\n\u201cOh well it will all pan out in the end I expect.",
    "And you must admit the\npicture is good\u201d\nHe was referring to the portrait he was doing of Elsa and although I\nhad very little technical knowledge of painting even I could see that it\nwas going to be a work of especial power.",
    "Whilst he was painting Amyas was a different man.",
    "Although he\nwould growl groan frown swear extravagantly and sometimes hurl his\nbrushes away he was really intensely happy.",
    "It was only when he came back to the house for meals that the hostile\natmosphere between the women got him down.",
    "That hostility came to a\nhead on Sept. 17th.",
    "We had had an embarrassing lunch.",
    "Elsa had been\nparticularly\u2014really I think insolent is the only word for it She had\nignored Caroline pointedly persistently addressing the conversation to\nAmyas as though he and she were alone in the room.",
    "Caroline had talked\nlightly and gaily to the rest of us cleverly contriving so that several\nperfectly innocentsounding remarks should have a sting.",
    "She hadn\u2019t got\n\n\fElsa Greer\u2019s scornful honesty\u2014with Caroline every thing was oblique\nsuggested rather than said.",
    "Things came to a head after lunch in the drawing room just as we\nwere finishing coffee.",
    "I had commented on a carved head in highly\npolished beechwood\u2014a very curious thing and Caroline said \u201cThat is\nthe work of a young Norwegian sculptor.",
    "Amyas and I admire his work\nvery much.",
    "We hope to go and see him next summer.\u201d That calm\nassumption of possession was too much for Elsa.",
    "She was never one to\nlet a challenge pass.",
    "She waited a minute or two and then she spoke in\nher clear rather overemphasized voice.",
    "She said \u201cThis would be a\nlovely room if it was properly fixed.",
    "It\u2019s got far too much furniture in it.",
    "When I\u2019m living here I shall take all the rubbish out and just leave one or\ntwo good pieces.",
    "And I shall have coppercoloured curtains I think\u2014so\nthat the setting sun will just catch them through that big western\nwindow.\u201d She turned to me and said.",
    "\u201cDon\u2019t you think that would be\nrather lovely\u201d\nI didn\u2019t have time to answer.",
    "Caroline spoke and her voice was soft\nand silky and what I can only describe as dangerous.",
    "She said\n\u201cAre you thinking of buying this place Elsa\u201d\nElsa said \u201cIt won\u2019t be necessary for me to buy it.\u201d\nCaroline said \u201cWhat do you mean\u201d And there was no softness in her\nvoice now.",
    "It was hard and metallic.",
    "Elsa laughed.",
    "She said \u201cMust we\npretend Come now Caroline you know very well what I mean\u201d\nCaroline said \u201cI\u2019ve no idea.\u201d\nElsa said to that \u201cDon\u2019t be such an ostrich.",
    "It\u2019s no good pretending\nyou don\u2019t see and know all about it.",
    "Amyas and I care for each other.",
    "This isn\u2019t your home.",
    "It\u2019s his.",
    "And after we\u2019re married I shall live here\nwith him\u201d\nCaroline said \u201cI think you\u2019re crazy.\u201d\nElsa said \u201cOh no I\u2019m not my dear and you know it.",
    "It would be\nmuch simpler if we were honest with each other.",
    "Amyas and I love each\nother\u2014you\u2019ve seen that clearly enough.",
    "There\u2019s only one decent thing\nfor you to do.",
    "You\u2019ve got to give him his freedom.\u201d\nCaroline said \u201cI don\u2019t believe a word of what you are saying.\u201d\nBut her voice was unconvincing.",
    "Elsa had got under her guard all\nright.",
    "And at that minute Amyas Crale came into the room and Elsa said\nwith a laugh\n\n\f\u201cIf you don\u2019t believe me ask him.\u201d\nAnd Caroline said \u201cI will.\u201d\nShe didn\u2019t pause at all.",
    "She said\n\u201cAmyas Elsa says you want to marry her.",
    "Is this true\u201d\nPoor Amyas.",
    "I felt sorry for him.",
    "It makes a man feel a fool to have a\nscene of that kind forced upon him.",
    "He went crimson and started\nblustering.",
    "He turned on Elsa and asked her why the devil she couldn\u2019t\nhave held her tongue\nCaroline said \u201cThen it is true\u201d\nHe didn\u2019t say anything just stood there passing his finger round\ninside the neck of his shirt.",
    "He used to do that as a kid when he got into a\njam of any kind.",
    "He said\u2014and he tried to make the words sound\ndignified and authoritative\u2014and of course couldn\u2019t manage it poor\ndevil\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to discuss it.\u201d\nCaroline said \u201cBut we\u2019re going to discuss it\u201d\nElsa chipped in and said\n\u201cI think it\u2019s only fair to Caroline that she should be told.\u201d\nCaroline said very quietly\n\u201cIs it true Amyas\u201d\nHe looked a bit ashamed of himself.",
    "Men do when women pin them\ndown in a corner.",
    "She said\n\u201cAnswer me please.",
    "I\u2019ve got to know.\u201d\nHe flung up his head then\u2014rather the way a bull does in the bullring.",
    "He snapped out\n\u201cIt\u2019s true enough\u2014but I don\u2019t want to discuss it now.\u201d\nAnd he turned and strode out of the room.",
    "I went after him.",
    "I didn\u2019t\nwant to be left with the women.",
    "I caught up with him on the terrace.",
    "He\nwas swearing.",
    "I never knew a man swear more heartily.",
    "Then he raved\n\u201cWhy couldn\u2019t she hold her tongue Why the devil couldn\u2019t she hold\nher tongue Now the fat\u2019s in the fire.",
    "And I\u2019ve got to finish that picture\n\u2014do you hear Phil It\u2019s the best thing I\u2019ve done.",
    "The best thing I\u2019ve\never done in my life.",
    "And a couple of damn\u2019 fool women want to muck it\nup between them\u201d\nThen he calmed down a little and said women had no sense of\nproportion.",
    "I couldn\u2019t help smiling a little.",
    "I said\n\n\f\u201cWell dash it all old boy you have brought this on yourself.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t I know it\u201d he said and groaned.",
    "Then he added \u201cBut you\nmust admit Phil that a man couldn\u2019t be blamed for losing his head about\nher.",
    "Even Caroline ought to understand that.\u201d\nI asked him what would happen if Caroline got her back up and\nrefused to give him a divorce.",
    "But by now he had gone off into a fit of abstraction.",
    "I repeated the\nremark and he said absently\n\u201cCaroline would never be vindictive.",
    "You don\u2019t understand old boy.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s the child\u201d I pointed out.",
    "He took me by the arm.",
    "\u201cPhil old boy you mean well\u2014but don\u2019t go on croaking like a raven.",
    "I can manage my affairs.",
    "Everything will turn out all right.",
    "You\u2019ll see if it\ndoesn\u2019t.\u201d\nThat was Amyas all over\u2014an absolutely unjustified optimist.",
    "He said\nnow cheerfully\n\u201cTo hell with the whole pack of them\u201d\nI don\u2019t know whether we would have said anything more but a few\nminutes later Caroline swept out on the terrace.",
    "She\u2019d got a hat on a\nqueer flopping darkbrown hat rather attractive.",
    "She said in an absolutely ordinary everyday voice\n\u201cTake off that paintstained coat Amyas.",
    "We\u2019re going over to\nMeredith\u2019s to tea\u2014don\u2019t you remember\u201d\nHe stared stammered a bit as he said\n\u201cOh I\u2019d forgotten.",
    "Yes of cccourse we are.\u201d\nShe said\n\u201cThen go and try and make yourself look less like a ragandbone\nman.\u201d\nAlthough her voice was quite natural she didn\u2019t look at him.",
    "She\nmoved over towards a bed of dahlias and began picking off some of the\noverblown flowers.",
    "Amyas turned round slowly and went into the house.",
    "Caroline talked to me.",
    "She talked a good deal.",
    "About the chances of\nthe weather lasting.",
    "And whether there might be mackerel about and if\nso Amyas and Angela and I might like to go fishing.",
    "She was really\namazing.",
    "I\u2019ve got to hand it to her.",
    "But I think myself that that showed the sort of woman she was.",
    "She\nhad enormous strength of will and complete command over herself.",
    "I\n\n\fdon\u2019t know whether she\u2019d made up her mind to kill him then\u2014but I\nshouldn\u2019t be surprised.",
    "And she was capable of making her plans\ncarefully and unemotionally with an absolutely clear and ruthless mind.",
    "Caroline Crale was a very dangerous woman.",
    "I ought to have realized\nthen that she wasn\u2019t prepared to take this thing lying down.",
    "But like a\nfool I thought that she had made up her mind to accept the inevitable\u2014or\nelse possibly she thought that if she carried on exactly as usual Amyas\nmight change his mind.",
    "Presently the others came out.",
    "Elsa looking defiant\u2014but at the same\ntime triumphant.",
    "Caroline took no notice of her.",
    "Angela really saved the\nsituation.",
    "She came out arguing with Miss Williams that she wasn\u2019t\ngoing to change her skirt for anyone.",
    "It was quite all right\u2014good enough\nfor darling old Meredith anyway\u2014he never noticed anything.",
    "We got off at last.",
    "Caroline walked with Angela.",
    "And I walked with\nAmyas.",
    "And Elsa walked by herself\u2014smiling.",
    "I didn\u2019t admire her myself\u2014too violent a type\u2014but I have to admit\nthat she looked incredibly beautiful that afternoon.",
    "Women do when\nthey\u2019ve got what they want.",
    "I can\u2019t remember the events of that afternoon clearly at all.",
    "It\u2019s all\nblurred.",
    "I remember old Merry coming out to meet us.",
    "I think we walked\nround the garden first.",
    "I remember having a long discussion with Angela\nabout the training of terriers for ratting.",
    "She ate an incredible lot of\napples and tried to persuade me to do so too.",
    "When we got back to the house tea was going on under the big cedar\ntree.",
    "Merry I remember was looking very upset.",
    "I suppose either\nCaroline or Amyas had told him something.",
    "He was looking doubtfully\nat Caroline and then he stared at Elsa.",
    "The old boy looked thoroughly\nworried.",
    "Of course Caroline liked to have Meredith on a string more or\nless the devoted platonic friend who would never never go too far.",
    "She\nwas that kind of woman.",
    "After tea Meredith had a hurried word with me.",
    "He said\n\u201cLook here Phil Amyas can\u2019t do this thing\u201d\nI said\n\u201cMake no mistake he\u2019s going to do it.\u201d\n\u201cHe can\u2019t leave his wife and child and go off with this girl.",
    "He\u2019s years\nolder than she is.",
    "She can\u2019t be more than eighteen.\u201d\nI said to him that Miss Greer was a fully sophisticated twenty.",
    "He said \u201cAnyway that\u2019s under age.",
    "She can\u2019t know what she\u2019s\ndoing.\u201d\nPoor old Meredith.",
    "Always the chivalrous pukka sahib.",
    "I said\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry old boy.",
    "She knows what she\u2019s doing and she likes it\u201d\nThat\u2019s all we had the chance of saying.",
    "I thought to myself that\nprobably Merry felt disturbed at the thought of Caroline being a deserted\nwife.",
    "Once the divorce was through she might expect her faithful Dobbin\nto marry her.",
    "I had an idea that hopeless devotion was really far more in\nhis line.",
    "I must confess that that side of it amused me.",
    "Curiously enough I remember very little about our visit to Meredith\u2019s\nstink room.",
    "He enjoyed showing people his hobby.",
    "Personally I always\nfound it very boring.",
    "I suppose I was in there with the rest of them when\nhe gave a dissertation on the efficacy of coniine but I don\u2019t remember it.",
    "And I didn\u2019t see Caroline pinch the stuff.",
    "As I\u2019ve said she was a very\nadroit woman.",
    "I do remember Meredith reading aloud the passage from\nPlato describing Socrates\u2019 death.",
    "Very boring I thought it.",
    "Classics\nalways did bore me.",
    "There\u2019s nothing much more I can remember about that day.",
    "Amyas\nand Angela had a firstclass row I know and the rest of us rather\nwelcomed it.",
    "It avoided other difficulties.",
    "Angela rushed off to bed with\na final vituperative outburst.",
    "She said A she\u2019d pay him out.",
    "B she\nwished he were dead.",
    "C she hoped he\u2019d die of leprosy it would serve\nhim right.",
    "D she wished a sausage would stick to his nose like in the\nfairy story and never come off.",
    "When she\u2019d gone we all laughed we\ncouldn\u2019t help it it was such a funny mixture.",
    "Caroline went up to bed immediately afterwards.",
    "Miss Williams\ndisappeared after her pupil.",
    "Amyas and Elsa went off together into the\ngarden.",
    "It was clear that I wasn\u2019t wanted.",
    "I went for a stroll by myself.",
    "It\nwas a lovely night.",
    "I came down late the following morning.",
    "There was no one in the\ndining room.",
    "Funny the things you do remember.",
    "I remember the taste of\nthe kidneys and bacon I ate quite well.",
    "They were very good kidneys.",
    "Devilled.",
    "Afterwards I wandered out looking for everybody.",
    "I went outside\ndidn\u2019t see anybody smoked a cigarette encountered Miss Williams\nrunning about looking for Angela who had played truant as usual when\nshe ought to have been mending a torn frock.",
    "I went back into the hall\n\n\fand realized that Amyas and Caroline were having a setto in the library.",
    "They were talking very loud.",
    "I heard her say\n\u201cYou and your women I\u2019d like to kill you.",
    "Some day I will kill you.\u201d\nAmyas said \u201cDon\u2019t be a fool Caroline.\u201d And she said \u201cI mean it\nAmyas.\u201d\nWell I didn\u2019t want to overhear any more.",
    "I went out again.",
    "I\nwandered along the terrace the other way and came across Elsa.",
    "She was sitting on one of the long seats.",
    "The seat was directly under\nthe library window and the window was open.",
    "I should imagine that\nthere wasn\u2019t much she had missed of what was going on inside.",
    "When\nshe saw me she got up as cool as a cucumber and came towards me.",
    "She\nwas smiling.",
    "She took my arm and said\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it a lovely morning\u201d\nIt was a lovely morning for her all right Rather a cruel girl.",
    "No I\nthink merely honest and lacking in imagination.",
    "What she wanted herself\nwas the only thing that she could see.",
    "We\u2019d been standing on the terrace talking for about five minutes\nwhen I heard the library door bang and Amyas Crale came out.",
    "He was\nvery red in the face.",
    "He caught hold of Elsa unceremoniously by the shoulder.",
    "He said \u201cCome on time for you to sit.",
    "I want to get on with that\npicture.\u201d\nShe said \u201cAll right.",
    "I\u2019ll just go up and get a pullover.",
    "There\u2019s a chilly\nwind.\u201d\nShe went into the house.",
    "I wondered if Amyas would say anything to me but he didn\u2019t say\nmuch.",
    "Just \u201cThese women\u201d\nI said \u201cCheer up old boy.\u201d\nThen we neither of us said anything till Elsa came out of the house\nagain.",
    "They went off together down to the Battery garden.",
    "I went into the\nhouse.",
    "Caroline was standing in the hall.",
    "I don\u2019t think she even noticed\nme.",
    "It was a way of hers at times.",
    "She\u2019d seem to go right away\u2014to get\ninside herself as it were.",
    "She just murmured something.",
    "Not to me\u2014to\nherself.",
    "I just caught the words\n\u201cIt\u2019s too cruel\u2026.\u201d\nThat\u2019s what she said.",
    "Then she walked past me and upstairs still\nwithout seeming to see me\u2014just like a person intent on some inner\n\n\fvision.",
    "I think myself I\u2019ve no authority for saying this you understand\nthat she went up to get the stuff and that it was then she decided to do\nwhat she did do.",
    "And just at that moment the telephone rang.",
    "In some houses one\nwould wait for the servants to answer it but I was so often at Alderbury\nthat I acted more or less as one of the family.",
    "I picked up the receiver.",
    "It was my brother Meredith\u2019s voice that answered.",
    "He was very upset.",
    "He explained that he had been into his laboratory and that the coniine\nbottle was halfempty.",
    "I don\u2019t need to go again over all the things I know now I ought to\nhave done.",
    "The thing was so startling and I was foolish enough to be\ntaken aback.",
    "Meredith was dithering a good bit at the other end.",
    "I heard\nsomeone on the stairs and I just told him sharply to come over at once.",
    "I myself went down to meet him.",
    "In case you don\u2019t know the lay of\nthe land the shortest way from one estate to the other was by rowing\nacross a small creek.",
    "I went down the path to where the boats were kept\nby a small jetty.",
    "To do so I passed under the wall of the Battery garden.",
    "I\ncould hear Elsa and Amyas talking as he painted.",
    "They sounded very\ncheerful and carefree.",
    "Amyas said it was an amazingly hot day so it\nwas very hot for September and Elsa said that sitting where she was\npoised on the battlements there was a cold wind blowing in from the\nsea.",
    "And then she said \u201cI\u2019m horribly stiff from posing.",
    "Can\u2019t I have a\nrest darling\u201d And I heard Amyas cry out \u201cNot on your life.",
    "Stick it.",
    "You\u2019re a tough girl.",
    "And this is going good I tell you.\u201d I heard Elsa say\n\u201cBrute\u201d and laugh as I went out of earshot.",
    "Meredith was just rowing himself across from the other side.",
    "I waited\nfor him.",
    "He tied up the boat and came up the steps.",
    "He was looking very\nwhite and worried.",
    "He said to me\n\u201cYour head\u2019s better than mine Philip.",
    "What ought I to do That\nstuff\u2019s dangerous.\u201d\nI said \u201cAre you absolutely sure about this\u201d Meredith you see was\nalways a rather vague kind of chap.",
    "Perhaps that\u2019s why I didn\u2019t take it as\nseriously as I ought to have done.",
    "And he said he was quite sure.",
    "The\nbottle had been full yesterday afternoon.",
    "I said \u201cAnd you\u2019ve absolutely no idea who pinched it\u201d\nHe said none whatever and asked me what I thought.",
    "Could it have\nbeen one of the servants I said I supposed it might have been but it\nseemed unlikely to me.",
    "He always kept the door locked didn\u2019t he\n\n\fAlways he said and then began a rigmarole about having found the\nwindow a few inches open at the bottom.",
    "Someone might have got in\nthat way.",
    "\u201cA chance burglar\u201d I asked sceptically.",
    "\u201cIt seems to me Meredith\nthat there are some very nasty possibilities.\u201d\nHe said what did I really think And I said if he was sure he wasn\u2019t\nmaking a mistake that probably Caroline had taken it to poison Elsa\nwith\u2014or that alternatively Elsa had taken it to get Caroline out of the\nway and straighten the path of true love.",
    "Meredith twittered a bit.",
    "He said it was absurd and melodramatic and\ncouldn\u2019t be true.",
    "I said \u201cWell the stuff\u2019s gone.",
    "What\u2019s your\nexplanation\u201d He hadn\u2019t any of course.",
    "Actually thought just as I did\nbut didn\u2019t want to face the fact.",
    "He said again \u201cWhat are we to do\u201d\nI said damned fool that I was \u201cWe must think it over carefully.",
    "Either you\u2019d better announce your loss straight out when everybody\u2019s\nthere or else you\u2019d better get Caroline alone and tax her with it.",
    "If you\u2019re\nconvinced she\u2019s nothing to do with it adopt the same tactics for Elsa.\u201d\nHe said \u201cA girl like that She couldn\u2019t have taken it.\u201d I said I wouldn\u2019t\nput it past her.",
    "We were walking up to the house as we talked.",
    "After that last remark\nof mine neither of us spoke for some few seconds.",
    "We were rounding the\nBattery garden again and I heard Caroline\u2019s voice.",
    "I thought perhaps a threehanded row was going on but actually it\nwas Angela that they were discussing.",
    "Caroline was protesting.",
    "She said\n\u201cIt\u2019s very hard on the girl.\u201d And Amyas made some impatient rejoinder.",
    "Then the door to the garden opened just as we came abreast of it.",
    "Amyas\nlooked a little taken aback at seeing us.",
    "Caroline was just coming out.",
    "She said \u201cHallo Meredith.",
    "We\u2019ve been discussing the question of\nAngela\u2019s going to school.",
    "I\u2019m not at all sure it\u2019s the right thing for her.\u201d\nAmyas said \u201cDon\u2019t fuss about the girl.",
    "She\u2019ll be all right.",
    "Good\nriddance.\u201d\nJust then Elsa came running down the path from the house.",
    "She had\nsome sort of scarlet jumper in her hand.",
    "Amyas growled\n\u201cCome along.",
    "Get back into the pose.",
    "I don\u2019t want to waste time.\u201d\nHe went back to where his easel was standing.",
    "I noticed that he\nstaggered a bit and I wondered if he had been drinking.",
    "A man might\neasily be excused for doing so with all the fuss and the scenes.",
    "He grumbled.",
    "\u201cThe beer here is red hot.",
    "Why can\u2019t we keep some ice down here\u201d\nAnd Caroline Crale said\n\u201cI\u2019ll send you down some beer just off the ice.\u201d\nAmyas grunted out\n\u201cThanks.\u201d\nThen Caroline shut the door of the Battery garden and came up with\nus to the house.",
    "We sat down on the terrace and she went into the house.",
    "About five minutes later Angela came along with a couple of bottles of\nbeer and some glasses.",
    "It was a hot day and we were glad to see it.",
    "As we\nwere drinking it Caroline passed us.",
    "She was carrying another bottle and\nsaid she would take it down to Amyas.",
    "Meredith said he\u2019d go but she\nwas quite firm that she\u2019d go herself.",
    "I thought\u2014fool that I was\u2014that it\nwas just her jealousy.",
    "She couldn\u2019t stand those two being alone down\nthere.",
    "That was what had taken her down there once already with the\nweak pretext of arguing about Angela\u2019s departure.",
    "She went off down that zigzag path\u2014and Meredith and I watched her\ngo.",
    "We\u2019d still not decided anything and now Angela clamoured that I\nshould come bathing with her.",
    "It seemed impossible to get Meredith\nalone.",
    "I just said to him \u201cAfter lunch.\u201d And he nodded.",
    "Then I went off bathing with Angela.",
    "We had a good swim\u2014across\nthe creek and back and then we lay out on the rocks sunbathing.",
    "Angela\nwas a bit taciturn and that suited me.",
    "I made up my mind that directly\nafter lunch I\u2019d take Caroline aside and accuse her pointblank of having\nstolen the stuff.",
    "No use letting Meredith do it\u2014he\u2019d be too weak.",
    "No I\u2019d\ntax her with it outright.",
    "After that she\u2019d have to give it back or even if\nshe didn\u2019t she wouldn\u2019t dare use it.",
    "I was pretty sure it must be her on\nthinking things over.",
    "Elsa was far too sensible and hardboiled a young\nwoman to risk tampering with poisons.",
    "She had a hard head and would\ntake care of her own skin.",
    "Caroline was made of more dangerous stuff\u2014\nunbalanced carried away by impulses and definitely neurotic.",
    "And still\nyou know at the back of my mind was the feeling that Meredith might\nhave made a mistake.",
    "Or some servant might have been poking about in\nthere and split the stuff and then not dared to own up.",
    "You see poison\nseems such a melodramatic thing\u2014you can\u2019t believe in it.",
    "Not till it happens.",
    "It was quite late when I looked at my watch and Angela and I fairly\nraced up to lunch.",
    "They were just sitting down\u2014all but Amyas who had\n\n\fremained down in the Battery painting.",
    "Quite a normal thing for him to\ndo\u2014and privately I thought him very wise to elect to do it today.",
    "Lunch\nwas likely to have been an awkward meal.",
    "We had coffee on the terrace.",
    "I wish I could remember better how\nCaroline looked and acted.",
    "She didn\u2019t seem excited in any way.",
    "Quiet\nand rather sad is my impression.",
    "What a devil that woman was\nFor it is a devilish thing to do to poison a man in cold blood.",
    "If there\nhad been a revolver about and she caught it up and shot him\u2014well that\nmight have been understandable.",
    "But this cold deliberate vindictive\npoisoning\u2026.",
    "And so calm and collected.",
    "She got up and said she\u2019d take his coffee to him in the most natural\nway possible.",
    "And yet she knew\u2014she must have known\u2014that by now\nshe\u2019d find him dead.",
    "Miss Williams went with her.",
    "I don\u2019t remember if\nthat was at Caroline\u2019s suggestion or not.",
    "I rather think it was.",
    "The two women went off together.",
    "Meredith strolled away shortly\nafterwards.",
    "I was just making an excuse to go after him when he came\nrunning up the path again.",
    "His face was grey.",
    "He gasped out\n\u201cWe must get a doctor\u2014quick\u2014Amyas\u2014\u201d\nI sprang up.",
    "\u201cIs he ill\u2014dying\u201d\nMeredith said\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid he\u2019s dead\u2026.\u201d\nWe\u2019d forgotten Elsa for the minute.",
    "But she let out a sudden cry.",
    "It\nwas like the wail of a banshee.",
    "She cried\n\u201cDead Dead\u2026\u201d And then she ran.",
    "I didn\u2019t know anyone could\nmove like that\u2014like a deer\u2014like a stricken thing.",
    "And like an avenging\nFury too.",
    "Meredith panted out\n\u201cGo after her.",
    "I\u2019ll telephone.",
    "Go after her.",
    "You don\u2019t know what she\u2019ll\ndo.\u201d\nI did go after her\u2014and it\u2019s as well I did.",
    "She might quite easily have\nkilled Caroline.",
    "I\u2019ve never seen such grief and such frenzied hate.",
    "All the\nveneer of refinement and education was stripped off.",
    "You could see her\nfather and her father\u2019s mother and father had been millhands.",
    "Deprived\nof her lover she was just elemental woman.",
    "She\u2019d have clawed\nCaroline\u2019s face torn her hair hurled her over the parapet if she could.",
    "She thought for some reason or other that Caroline had knifed him.",
    "She\u2019d got it all wrong\u2014naturally.",
    "I held her off and then Miss Williams took charge.",
    "She was good I\nmust say.",
    "She got Elsa to control herself in under a minute\u2014told her\nshe\u2019d got to be quiet and that we couldn\u2019t have this noise and violence\ngoing on.",
    "She was a tartar that woman.",
    "But she did the trick.",
    "Elsa was\nquiet\u2014just stood there gasping and trembling.",
    "As for Caroline so far as I am concerned the mask was right off.",
    "She\nstood there perfectly quiet\u2014you might have said dazed.",
    "But she wasn\u2019t\ndazed.",
    "It was her eyes gave her away.",
    "They were watchful\u2014fully aware\nand quietly watchful.",
    "She\u2019d begun I suppose to be afraid\u2026.",
    "I went up to her and spoke to her.",
    "I said it quite low.",
    "I don\u2019t think\neither of the two women overheard.",
    "I said\n\u201cYou damned murderess you\u2019ve killed my best friend.\u201d\nShe shrank back.",
    "She said\n\u201cNo\u2014oh no\u2014he\u2014he did it himself\u2026.\u201d\nI looked her full in the eyes.",
    "I said\n\u201cYou can tell that story\u2014to the police.\u201d\nShe did\u2014and they didn\u2019t believe her.",
    "End of Philip Blake\u2019s Statement.",
    "Narrative of Meredith Blake\nDear Mr. Poirot\nAs I promised you I have set down in writing an account of all I can\nremember relating to the tragic events that happened sixteen years ago.",
    "First of all I would like to say that I have thought over carefully all you\nsaid to me at our recent meeting.",
    "And on reflection I am more convinced\nthan I was before that it is in the highest degree unlikely that Caroline\nCrale poisoned her husband.",
    "It always seemed incongruous but the\nabsence of any other explanation and her own attitude led me to follow\nsheeplike the opinion of other people and to say with them\u2014that if she\ndidn\u2019t do it what explanation could there be\nSince seeing you I have reflected very carefully on the alternative\nsolution presented at the time and brought forward by the defence at the\ntrial.",
    "That is that Amyas Crale took his own life.",
    "Although from what I\nknew of him that solution seemed quite fantastic at the time I now see fit\nto modify my opinion.",
    "To begin with and highly significant is the fact\nthat Caroline believed it.",
    "If we are now to take it that that charming and\ngentle lady was unjustly convicted then her own frequently reiterated\nbelief must carry great weight.",
    "She knew Amyas better than anyone else.",
    "If she thought suicide possible then suicide must have been possible in\nspite of the scepticism of his friends.",
    "I will advance the theory therefore that there was in Amyas Crale\nsome core of conscience some undercurrent of remorse and even despair\nat the excesses to which his temperament led him of which only his wife\nwas aware.",
    "This I think is a not impossible supposition.",
    "He may have\nshown that side of himself only to her.",
    "Though it is inconsistent with\nanything I ever heard him say yet it is nevertheless a truth that in most\nmen there is some unsuspected and inconsistent streak which often\ncomes as a surprise to people who have known them intimately.",
    "A\nrespected and austere man is discovered to have had a coarser side to his\nlife hidden.",
    "A vulgar moneymaker has perhaps a secret appreciation of\nsome delicate work of art.",
    "Hard and ruthless people have been convicted\nof unsuspected hidden kindnesses.",
    "Generous and jovial men have been\nshown to have a mean and cruel side to them.",
    "So it may be that in Amyas Crale there ran a strain of morbid selfaccusation and that the more he blustered out his egoism and his right to\ndo as he pleased the more strongly that secret conscience of his worked.",
    "It is improbable on the face of it but I now believe that it must have\nbeen so.",
    "And I repeat again Caroline herself held steadfastly to that\nview.",
    "That I repeat is significant\nAnd now to examine facts or rather my memory of facts in the light\nof that new belief.",
    "I think that I might with relevance include here a conversation I held\nwith Caroline some weeks before the actual tragedy.",
    "It was during Elsa\nGreer\u2019s first visit to Alderbury.",
    "Caroline as I have told you was aware of my deep affection and\nfriendship for her.",
    "I was therefore the person in whom she could most\neasily confide.",
    "She had not been looking very happy.",
    "Nevertheless I was\nsurprised when she suddenly asked me one day whether I thought Amyas\nreally cared very much for this girl he had brought down.",
    "I said \u201cHe\u2019s interested in painting her.",
    "You know what Amyas is.\u201d\nShe shook her head and said\n\u201cNo he\u2019s in love with her.\u201d\n\u201cWell\u2014perhaps a little.\u201d\n\u201cA great deal I think.\u201d\nI said \u201cShe is unusually attractive I admit.",
    "And we both know that\nAmyas is susceptible.",
    "But you must know by now my dear that Amyas\nreally only cares for one person\u2014and that is you.",
    "He has these\ninfatuations\u2014but they don\u2019t last.",
    "You are the one person to him and\nthough he behaves badly it does not really affect his feeling for you.\u201d\nCaroline said \u201cThat is what I always used to think.\u201d\n\u201cBelieve me Caro\u201d I said.",
    "\u201cIt is so.\u201d\nShe said \u201cBut this time Merry I\u2019m afraid.",
    "That girl is so\u2014so terribly\nsincere.",
    "She\u2019s so young\u2014and so intense.",
    "I\u2019ve a feeling that this time\u2014\nit\u2019s serious.\u201d\nI said \u201cBut the very fact that she is so young and as you say so\nsincere will protect her.",
    "On the whole women are fair game to Amyas\nbut in the case of a girl like this it will be different.\u201d\nShe said \u201cYes that\u2019s what I\u2019m afraid of\u2014it will be different.\u201d\nAnd she went on.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m thirtyfour you know Merry.",
    "And we\u2019ve been\nmarried ten years.",
    "In looks I can\u2019t hold a candle to this Elsa child and I\nknow it.\u201d\n\n\fI said \u201cBut you know Caroline you know\u2014that Amyas is really\ndevoted to you\u201d\nShe said to that \u201cDoes one ever know with men\u201d And then she\nlaughed a little ruefully and said \u201cI\u2019m a very primitive woman Merry.",
    "I\u2019d like to take a hatchet to that girl.\u201d\nI told her that the child probably didn\u2019t understand in the least what\nshe was doing.",
    "She had a great admiration and hero worship for Amyas\nand she probably didn\u2019t realize at all that Amyas was falling in love with\nher.",
    "Caroline just said to me\n\u201cDear Merry\u201d and began to talk about the garden.",
    "I hoped that she\nwas not going to worry any more about the matter.",
    "Shortly afterwards Elsa went back to London.",
    "Amyas was away too\nfor several weeks.",
    "I had really forgotten all about the business.",
    "And then\nI heard that Elsa was back again at Alderbury in order that Amyas might\nfinish the picture.",
    "I was a little disturbed by the news.",
    "But Caroline when I saw her\nwas not in a communicative mood.",
    "She seemed quite her usual self\u2014not\nworried or upset in any way.",
    "I imagined that everything was all right.",
    "That\u2019s why it was such a shock to me to learn how far the thing had\ngone.",
    "I have told you of my conversations with Crale and with Elsa.",
    "I had\nno opportunity of talking to Caroline.",
    "We were only able to exchange\nthose few words about which I have already told you.",
    "I can see her face now the wide dark eyes and the restrained emotion.",
    "I can still hear her voice as she said\n\u201cEverything\u2019s finished\u2026.\u201d\nI can\u2019t describe to you the infinite desolation she conveyed in those\nwords.",
    "They were a literal statement of truth.",
    "With Amyas\u2019s defection\neverything was finished for her.",
    "That I am convinced was why she took\nthe coniine.",
    "It was a way out.",
    "A way suggested to her by my stupid\ndissertation on the drug.",
    "And the passage I read from the Phaedo gives a\ngracious picture of death.",
    "Here is my present belief.",
    "She took the coniine resolved to end her\nown life when Amyas left her.",
    "He may have seen her take it\u2014or he may\nhave discovered that she had it later.",
    "That discovery acted upon him with terrific force.",
    "He was horrified at\nwhat his actions had led her to contemplate.",
    "But notwithstanding his\n\n\fhorror and remorse he still felt himself incapable of giving up Elsa.",
    "I can\nunderstand that.",
    "Anyone who had fallen in love with her would find it\nalmost impossible to tear himself away.",
    "He could not envisage life without Elsa.",
    "He realized that Caroline\ncould not live without him.",
    "He decided there was only one way out\u2014to\nuse the coniine himself.",
    "And the manner in which he did it might be characteristic of the man\nI think.",
    "His painting was the dearest thing in life to him.",
    "He chose to die\nliterally with his brush in his hand.",
    "And the last thing his eyes would see\nwas the face of the girl he loved so desperately.",
    "He might have thought\ntoo that his death would be the best thing for her\u2026.",
    "I admit that this theory leaves certain curious facts unexplained.",
    "Why\nfor instance were only Caroline\u2019s fingerprints found on the empty\nconiine bottle.",
    "I suggest that after Amyas had handled it all prints got\nsmudged or rubbed off by the soft piles of stuffs that were lying over the\nbottle and that after his death Caroline handled it to see if anyone had\ntouched it.",
    "Surely that is possible and plausible As to the evidence\nabout the fingerprints on the beer bottle the witnesses for the defence\nwere of opinion that a man\u2019s hand might be distorted after taking poison\nand so could manage to grasp a beer bottle in a wholly unnatural way.",
    "One other thing remains to be explained.",
    "Caroline\u2019s own attitude\nthroughout the trial.",
    "But I think I have now seen the cause for that.",
    "It was\nshe who actually took the poison from my laboratory.",
    "It was her\ndetermination to do away with herself that impelled her husband to take\nhis own life instead.",
    "Surely it is not unreasonable to suppose that in a\nmorbid excess of responsibility she considered herself responsible for his\ndeath\u2014that she persuaded herself that she was guilty of murder\u2014though\nnot the kind of murder of which she was being accused\nI think all that could be so.",
    "And if that is the case then surely it will\nbe easy for you to persuade little Carla of the fact And she can marry\nher young man and rest contented that the only thing of which her\nmother was guilty was an impulse no more to take her own life.",
    "All this alas is not what you asked me for\u2014which was an account of\nthe happenings as I remember them.",
    "Let me now repair that omission.",
    "I\nhave already told you fully what happened on the day preceding\nAmyas\u2019s death.",
    "We now come to the day itself.",
    "I had slept very badly\u2014worried by the disastrous turn of events for\nmy friends.",
    "After a long wakeful period whilst I vainly tried to think of\n\n\fsomething helpful I could do to avert the catastrophe I fell into a heavy\nsleep about six a.m.",
    "The bringing of my early tea did not awaken me\nand I finally woke up heavyheaded and unrefreshed about half past nine.",
    "It was shortly after that that I thought I heard movements in the room\nbelow me which was the room I used as a laboratory.",
    "I may say here that actually the sounds were probably caused by a cat\ngetting in.",
    "I found the window sash raised a little way as it had carelessly\nbeen left from the day before.",
    "It was just wide enough to admit the\npassage of a cat.",
    "I merely mention the sounds to explain how I came to\nenter the laboratory.",
    "I went in there as soon as I had dressed and looking along the shelves\nI noticed that the bottle containing the preparation of coniine was slightly\nout of line with the rest.",
    "Having had my eye drawn to it in this way I\nwas startled to see that a considerable quantity of it had gone.",
    "The bottle\nhad been nearly full the day before\u2014now it was nearly empty.",
    "I shut and locked the window and went out locking the door behind\nme.",
    "I was considerably upset and also bewildered.",
    "When startled my\nmental processes are I am afraid somewhat slow.",
    "I was first disturbed then apprehensive and finally definitely\nalarmed.",
    "I questioned the household and they all denied having entered\nthe laboratory at all.",
    "I thought things over a little while longer and then\ndecided to ring up my brother and get his advice.",
    "Philip was quicker than I was.",
    "He saw the seriousness of my\ndiscovery and urged me to come over at once and consult with him.",
    "I went out encountering Miss Williams who had come across from\nthe other side to look for a truant pupil.",
    "I assured her that I had not seen\nAngela and that she had not been to the house.",
    "I think that Miss Williams noticed there was something amiss.",
    "She\nlooked at me rather curiously.",
    "I had no intention however of telling her\nwhat had happened.",
    "I suggested she should try the kitchen garden\u2014\nAngela had a favourite apple tree there\u2014and I myself hurried down to\nthe shore and rowed myself across to the Alderbury side.",
    "My brother was already there waiting for me.",
    "We walked up to the house together by the way you and I went the\nother day.",
    "Having seen the topography you can understand that in\npassing underneath the wall of the Battery garden we were bound to\noverhear anything being said inside it.",
    "Beyond the fact that Caroline and Amyas were engaged in a\ndisagreement of some kind I did not pay much attention to what was\nsaid.",
    "Certainly I overheard no threat of any kind uttered by Caroline.",
    "The\nsubject of discussion was Angela and I presume Caroline was pleading\nfor a respite from the fiat of school.",
    "Amyas however was adamant\nshouting out irritably that it was all settled he\u2019d see to her packing.",
    "The door of the Battery opened just as we drew abreast of it and\nCaroline came out.",
    "She looked disturbed\u2014but not unduly so.",
    "She smiled\nrather absently at me and said they had been discussing Angela.",
    "Elsa\ncame down the path at that minute and as Amyas clearly wanted to get\non with the sitting without interruption from us we went on up the path.",
    "Philip blamed himself severely afterwards for the fact that we did not\ntake immediate action.",
    "But I myself cannot see it the same way.",
    "We had\nno earthly right to assume that such a thing as murder was being\ncontemplated.",
    "Moreover I now believe that it was not contemplated.",
    "It\nwas clear that we should have to adopt some course of action but I still\nmaintain that we were right to talk the matter over carefully first.",
    "It was\nnecessary to find the right thing to do\u2014and once or twice I found myself\nwondering if I had not after all made a mistake.",
    "Had the bottle really\nbeen full the day before as I thought I am not one of those people like\nmy brother Philip who can be cocksure of everything.",
    "One\u2019s memory\ndoes play tricks on one.",
    "How often for instance one is convinced one\nhas put an article in a certain place later to find that you have put it\nsomewhere quite different.",
    "The more I tried to recall the state of the\nbottle on the preceding afternoon the more uncertain and doubtful I\nbecame.",
    "This was very annoying to Philip who began completely to lose\npatience with me.",
    "We were not able to continue our discussion at the time and tacitly\nagreed to postpone it until after lunch.",
    "I may say that I was always free\nto drop in for lunch at Alderbury if I chose.",
    "Later Angela and Caroline brought us beer.",
    "I asked Angela what she\nhad been up to playing truant and told her Miss Williams was on the\nwarpath and she said she had been bathing\u2014and added that she didn\u2019t\nsee why she should have to mend her horrible old skirt when she was\ngoing to have all new things to go to school with.",
    "Since there seemed no chance of further talk with Philip alone and\nsince I was really anxious to think things out by myself I wandered off\n\n\fdown the path towards the Battery.",
    "Just above the Battery as I showed\nyou there is a clearing in the trees where there used to be an old bench.",
    "I\nsat there smoking and thinking and watching Elsa as she sat posing for\nAmyas.",
    "I shall always think of her as she was that day.",
    "Rigid in the pose with\nher yellow shirt and darkblue trousers and a red pullover slung round\nher shoulders for warmth.",
    "Her face was so alight with life and health and radiance.",
    "And that gay\nvoice of hers reciting plans for the future.",
    "This sounds as though I was eavesdropping but that is not so.",
    "I was\nperfectly visible to Elsa.",
    "Both she and Amyas knew I was there.",
    "She\nwaved her hand at me and called up that Amyas was a perfect bear that\nmorning\u2014he wouldn\u2019t let her rest.",
    "She was stiff and aching all over.",
    "Amyas growled out that she wasn\u2019t as stiff as he was.",
    "He was stiff all\nover\u2014muscular rheumatism.",
    "Elsa said mockingly \u201cPoor old man\u201d And\nhe said she\u2019d be taking on a creaking invalid.",
    "It shocked me you know their lighthearted acquiescence in their\nfuture together whilst they were causing so much suffering.",
    "And yet I\ncouldn\u2019t hold it against her.",
    "She was so young so confident so very\nmuch in love.",
    "And she didn\u2019t really know what she was doing.",
    "She didn\u2019t\nunderstand suffering.",
    "She just assumed with the na\u00efve confidence of a\nchild that Caroline would be \u201call right\u201d that \u201cshe\u2019d soon get over it.\u201d\nShe saw nothing you see but herself and Amyas\u2014happy together.",
    "She\u2019d already told me my point of view was oldfashioned.",
    "She had no\ndoubts no qualms\u2014no pity either.",
    "But can one expect pity from radiant\nyouth It is an older wiser emotion.",
    "They didn\u2019t talk very much of course.",
    "No painter wants to be\nchattering when he is working.",
    "Perhaps every ten minutes or so Elsa\nwould make an observation and Amyas would grunt a reply.",
    "Once she\nsaid\n\u201cI think you\u2019re right about Spain.",
    "That\u2019s the first place we\u2019ll go to.",
    "And you must take me to see a bullfight.",
    "It must be wonderful.",
    "Only I\u2019d\nlike the bull to kill the man\u2014not the other way about.",
    "I understand how\nRoman women felt when they saw a man die.",
    "Men aren\u2019t much but\nanimals are splendid.\u201d\nI suppose she was rather like an animal herself\u2014young and primitive\nand with nothing yet of man\u2019s sad experience and doubtful wisdom.",
    "I\n\n\fdon\u2019t believe Elsa had begun to think\u2014she only felt.",
    "But she was very\nmuch alive\u2014more alive than any person I have ever known\u2026.",
    "That was the last time I saw her radiant and assured\u2014on top of the\nworld.",
    "Fey is the word for it isn\u2019t it\nThe bell sounded for lunch and I got up and went down the path and\nin at the Battery door and Elsa joined me.",
    "It was dazzlingly bright there\ncoming in out of the shady trees.",
    "I could hardly see.",
    "Amyas was\nsprawled back on the seat his arms flung out.",
    "He was staring at the\npicture.",
    "I\u2019ve so often seen him like that.",
    "How was I to know that already\nthe poison was working stiffening him as he sat\nHe so hated and resented illness.",
    "He would never own to it.",
    "I dare say\nhe thought he had got a touch of the sun\u2014the symptoms are much the\nsame\u2014but he\u2019d be the last person to complain about it.",
    "Elsa said\n\u201cHe won\u2019t come up to lunch.\u201d\nPrivately I thought he was wise.",
    "I said\n\u201cSo long then.\u201d\nHe moved his eyes from the picture until they rested on me.",
    "There\nwas a queer\u2014how shall I describe it\u2014it looked like malevolence.",
    "A kind\nof malevolent glare.",
    "Naturally I didn\u2019t understand it then\u2014if his picture wasn\u2019t going as\nhe liked he often looked quite murderous.",
    "I thought that was what it was.",
    "He made a sort of grunting sound.",
    "Neither Elsa nor I saw anything unusual in him\u2014just artistic\ntemperament.",
    "So we left him there and she and I went up to the house laughing and\ntalking.",
    "If she\u2019d known poor child that she\u2019d never see him alive\nagain\u2026Oh well thank God she didn\u2019t.",
    "She was able to be happy a little\nlonger.",
    "Caroline was quite normal at lunch\u2014a little preoccupied nothing\nmore.",
    "And doesn\u2019t that show that she had nothing to do with it She\ncouldn\u2019t have been such an actress.",
    "She and the governess went down afterwards and found him.",
    "I met\nMiss Williams as she came up.",
    "She told me to telephone a doctor and\nwent back to Caroline.",
    "That poor child\u2014Elsa I mean She had that frantic unrestrained grief\nthat a child has.",
    "They can\u2019t believe that life can do these things to them.",
    "Caroline was quite calm.",
    "Yes she was quite calm.",
    "She was able of\n\n\fcourse to control herself better than Elsa.",
    "She didn\u2019t seem remorseful\u2014\nthen.",
    "Just said he must have done it himself.",
    "And we couldn\u2019t believe\nthat.",
    "Elsa burst out and accused her to her face.",
    "Of course she may have realized already that she herself would be\nsuspected.",
    "Yes that probably explains her manner.",
    "Philip was quite convinced that she had done it.",
    "The governess was a great help and standby.",
    "She made Elsa lie down\nand gave her a sedative and she kept Angela out of the way when the\npolice came.",
    "Yes she was a tower of strength that woman.",
    "The whole thing became a nightmare.",
    "The police searching the house\nand asking questions and then the reporters swarming about the place\nlike flies and clicking cameras and wanting interviews with members of\nthe family.",
    "A nightmare the whole thing\u2026.",
    "It\u2019s a nightmare after all these years.",
    "Please God once you\u2019ve\nconvinced little Carla what really happened we can forget it all and\nnever remember it again.",
    "Amyas must have committed suicide\u2014however unlikely it seems.",
    "End of Meredith Blake\u2019s Narrative.",
    "Narrative of Lady Dittisham\nI have set down here the full story of my meeting with Amyas Crale up\nto the time of his tragic death.",
    "I saw him first at a studio party.",
    "He was standing I remember by a\nwindow and I saw him as I came in at the door.",
    "I asked who he was.",
    "Someone said \u201cThat\u2019s Crale the painter.\u201d I said at once that I\u2019d like to\nmeet him.",
    "We talked on that occasion for perhaps ten minutes.",
    "When anyone\nmakes the impression on you that Amyas Crale made on me it\u2019s\nhopeless to attempt to describe them.",
    "If I say that when I saw Amyas\nCrale everybody else seemed to grow very small and fade away that\nexpresses it as well as anything can.",
    "Immediately after that meeting I went to look at as many of his\npictures as I could.",
    "He had a show on in Bond Street at the moment and\nthere was one of his pictures in Manchester and one in Leeds and two in\npublic galleries in London.",
    "I went to see them all.",
    "Then I met him again.",
    "I said \u201cI\u2019ve been to see all your pictures.",
    "I think they\u2019re wonderful.\u201d\nHe just looked amused.",
    "He said\n\u201cWho said you were any judge of painting I don\u2019t believe you know\nanything about it.\u201d\nI said \u201cPerhaps not.",
    "But they are marvellous all the same.\u201d\nHe grinned at me and said \u201cDon\u2019t be a gushing little fool.\u201d\nI said \u201cI\u2019m not.",
    "I want you to paint me.\u201d\nCrale said \u201cIf you\u2019ve any sense at all you\u2019ll realize that I don\u2019t paint\nportraits of pretty women.\u201d\nI said \u201cIt needn\u2019t be a portrait and I\u2019m not a pretty woman.\u201d\nHe looked at me then as though he\u2019d begun to see me.",
    "He said \u201cNo\nperhaps you\u2019re not.\u201d\nI said \u201cWill you paint me then\u201d\nHe studied me for some time with his head on one side.",
    "Then he said\n\u201cYou\u2019re a strange child aren\u2019t you\u201d\nI said \u201cI\u2019m quite rich you know.",
    "I can afford to pay well for it.\u201d\nHe said \u201cWhy are you so anxious for me to paint you\u201d\nI said \u201cBecause I want it\u201d\nHe said \u201cIs that a reason\u201d\n\n\fAnd I said \u201cYes I always get what I want.\u201d\nHe said then \u201cOh my poor child how young you are\u201d\nI said \u201cWill you paint me\u201d\nHe took me by the shoulders and turned me towards the light and\nlooked me over.",
    "Then he stood away from me a little.",
    "I stood quite still\nwaiting.",
    "He said \u201cI\u2019ve sometimes wanted to paint a flight of impossiblycoloured Australian Maccaws alighting on St. Paul\u2019s Cathedral.",
    "If I\npainted you against a nice traditional bit of outdoor landscape I believe\nI\u2019d get exactly the same result.\u201d\nI said \u201cThen you will paint me\u201d\nHe said \u201cYou\u2019re one of the loveliest crudest most flamboyant bits of\nexotic colouring I\u2019ve ever seen.",
    "I\u2019ll paint you\u201d\nI said \u201cThen that\u2019s settled.\u201d\nHe went on \u201cBut I\u2019ll warn you Elsa Greer.",
    "If I do paint you I shall\nprobably make love to you.\u201d\nI said \u201cI hope you will\u2026.\u201d\nI said it quite steadily and quietly.",
    "I heard him catch his breath and I\nsaw the look that came into his eyes.",
    "You see it was as sudden as all that.",
    "A day or two later we met again.",
    "He told me that he wanted me to\ncome down to Devonshire\u2014he\u2019d got the very place there that he wanted\nfor a background.",
    "He said\n\u201cI\u2019m married you know.",
    "And I\u2019m very fond of my wife.\u201d\nI said if he was fond of her she must be very nice.",
    "He said she was extremely nice.",
    "\u201cIn fact\u201d he said \u201cshe\u2019s quite\nadorable\u2014and I adore her.",
    "So put that in your pipe young Elsa and\nsmoke it.\u201d\nI told him that I quite understood.",
    "He began the picture a week later.",
    "Caroline Crale welcomed me very\npleasantly.",
    "She didn\u2019t like me much\u2014but after all why should she\nAmyas was very circumspect.",
    "He never said a word to me that his wife\ncouldn\u2019t have overheard and I was quite polite and formal to him.",
    "Underneath though we both knew.",
    "After ten days he told me I was to go back to London.",
    "I said \u201cThe picture isn\u2019t finished.\u201d\nHe said \u201cIt\u2019s barely begun.",
    "The truth is I can\u2019t paint you Elsa.\u201d\nI said \u201cWhy\u201d\n\n\fHe said \u201cYou know well enough why Elsa.",
    "And that\u2019s why you\u2019ve\ngot to clear out.",
    "I can\u2019t think about the painting\u2014I can\u2019t think about\nanything but you.\u201d\nWe were in the Battery garden.",
    "It was a hot sunny day.",
    "There were\nbirds and humming bees.",
    "It ought to have been very happy and peaceful.",
    "But it didn\u2019t feel like that.",
    "It felt\u2014somehow\u2014tragic.",
    "As though\u2014as\nthough what was going to happen was already mirrored there.",
    "I knew it would be no good my going back to London but I said\n\u201cVery well I\u2019ll go if you say so.\u201d\nAmyas said \u201cGood girl.\u201d\nSo I went.",
    "I didn\u2019t write to him.",
    "He held out for ten days and then he came.",
    "He was so thin and\nhaggard and miserable that it shocked me.",
    "He said \u201cI warned you Elsa.",
    "Don\u2019t say I didn\u2019t warn you.\u201d\nI said \u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for you.",
    "I knew you\u2019d come.\u201d\nHe gave a sort of groan and said \u201cThere are things that are too strong\nfor any man.",
    "I can\u2019t eat or sleep or rest for wanting you.\u201d\nI said I knew that and that it was the same with me and had been\nfrom the first moment I\u2019d seen him.",
    "It was Fate and it was no use\nstruggling against it.",
    "He said \u201cYou haven\u2019t struggled much have you Elsa\u201d And I said I\nhadn\u2019t struggled at all.",
    "He said he wished I wasn\u2019t so young and I said that didn\u2019t matter.",
    "I\nsuppose I might say that for the next few weeks we were very happy.",
    "But\nhappiness isn\u2019t quite the word.",
    "It was something deeper and more\nfrightening than that.",
    "We were made for each other and we\u2019d found each other\u2014and we\nboth knew we\u2019d got to be together always.",
    "But something else happened too.",
    "The unfinished picture began to\nhaunt Amyas.",
    "He said to me \u201cDamned funny I couldn\u2019t paint you\nbefore\u2014you yourself got in the way of it.",
    "But I want to paint you Elsa.",
    "I\nwant to paint you so that that picture will be the finest thing I\u2019ve ever\ndone.",
    "I\u2019m itching and aching now to get at my brushes to see you sitting\nthere on that hoary old chestnut of a battlement wall with the\nconventional blue sea and the decorous English trees\u2014and you\u2014you\u2014\nsitting there like a discordant shriek of triumph.\u201d\nHe said \u201cAnd I\u2019ve got to paint you that way And I can\u2019t be fussed\nand bothered while I\u2019m doing it.",
    "When the picture\u2019s finished I\u2019ll tell\n\n\fCaroline the truth and we\u2019ll get the whole messy business cleared up.\u201d\nI said \u201cWill Caroline make a fuss about divorcing you\u201d\nHe said he didn\u2019t think so.",
    "But you never knew with women.",
    "I said I was sorry if she was going to be upset but after all I said\nthese things did happen.",
    "He said \u201cVery nice and reasonable Elsa.",
    "But Caroline isn\u2019t\nreasonable never has been reasonable and certainly isn\u2019t going to feel\nreasonable.",
    "She loves me you know.\u201d\nI said I understood that but if she loved him she\u2019d put his happiness\nfirst and at any rate she wouldn\u2019t want to keep him if he wanted to be\nfree.",
    "He said \u201cLife can\u2019t really be solved by admirable maxims out of\nmodern literature.",
    "Nature\u2019s red in tooth and claw remember.\u201d\nI said \u201cSurely we are all civilized people nowadays\u201d and Amyas\nlaughed.",
    "He said \u201cCivilized people my foot Caroline would probably\nlike to take a hatchet to you.",
    "She might do it too.",
    "Don\u2019t you realize Elsa\nthat she\u2019s going to suffer\u2014suffer Don\u2019t you know what suffering\nmeans\u201d\nI said \u201cThen don\u2019t tell her.\u201d\nHe said \u201cNo.",
    "The break\u2019s got to come.",
    "You\u2019ve got to belong to me\nproperly Elsa.",
    "Before all the world.",
    "Openly mine.\u201d\nI said \u201cSuppose she won\u2019t divorce you\u201d\nHe said \u201cI\u2019m not afraid of that.\u201d\nI said \u201cWhat are you afraid of then\u201d\nAnd then he said slowly \u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026.\u201d\nYou see he knew Caroline.",
    "I didn\u2019t.",
    "If I\u2019d had any idea\u2026.",
    "We went down again to Alderbury.",
    "Things were difficult this time.",
    "Caroline had got suspicious.",
    "I didn\u2019t like it\u2014I didn\u2019t like it\u2014I didn\u2019t like\nit a bit.",
    "I\u2019ve always hated deceit and concealment.",
    "I thought we ought to\ntell her.",
    "Amyas wouldn\u2019t hear of it.",
    "The funny part of it was that he didn\u2019t really care at all.",
    "In spite of\nbeing fond of Caroline and not wanting to hurt her he just didn\u2019t care\nabout the honesty or dishonesty of it all.",
    "He was painting with a kind of\nfrenzy and nothing else mattered.",
    "I hadn\u2019t seen him in one of his\nworking spells before.",
    "I realized now what a really great genius he was.",
    "It was natural for him to be so carried away that all the ordinary\ndecencies didn\u2019t matter.",
    "But it was different for me.",
    "I was in a horrible\n\n\fposition.",
    "Caroline resented me\u2014and quite rightly.",
    "The only thing to put\nthe position quite straight was to be honest and tell her the truth.",
    "But all Amyas would say was that he wasn\u2019t going to be bothered\nwith scenes and fusses until he\u2019d finished the picture.",
    "I said there\nprobably wouldn\u2019t be a scene.",
    "Caroline would have too much dignity and\npride for that.",
    "I said \u201cI want to be honest about it all.",
    "We\u2019ve got to be honest\u201d\nAmyas said \u201cTo hell with honesty.",
    "I\u2019m painting a picture damn it.\u201d\nI did see his point of view but he wouldn\u2019t see mine.",
    "And in the end I broke down.",
    "Caroline had been talking of some plan\nshe and Amyas were going to carry out next autumn.",
    "She talked about it\nquite confidently.",
    "And I suddenly felt it was too abominable what we\nwere doing\u2014letting her go on like this\u2014and perhaps too I was angry\nbecause she was really being very unpleasant to me in a clever sort of\nway that one couldn\u2019t take hold of.",
    "And so I came out with the truth.",
    "In a way I still think I was right.",
    "Though of course I wouldn\u2019t have done it if I\u2019d had the faintest idea\nwhat was to come of it.",
    "The clash came right away.",
    "Amyas was furious with me but he had to\nadmit that what I had said was true.",
    "I didn\u2019t understand Caroline at all.",
    "We all went over to Meredith\nBlake\u2019s to tea and Caroline played up marvellously\u2014talking and\nlaughing.",
    "Like a fool I thought she was taking it well.",
    "It was awkward\nmy not being able to leave the house but Amyas would have gone up in\nsmoke if I had.",
    "I thought perhaps Caroline would go.",
    "It would have made\nit much easier for us if she had.",
    "I didn\u2019t see her take the coniine.",
    "I want to be honest so I think that it\u2019s\njust possible that she may have taken it as she said she did with the idea\nof suicide in her mind.",
    "But I don\u2019t really think so.",
    "I think she was one of those intensely\njealous and possessive women who won\u2019t let go of anything that they\nthink belongs to them.",
    "Amyas was her property.",
    "I think she was quite\nprepared to kill him rather than to let him go\u2014completely and finally\u2014\nto another woman.",
    "I think she made up her mind right away to kill him.",
    "And I think that Meredith\u2019s happening to discuss coniine so freely just\ngave her the means to do what she\u2019d already made up her mind to do.",
    "She was a very bitter and revengeful woman\u2014vindictive.",
    "Amyas knew\nall along that she was dangerous.",
    "I didn\u2019t.",
    "The next morning she had a final showdown with Amyas.",
    "I heard\nmost of it from the outside on the terrace.",
    "He was splendid\u2014very patient\nand calm.",
    "He implored her to be reasonable.",
    "He said he was very fond of\nher and the child and always would be.",
    "He\u2019d do everything he could do\nto assure their future.",
    "Then he hardened up and said \u201cBut understand\nthis.",
    "I\u2019m damned well going to marry Elsa\u2014and nothing shall stop me.",
    "You and I always agreed to leave each other free.",
    "These things happen.\u201d\nCaroline said to him \u201cDo as you please.",
    "I\u2019ve warned you.\u201d\nHer voice was very quiet but there was a queer note in it.",
    "Amyas said \u201cWhat do you mean Caroline\u201d\nShe said \u201cYou\u2019re mine and I don\u2019t mean to let you go.",
    "Sooner than let\nyou go to that girl I\u2019ll kill you\u2026.\u201d\nJust at that minute Philip Blake came along the terrace.",
    "I got up and\nwent to meet him.",
    "I didn\u2019t want him to overhear.",
    "Presently Amyas came out and said it was time to get on with the\npicture.",
    "We went down together to the Battery.",
    "He didn\u2019t say much.",
    "Just\nsaid that Caroline was cutting up rough\u2014but for God\u2019s sake not to talk\nabout it.",
    "He wanted to concentrate on what he was doing.",
    "Another day\nhe said would about finish the picture.",
    "He said \u201cAnd it\u2019ll be the best thing I\u2019ve ever done Elsa even if it is\npaid for in blood and tears.\u201d\nA little later I went up to the house to get a pullover.",
    "There was a\nchilly wind blowing.",
    "When I came back again Caroline was there.",
    "I\nsuppose she had come down to make one last appeal.",
    "Philip and\nMeredith Blake were there too.",
    "It was then that Amyas said he was thirsty and wanted a drink.",
    "He\nsaid there was beer but it wasn\u2019t iced.",
    "Caroline said she\u2019d send him down some iced beer.",
    "She said it quite\nnaturally in an almost friendly tone.",
    "She was an actress that woman.",
    "She\nmust have known then what she meant to do.",
    "She brought it down about ten minutes later.",
    "Amyas was painting.",
    "She poured it out and set the glass down beside him.",
    "Neither of us were\nwatching her.",
    "Amyas was intent on what he was doing and I had to keep\nthe pose.",
    "Amyas drank it down the way he always drank beer just pouring it\ndown his throat in one draught.",
    "Then he made a face and said it tasted\nfoul\u2014but at any rate it was cold.",
    "And even then when he said that no suspicion entered my head I\njust laughed and said \u201cLiver.\u201d\nWhen she\u2019d seen him drink it Caroline went away.",
    "It must have been about forty minutes later that Amyas complained of\nstiffness and pains.",
    "He said he thought he must have got a touch of\nmuscular rheumatism.",
    "Amyas was always intolerant of any ailment and\nhe didn\u2019t like being fussed over.",
    "After saying that he turned it off with a\nlight \u201cOld age I suppose.",
    "You\u2019ve taken on a creaking old man Elsa.\u201d I\nplayed up to him.",
    "But I noticed that his legs moved stiffly and queerly\nand that he grimaced once or twice.",
    "I never dreamt that it wasn\u2019t\nrheumatism.",
    "Presently he drew the bench along and sat sprawled on that\noccasionally stretching up to put a touch of paint here and there on the\ncanvas.",
    "He used to do that sometimes when he was painting.",
    "Just sit\nstaring at me and then the canvas.",
    "Sometimes he\u2019d do it for half an hour\nat a time.",
    "So I didn\u2019t think it specially queer.",
    "We heard the bell go for lunch and he said he wasn\u2019t coming up.",
    "He\u2019d stay where he was and he didn\u2019t want anything.",
    "That wasn\u2019t\nunusual either and it would be easier for him than facing Caroline at the\ntable.",
    "He was talking in rather a queer way\u2014grunting out his words.",
    "But he\nsometimes did that when he was dissatisfied with the progress of the\npicture.",
    "Meredith Blake came in to fetch me.",
    "He spoke to Amyas but Amyas\nonly grunted at him.",
    "We went up to the house together and left him there.",
    "We left him\nthere\u2014to die alone.",
    "I\u2019d never seen much illness\u2014I didn\u2019t know much\nabout it\u2014I thought Amyas was just in a painter\u2019s mood.",
    "If I\u2019d known\u2014\nif I\u2019d realized\u2014perhaps a doctor could have saved him\u2026Oh God why\ndidn\u2019t I\u2014it\u2019s no good thinking of that now.",
    "I was a blind fool.",
    "A blind\nstupid fool.",
    "There isn\u2019t much more to tell.",
    "Caroline and the governess went down there after lunch.",
    "Meredith\nfollowed them.",
    "Presently he came running up.",
    "He told us Amyas was\ndead.",
    "Then I knew Knew I mean that it was Caroline.",
    "I still didn\u2019t think\nof poison.",
    "I thought she\u2019d gone down that minute and either shot him or\nstabbed him.",
    "I wanted to get at her\u2014to kill her\u2026.",
    "How could she do it How could she He was so alive so full of life\nand vigour.",
    "To put all that out\u2014to make him limp and cold.",
    "Just so that I\nshouldn\u2019t have him.",
    "Horrible woman\u2026.",
    "Horrible scornful cruel vindictive woman\u2026.",
    "I hate her.",
    "I still hate her.",

    "They ought to have hanged her\u2026.",
    "Even hanging was too good for her\u2026.",
    "I hate her\u2026I hate her\u2026I hate her\u2026.",

    "I took up my duties at Alderbury a very beautiful estate in south\nDevon which had belonged to Mr. Crale\u2019s family for many generations.",
    "I\nknew that Mr. Crale was a wellknown painter but I did not meet him\nuntil I took up residence at Alderbury.",

    "I found my pupil an interesting and promising character.",
    "She had very\nmarked abilities and it was a pleasure to teach her.",
    "She was somewhat\nwild and undisciplined but these faults arose mainly through high spirits\nand I have always preferred my girls to show spirit.",
    "An excess of vitality\ncan be trained and guided into paths of real usefulness and achievement.",
    "On the whole I found Angela amenable to discipline.",
    "She had been\nsomewhat spoiled\u2014mainly by Mrs. Crale who was far too indulgent\nwhere she was concerned.",
    "Mr. Crale\u2019s influence was I considered\nunwise.",
    "He indulged her absurdly one day and was unnecessarily\nperemptory on another occasion.",
    "He was very much a man of moods\u2014\npossibly owing to what is styled the artistic temperament.",
    "I have never seen myself why the possession of artistic ability\nshould be supposed to excuse a man from a decent exercise of selfcontrol.",
    "I did not myself admire Mr. Crale\u2019s paintings.",
    "The drawing\n\n\fseemed to me faulty and the colouring exaggerated but naturally I was\nnot called upon to express any opinion on these matters.",
    "I soon formed a deep attachment to Mrs. Crale.",
    "I admired her\ncharacter and her fortitude in the difficulties of her life.",
    "Mr. Crale was\nnot a faithful husband and I think that that fact was the source of much\npain to her.",
    "A strongerminded woman would have left him but Mrs.\nCrale never seemed to contemplate such a course.",
    "She endured his\ninfidelities and forgave him for them\u2014but I may say that she did not\ntake them meekly.",
    "She remonstrated\u2014and with spirit\nIt was said at the trial that they led a cat and dog life.",
    "I would not go\nas far as that\u2014Mrs.",
    "Crale had too much dignity for that term to apply\nbut they did have quarrels.",

    "She arrived down at Alderbury in the summer\nof 19\u2026Mrs.",
    "Crale had not met her previously.",
    "She was Mr. Crale\u2019s\nfriend and she was said to be there for the purpose of having her portrait\npainted.",
    "It was apparent at once that Mr. Crale was infatuated with this girl\nand that the girl herself was doing nothing to discourage him.",
    "She\nbehaved in my opinion quite outrageously being abominably rude to\nMrs. Crale and openly flirting with Mr. Crale.",
    "Naturally Mrs. Crale said nothing to me but I could see that she was\ndisturbed and unhappy and I did everything in my power to distract her\nmind and lighten her burden.",
    "Miss Greer sat every day to Mr. Crale but I\nnoticed that the picture was not getting on very fast.",
    "They had no doubt\nother things to talk about\nMy pupil I am thankful to say noticed very little of what was going\non.",
    "Angela was in some ways young for her age.",
    "Though her intellect\nwas well developed she was not at all what I may term precocious.",
    "She\nseemed to have no wish to read undesirable books and showed no signs\nof morbid curiosity such as girls often do at her age.",
    "She therefore saw nothing undesirable in the friendship between Mr.\nCrale and Miss Greer.",
    "Nevertheless she disliked Miss Greer and thought\nher stupid.",
    "Here she was quite right.",
    "Miss Greer had had I presume a\nproper education but she never opened a book and was quite unfamiliar\nwith current literary allusions.",
    "Moreover she could not sustain a\ndiscussion on any intellectual subject.",

    "She was also a passionate reader and showed excellent taste in what she\nliked and disliked.",
    "Mrs. Crale was always careful to conceal any signs of unhappiness\nfrom Angela and exerted herself to appear bright and cheerful when the\ngirl was about.",
    "Miss Greer went back to London\u2014at which I can tell you we were\nall very pleased The servants disliked her as much as I did.",
    "She was the\nkind of person who gives a lot of unnecessary trouble and forgets to say\nthank you.",

    "I was very sorry for Mrs. Crale.",
    "She felt these\nthings very keenly.",

    "When a\nman has a charming gracious intelligent wife he\u2019s no business to treat\nher badly.",
    "However she and I both hoped the affair would soon be over.",
    "Not\nthat we mentioned the subject to each other\u2014we did not\u2014but she knew\nquite well how I felt about it.",
    "Unfortunately after some weeks the pair of them reappeared.",
    "It\nseemed the sittings were to be resumed.",
    "Mr. Crale was now painting with absolute frenzy.",
    "He seemed less\npreoccupied with the girl than with his picture of her.",
    "Nevertheless I\nrealized that this was not the usual kind of thing we had gone through\nbefore.",
    "This girl had got her claws into him and she meant business.",
    "He\nwas just like wax in her hands.",
    "The thing came to a head on the day before he died\u2014that is on Sept.\n17.",

    "She was feeling sure of herself and she wanted to assert her importance.",
    "Mrs. Crale behaved like a true gentlewoman.",
    "She was icily polite but\nshe showed the other clearly what she thought of her.",
    "On this day Sept. 17 as we were sitting in the drawing room after\nlunch Miss Greer came out with an amazing remark as to how she was\ngoing to redecorate the room when she was living at Alderbury.",
    "Naturally Mrs. Crale couldn\u2019t let that pass.",
    "She challenged her and\nMiss Greer had the impudence to say before us all that she was going to\nmarry Mr. Crale.",
    "She actually talked about marrying a married man\u2014\nand she said it to his wife\nI was very very angry with Mr. Crale.",
    "How dared he let this girl\ninsult his wife in her own drawing room If he wanted to run away with\nthe girl he should have gone off with her not brought her into his wife\u2019s\nhouse and backed her up in her insolence.",
    "In spite of what she must have felt Mrs. Crale did not lose her\ndignity.",
    "Her husband came in just then and she immediately demanded\nconfirmation from him.",
    "He was not unnaturally annoyed with Miss Greer for her\nunconsidered forcing of the situation.",
    "Apart from anything else it made\nhim appear at a disadvantage and men do not like appearing at a\ndisadvantage.",
    "It upsets their vanity.",
    "He stood there a great giant of a man looking as sheepish and foolish\nas a naughty schoolboy.",
    "It was his wife who carried off the honours of\nthe situation.",
    "He had to mutter foolishly that it was true but that he\nhadn\u2019t meant her to learn it like this.",
    "I have never seen anything like the look of scorn she gave him.",
    "She\nwent out of the room with her head held high.",
    "She was a beautiful\nwoman\u2014much more beautiful than that flamboyant girl\u2014and she\nwalked like an Empress.",
    "I hoped with all my heart that Amyas Crale would be punished for\nthe cruelty he had displayed and for the indignity he had put upon a longsuffering and noble woman.",
    "For the first time I tried to say something of what I felt to Mrs. Crale\nbut she stopped me.",
    "She said\n\u201cWe must try and behave as usual.",
    "It\u2019s the best way.",
    "We\u2019re all going\nover to Meredith Blake\u2019s to tea.\u201d\nI said to her then\n\u201cI think you are wonderful Mrs. Crale.\u201d\nShe said\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know\u2026.\u201d\nThen as she was going out of the room she came back and kissed\nme.",
    "She said\n\u201cYou\u2019re such a comfort to me.\u201d\n\n\fShe went to her room then and I think she cried.",
    "I saw her when they\nall started off.",

    "They brought up the old school question again.",
    "He\nwas irritable and on edge and she was unusually trying.",
    "The whole\nmatter was settled and her outfit had been bought and there was no sense\nin starting up an argument again but she suddenly chose to make a\ngrievance of it.",
    "I have no doubt she sensed the tension in the air and that\nit reacted on her as much as on everybody else.",

    "I resented the power she had over me and tried to\nstifle the attraction she had for me by constantly dwelling on her worst\n\n\fpoints.",
    "I never liked her if you understand.",
    "But it would have been easy\nat any moment for me to make love to her.",
    "I had been in love with her as\na boy and she had taken no notice of me.",
    "I did not find that easy to\nforgive.",
    "\u201cMy opportunity came when Amyas lost his head so completely over\nthe Greer girl.",
    "Quite without meaning to I found myself telling Caroline I\nloved her.",
    "She said quite calmly \u201cYes I have always known that.\u201d The\ninsolence of the woman\n\u201cOf course I knew that she didn\u2019t love me but I saw that she was\ndisturbed and disillusioned by Amyas\u2019s present infatuation.",
    "That is a\nmood when a woman can very easily be won.",
    "She agreed to come to me\nthat night.",
    "And she came.\u201d\nBlake paused.",
    "He found now a difficulty in getting the words out.",
    "\u201cShe came to my room.",
    "And then with my arms round her she told\nme quite coolly that it was no good After all she said she was a oneman woman.",
    "She was Amyas Crale\u2019s for better or worse.",
    "She agreed\nthat she had treated me very badly but said she couldn\u2019t help it.",
    "She\nasked me to forgive her.",
    "\u201cAnd she left me.",
    "She left me Do you wonder Mr. Poirot that my\nhatred of her was heightened a hundredfold Do you wonder that I have\nnever forgiven her For the insult she did me\u2014as well as for the fact that\nshe killed the friend I loved better than anyone in the world\u201d\nTrembling violently Philip Blake exclaimed\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to speak of it do you hear You\u2019ve got your answer.",
    "Now go And never mention the matter to me again\u201d\n\nII\n\u201cI want to know Mr. Blake the order in which your guests left the\nlaboratory that day\u201d\nMeredith Blake protested.",
    "\u201cBut my dear Mr. Poirot.",
    "After sixteen years How can I possibly\nremember I\u2019ve told you that Caroline came out last.\u201d\n\u201cYou are sure of that\u201d\n\u201cYes\u2014at least\u2014I think so\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cLet us go there now.",
    "We must be quite sure you see.\u201d\nStill protesting Meredith Blake led the way.",
    "He unlocked the door\nand swung back the shutters.",
    "Poirot spoke to him authoritatively.",
    "\u201cNow then my friend.",
    "You have showed your visitors your\ninteresting preparations of herbs.",
    "Shut your eyes now and think\u2014\u201d\nMeredith Blake did so obediently.",
    "Poirot drew a handkerchief from\nhis pocket and gently passed it to and fro.",
    "Blake murmured his nostrils\ntwitching slightly\n\u201cYes yes\u2014extraordinary how things come back to one.",
    "Caroline I\nremember had on a pale coffeecoloured dress.",
    "Phil was looking\nbored\u2026He always thought my hobby was quite idiotic.\u201d\nPoirot said\n\u201cReflect now you are about to leave the room.",
    "You are going to the\nlibrary where you are going to read the passage about the death of\nSocrates.",
    "Who leaves the room first\u2014do you\u201d\n\u201cElsa and I\u2014yes.",
    "She passed through the door first.",
    "I was close\nbehind her.",
    "We were talking.",
    "I stood there waiting for the others to come\nso that I could lock the door again.",
    "Philip\u2014yes Philip came out next.",
    "And Angela\u2014she was asking him what bulls and bears were.",
    "They went\non through the hall.",
    "Amyas followed them.",
    "I stood there waiting still\u2014\nfor Caroline of course.\u201d\n\u201cSo you are quite sure Caroline stayed behind.",
    "Did you see what she\nwas doing\u201d\nBlake shook his head.",
    "\u201cNo I had my back to the room you see.",
    "I was talking to Elsa\u2014\nboring her I expect\u2014telling her how certain plants must be gathered at\nthe full of the moon according to old superstition.",
    "And then Caroline\ncame out\u2014hurrying a little\u2014and I locked the door.\u201d\nHe stopped and looked at Poirot who was replacing a handkerchief in\nhis pocket.",
    "Meredith Blake sniffled disgustedly and thought \u201cWhy the\nfellow actually uses scent\u201d\nAloud he said\n\u201cI am quite sure of it.",
    "That was the order.",
    "Elsa myself Philip Angela\nand Caroline.",
    "Does that help you at all\u201d\nPoirot said\n\u201cIt all fits in.",
    "Listen.",
    "I want to arrange a meeting here.",
    "It will not I\nthink be difficult\u2026.\u201d\n\nIII\n\u201cWell\u201d\n\n\fElsa Dittisham said it almost eagerly\u2014like a child.",
    "\u201cI want to ask you a question madame.\u201d\n\u201cYes\u201d\nPoirot said\n\u201cAfter it was all over\u2014the trial I mean\u2014did Meredith Blake ask you\nto marry him\u201d\nElsa stared.",
    "She looked contemptuous\u2014almost bored.",
    "\u201cYes\u2014he did.",
    "Why\u201d\n\u201cWere you surprised\u201d\n\u201cWas I I don\u2019t remember.\u201d\n\u201cWhat did you say\u201d\nElsa laughed.",
    "She said\n\u201cWhat do you think I said After Amyas\u2014Meredith It would have\nbeen ridiculous It was stupid of him.",
    "He always was rather stupid.\u201d\nShe smiled suddenly.",
    "\u201cHe wanted you know to protect me\u2014to \u2018look after me\u2019\u2014that\u2019s\nhow he put it He thought like everybody else that the Assizes had been a\nterrible ordeal for me.",
    "And the reporters And the booing crowds And\nall the mud that was slung at me.\u201d\nShe brooded a minute.",
    "Then said\n\u201cPoor old Meredith Such an ass\u201d And laughed again.",
    "IV\nOnce again Hercule Poirot encountered the shrewd penetrating glance of\nMiss Williams and once again felt the years falling away and himself a\nmeek and apprehensive little boy.",
    "There was he explained a question he wished to ask.",
    "Miss Williams intimated her willingness to hear what the question\nwas.",
    "Poirot said slowly picking his words carefully\n\u201cAngela Warren was injured as a very young child.",
    "In my notes I find\ntwo references to that fact.",
    "In one of them it is stated that Mrs. Crale\nthrew a paperweight at the child.",
    "In the other that she attacked the baby\nwith a crowbar.",
    "Which of those versions is the right one\u201d\nMiss Williams replied briskly\n\u201cI never heard anything about a crowbar.",
    "The paperweight is the\ncorrect story.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cWho was your own informant\u201d\n\u201cAngela herself.",
    "She volunteered the information quite early.\u201d\n\u201cWhat did she say exactly\u201d\n\u201cShe touched her cheek and said \u2018Caroline did this when I was a\nbaby.",
    "She threw a paperweight at me.",
    "Never refer to it will you because\nit upsets her dreadfully.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cDid Mrs. Crale herself ever mention the matter to you\u201d\n\u201cOnly obliquely.",
    "She assumed that I knew the story.",
    "I remember her\nsaying once \u2018I know you think I spoil Angela but you see I always feel\nthere is nothing I can do to make up to her for what I did.\u2019 And on\nanother occasion she said \u2018To know you have permanently injured\nanother human being is the heaviest burden anyone could have to bear.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cThank you Miss Williams.",
    "That is all I wanted to know.\u201d\nCecilia Williams said sharply\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand you Mr. Poirot.",
    "You showed Carla my account of\nthe tragedy\u201d\nPoirot nodded.",
    "\u201cAnd yet you are still\u2014\u201d She stopped.",
    "Poirot said\n\u201cReflect a minute.",
    "If you were to pass a fishmonger\u2019s and saw twelve\nfish laid out on his slab you would think they were all real fish would\nyou not But one of them might be stuffed fish.\u201d\nMiss Williams replied with spirit\n\u201cMost unlikely and anyway\u2014\u201d\n\u201cAh unlikely yes but not impossible\u2014because a friend of mine once\ntook down a stuffed fish it was his trade you comprehend to compare it\nwith the real thing And if you saw a bowl of zinnias in a drawing room\nin December you would say that they were false\u2014but they might be real\nones flown home from Baghdad.\u201d\n\u201cWhat is the meaning of all this nonsense\u201d demanded Miss\nWilliams.",
    "\u201cIt is to show you that it is the eyes of the mind with which one really\nsees\u2026.\u201d\n\nV\nPoirot slowed up a little as he approached the big block of flats\noverlooking Regent\u2019s Park.",
    "Really when he came to think of it he did not want to ask Angela\nWarren any questions at all.",
    "The only question he did want to ask her\ncould wait\u2026.",
    "No it was really only his insatiable passion for symmetry that was\nbringing him here.",
    "Five people\u2014there should be five questions It was\nneater so.",
    "It rounded off the thing better.",
    "Ah well\u2014he would think of something.",
    "Angela Warren greeted him with something closely approaching\neagerness.",
    "She said\n\u201cHave you found out anything Have you got anywhere\u201d\nSlowly Poirot nodded his head in his best China mandarin manner.",
    "He said\n\u201cAt last I make progress.\u201d\n\u201cPhilip Blake\u201d It was halfway between statement and a question.",
    "\u201cMademoiselle I do not wish to say anything at present.",
    "The moment\nhas not yet come.",
    "What I will ask of you is to be so good as to come\ndown to Handcross Manor.",
    "The others have consented.\u201d\nShe said with a slight frown\n\u201cWhat do you propose to do Reconstruct something that happened\nsixteen years ago\u201d\n\u201cSee it perhaps from a clearer angle.",
    "You will come\u201d\nAngela Warren said slowly\n\u201cOh yes I\u2019ll come.",
    "It will be interesting to see all those people again.",
    "I shall see them now perhaps from a clearer angle as you put it than I\ndid then.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you will bring with you the letter that you showed me\u201d\nAngela Warren frowned.",
    "\u201cThat letter is my own.",
    "I showed it to you for a good and sufficient\nreason but I have no intention of allowing it to be read by strange and\nunsympathetic persons.\u201d\n\u201cBut you will allow yourself to be guided by me in this matter\u201d\n\u201cI will do nothing of the kind.",
    "I will bring the letter with me but I\nshall use my own judgement which I venture to think is quite as good as\nyours.\u201d\nPoirot spread out his hands in a gesture of resignation.",
    "He got up to\ngo.",
    "He said\n\u201cYou permit that I ask one little question\u201d\n\u201cWhat is it\u201d\n\n\f\u201cAt the time of the tragedy you had lately read had you not\nSomerset Maugham\u2019s The Moon and Sixpence\u201d\nAngela stared at him.",
    "Then she said\n\u201cI believe\u2014why yes that is quite true.\u201d She looked at him with frank\ncuriosity.",
    "\u201cHow did you know\u201d\n\u201cI want to show you mademoiselle that even in a small unimportant\nmatter I am something of a magician.",
    "There are things I know without\nhaving to be told.\u201d\n\n\f\fThree\nRECONSTRUCTION\n\nThe afternoon sun shone into the laboratory at Handcross Manor.",
    "Some\neasy chairs and a settee had been brought into the room but they served\nmore to emphasize its forlorn aspect than to furnish it.",
    "Slightly embarrassed pulling at his moustache Meredith Blake\ntalked to Carla in a desultory way.",
    "He broke off once to say \u201cMy dear\nyou are very like your mother\u2014and yet unlike her too.\u201d\nCarla asked \u201cHow am I like her and how unlike\u201d\n\u201cYou have her colouring and her way of moving but you are\u2014how\nshall I put it\u2014more positive than she ever was.\u201d\nPhilip Blake a scowl creasing over his forehead looked out of the\nwindow and drummed impatiently on the pane.",
    "He said\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the sense of all this A perfectly fine Saturday afternoon\u2014\u201d\nHercule Poirot hastened to pour oil on troubled waters.",
    "\u201cAh I apologize\u2014it is I know unpardonable to disarrange the golf.",
    "Mais voyons Mr. Blake this is the daughter of your best friend.",
    "You will\nstretch a point for her will you not\u201d\nThe butler announced \u201cMiss Warren.\u201d\nMeredith went to welcome her.",
    "He said \u201cIt\u2019s good of you to spare the\ntime Angela.",
    "You\u2019re busy I know.\u201d\nHe led her over to the window.",
    "Carla said \u201cHallo Aunt Angela.",
    "I read your article in The Times this\nmorning.",
    "It\u2019s nice to have a distinguished relative.\u201d She indicated the tall\nsquarejawed young man with the steady grey eyes.",
    "\u201cThis is John\nRattery.",
    "He and I\u2014hope\u2014to be married.\u201d\nAngela Warren said \u201cOh\u2014I didn\u2019t know\u2026.\u201d\nMeredith went to greet the next arrival.",
    "\u201cWell Miss Williams it\u2019s a good many years since we met.\u201d\nThin frail and indomitable the elderly governess advanced up the\nroom.",
    "Her eyes rested thoughtfully on Poirot for a minute then they\nwent to the tall squareshouldered figure in the wellcut tweeds.",
    "Angela Warren came forward to meet her and said with a smile \u201cI\nfeel like a schoolgirl again.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cI\u2019m very proud of you my dear\u201d said Miss Williams.",
    "\u201cYou\u2019ve done\nme credit.",
    "This is Carla I suppose She won\u2019t remember me.",
    "She was\ntoo young\u2026.\u201d\nPhilip Blake said fretfully \u201cWhat is all this Nobody told me\u2014\u201d\nHercule Poirot said \u201cI call it\u2014me\u2014an excursion into the past.",
    "Shall\nwe not all sit down Then we shall be ready when the last guest arrives.",
    "And when she is here we can proceed to our business\u2014to lay the\nghosts.\u201d\nPhilip Blake exclaimed \u201cWhat tomfoolery is this You\u2019re not going\nto hold a s\u00e9ance are you\u201d\n\u201cNo no.",
    "We are only going to discuss some events that happened\nlong ago\u2014to discuss them and perhaps to see more clearly the course\nof them.",
    "As to the ghosts they will not materialize but who is to say\nthey are not here in this room although we cannot see them.",
    "Who is to\nsay that Amyas and Caroline Crale are not here\u2014listening\u201d\nPhilip Blake said \u201cAbsurd nonsense\u2014\u201d and broke off as the door\nopened again and the butler announced Lady Dittisham.",
    "Elsa Dittisham came in with that faint bored insolence that was a\ncharacteristic of her.",
    "She gave Meredith a slight smile stared coldly at\nAngela and Philip and went over to a chair by the window a little apart\nfrom the others.",
    "She loosened the rich pale furs round her neck and let\nthem fall back.",
    "She looked for a minute or two about the room then at\nCarla and the girl stared back thoughtfully appraising the woman who\nhad wrought the havoc in her parents\u2019 lives.",
    "There was no animosity in\nher young earnest face only curiosity.",
    "Elsa said \u201cI am sorry if I am late Mr. Poirot.\u201d\n\u201cIt was very good of you to come madame.\u201d\nCecilia Williams snorted ever so slightly.",
    "Elsa met the animosity in\nher eyes with a complete lack of interest.",
    "She said\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have known you Angela.",
    "How long is it Sixteen years\u201d\nHercule Poirot seized his opportunity.",
    "\u201cYes it is sixteen years since the events of which we are to speak but\nlet me first tell you why we are here.\u201d\nAnd in a few simple words he outlined Carla\u2019s appeal to him and his\nacceptance of the task.",
    "He went on quickly ignoring the gathering storm visible on Philip\u2019s\nface and the shocked distaste on Meredith\u2019s.",
    "\u201cI accepted that commision\u2014I set to work to find out\u2014the truth.\u201d\n\n\fCarla Lemarchant in the big grandfather chair heard Poirot\u2019s words\ndimly from a distance.",
    "With her hand shielding her eyes she studied five faces\nsurreptitiously.",
    "Could she see any of these people committing murder\nThe exotic Elsa the redfaced Philip dear nice kind Mr. Meredith\nBlake that grim tartar of a governess the cool competent Angela\nWarren\nCould she\u2014if she tried hard\u2014visualize one of them killing someone\nYes perhaps\u2014but it wouldn\u2019t be the right kind of murder.",
    "She could\npicture Philip Blake in an outburst of fury strangling some women\u2014\nyes she could picture that\u2026And she could picture Meredith Blake\nthreatening a burglar with a revolver\u2014and letting it off by accident.",
    "And\nshe could picture Angela Warren also firing a revolver but not by\naccident.",
    "With no personal feeling in the matter\u2014the safety of the\nexpedition depended on it And Elsa in some fantastic castle saying\nfrom her couch of oriental silks \u201cThrow the wretch over the\nbattlements\u201d All wild fancies\u2014and not even in the wildest flight of\nfancy could she imagine little Miss Williams killing anybody at all\nAnother fantastic picture \u201cDid you ever kill anybody Miss Williams\u201d\n\u201cGo on with your arithmetic Carla and don\u2019t ask silly questions.",
    "To kill\nanybody is very wicked.\u201d\nCarla thought \u201cI must be ill\u2014and I must stop this.",
    "Listen you fool\nlisten to that little man who says he knows.\u201d\nHercule Poirot was talking.",
    "\u201cThat was my task\u2014to put myself in reverse gear as it were and go\nback through the years and discover what really happened.\u201d\nPhilip Blake said \u201cWe all know what happened.",
    "To pretend anything\nelse is a swindle\u2014that\u2019s what it is a barefaced swindle.",
    "You\u2019re getting\nmoney out of this girl on false pretences.\u201d\nPoirot did not allow himself to be angered.",
    "He said\n\u201cYou say we all know what happened.",
    "You speak without reflection.",
    "The accepted version of certain facts is not necessarily the true one.",
    "On\nthe face of it for instance you Mr. Blake disliked Caroline Crale.",
    "That\nis the accepted version of your attitude.",
    "But anyone with the least flair\nfor psychology can perceive at once that the exact opposite was the truth.",
    "You were always violently attracted towards Caroline Crale.",
    "You\nresented the fact and tried to conquer it by steadfastly telling yourself\nher defects and reiterating your dislike.",
    "In the same way Mr. Meredith\n\n\fBlake had a tradition of devotion to Caroline Crale lasting over many\nyears.",
    "In his story of the tragedy he represents himself as resenting\nAmyas Crale\u2019s conduct on her account but you have only to read\ncarefully between the lines and you will see that the devotion of a\nlifetime had worn itself thin and that it was the young beautiful Elsa\nGreer that was occupying his mind and thoughts.\u201d\nThere was a splutter from Meredith and Lady Dittisham smiled.",
    "Poirot went on.",
    "\u201cI mention these matters only as illustrations though they have their\nbearing on what happened.",
    "Very well then I start on my backward\njourney\u2014to learn everything I can about the tragedy.",
    "I will tell you how\nI set about it.",
    "I talked to the Counsel who defended Caroline Crale to the\nJunior Counsel for the Crown to the old solicitor who had known the\nCrale family intimately to the lawyer\u2019s clerk who had been in court\nduring the trial to the police officer in charge of the case\u2014and I came\nfinally to the five eyewitnesses who had been upon the scene.",
    "And from\nall of these I put together a picture\u2014a composite picture of a woman.",
    "And I learned these facts\n\u201cThat at no time did Caroline Crale protest her innocence except in\nthat one letter written to her daughter.",
    "\u201cThat Caroline Crale showed no fear in the dock that she showed in\nfact hardly any interest that she adopted throughout a thoroughly\ndefeatist attitude.",
    "That in prison she was quiet and serene.",
    "That in a letter\nshe wrote to her sister immediately after the verdict she expressed\nherself as acquiescent in the fate that had overtaken her.",
    "And in the\nopinion of everyone I talked to with one notable exception Caroline\nCrale was guilty.\u201d\nPhilip Blake nodded his head.",
    "\u201cOf course she was\u201d\nHercule Poirot said\n\u201cBut it was not my part to accept the verdict of others.",
    "I had to\nexamine the evidence for myself.",
    "To examine the facts and to satisfy\nmyself that the psychology of the case accorded itself with them.",
    "To do\nthis I went over the police files carefully and I also succeeded in getting\nfive people who were on the spot to write me out their own accounts of\nthe tragedy.",
    "These accounts were very valuable for they contained\ncertain matter which the police files could not give me\u2014that is to say A\ncertain conversations and incidents which from the police point of view\nwere not relevant B the opinions of the people themselves as to what\n\n\fCaroline Crale was thinking and feeling not admissible legally as\nevidence C certain facts which had been deliberately withheld from the\npolice.",
    "\u201cI was in a position now to judge the case for myself.",
    "There seems no\ndoubt whatever that Caroline Crale had ample motive for the crime.",
    "She\nloved her husband he had publicly admitted that he was about to leave\nher for another woman and by her own admission she was a jealous\nwoman.",
    "\u201cTo come from motives to means an empty scent bottle that had\ncontained coniine was found in her bureau drawer.",
    "There were no\nfingerprints upon it but hers.",
    "When asked about it by the police she\nadmitted taking it from this room we are in now.",
    "The coniine bottle here\nalso had her fingerprints upon it.",
    "I questioned Mr. Meredith Blake as to\nthe order in which the five people left this room on that day\u2014for it\nseemed to me hardly conceivable that anyone should be able to help\nthemselves to the poison whilst five people were in the room.",
    "The people\nleft the room in this order\u2014Elsa Greer Meredith Blake Angela Warren\nand Philip Blake Amyas Crale and lastly Caroline Crale.",
    "Moreover Mr.\nMeredith Blake has his back to the room whilst he was waiting for Mrs.\nCrale to come out so that it was impossible for him to see what she was\ndoing.",
    "She had that is to say the opportunity.",
    "I am therefore satisfied\nthat she did take the coniine.",
    "There is indirect confirmation of it.",
    "Mr.\nMeredith Blake said to me the other day \u201cI can remember standing here\nand smelling the jasmine through the open window.\u201d But the month was\nSeptember and the jasmine creeper outside that window would have\nfinished flowering.",
    "It is the ordinary jasmine which blooms in June and\nJuly.",
    "But the scent bottle found in her room and which contained the\ndregs of coniine had originally contained jasmine scent.",
    "I take it as\ncertain then that Mrs. Crale decided to steal the coniine and\nsurreptitiously emptied out the scent from a bottle she had in her bag.",
    "\u201cI tested that a second time the other day when I asked Mr. Blake to\nshut his eyes and try and remember the order of leaving the room.",
    "A\nwhiff of jasmine scent stimulated his memory immediately.",
    "We are all\nmore influenced by smell than we know.",
    "\u201cSo we come to the morning of the fatal day.",
    "So far the facts are not\nin dispute.",
    "Miss Greer\u2019s sudden revealing of the fact that she and Mr.\nCrale contemplate marriage Amyas Crale\u2019s confirmation of that and\n\n\fCaroline Crale\u2019s deep distress.",
    "None of these things depend on the\nevidence of one witness only.",
    "\u201cOn the following morning there is a scene between husband and\nwife in the library.",

    "And Miss Greer overheard it from the terrace outside.",
    "\u201cShe then heard Mr. Crale ask his wife to be reasonable.",
    "And she\nheard Mrs. Crale say \u201cSooner than let you go to that girl\u2014I\u2019ll kill you.\u201d\nSoon after this Amyas Crale comes out and brusquely tells Elsa Greer to\ncome down and pose for him.",
    "She gets a pullover and accompanies him.",
    "\u201cThere is nothing so far that seems psychologically incorrect.",
    "Every\none has behaved as they might be expected to behave.",
    "But we come now\nto something that is incongruous.",
    "\u201cMeredith Blake discovers his loss telephones his brother they meet\ndown at the landing stage and they come up past the Battery garden\nwhere Caroline Crale is having a discussion with her husband on the\nsubject of Angela\u2019s going to school.",

    "Husband and wife have a terrific scene ending in a distinct threat\non Caroline\u2019s part and yet twenty minutes or so later she goes down\nand starts a trivial domestic argument.\u201d\nPoirot turned to Meredith Blake.",
    "\u201cYou speak in your narrative of certain words you overheard Crale\nsay.",
    "These were \u2018It\u2019s all settled\u2014I\u2019ll see to her packing.\u2019 That is right\u201d\nMeredith Blake said \u201cIt was something like that\u2014yes.\u201d\nPoirot turned to Philip Blake.",
    "\u201cIs your recollection the same\u201d\nThe latter frowned.",
    "\u201cI didn\u2019t remember it till you say so\u2014but I do remember now.",
    "Something was said about packing\u201d\n\u201cSaid by Mr. Crale\u2014not Mrs. Crale\u201d\n\u201cAmyas said it.",
    "All I heard Caroline say was something about its\nbeing very hard on the girl.",
    "Anyway what does all this matter We all\nknow Angela was off to school in a day or two.\u201d\nPoirot said \u201cYou do not see the force of my objection.",
    "Why should\nAmyas Crale pack for the girl It is absurd that There was Mrs. Crale\nthere was Miss Williams there was a housemaid.",
    "It is a woman\u2019s job to\npack\u2014not a man\u2019s.\u201d\n\n\fPhilip Blake said impatiently\n\u201cWhat does it matter It\u2019s nothing to do with the crime.\u201d\n\u201cYou think not For me it was the first point that struck me as\nsuggestive.",
    "And it is immediately followed by another.",
    "Mrs. Crale a\ndesperate woman brokenhearted who has threatened her husband a\nshort while before and who is certainly contemplating either suicide or\nmurder now offers in the most amicable manner to bring her husband\ndown some iced beer.\u201d\nMeredith Blake said slowly \u201cThat isn\u2019t odd if she was contemplating\nmurder.",
    "Then surely it is just what she would do.",
    "Dissimulate\u201d\n\u201cYou think so She has decided to poison her husband she has\nalready got the poison.",

    "\u201cShe couldn\u2019t have done that.",
    "Somebody else might have drunk it.\u201d\n\u201cYes Elsa Greer.",

    "It has been said of her that she looks a little worried and\npreoccupied.",

    "\u201cYou do not object\u201d\nMiss Williams was rather pale.",
    "She said \u201cI did not pledge you to\nsecrecy.\u201d\nQuietly but with telling effect Poirot recounted what the governess\nhad seen.",

    "She said incredibly\n\u201cYou actually saw her do that\u201d\nPhilip Blake sprang up.",
    "\u201cBut that settles it\u201d he shouted.",
    "\u201cThat settles it once and for all.\u201d\nHercule Poirot looked at him mildly.",
    "He said \u201cNot necessarily.\u201d\nAngela Warren said sharply \u201cI don\u2019t believe it.\u201d There was a quick\nhostile glint in the glance she shot at the little governess.",

    "\u201cI\nam not accustomed Mr. Poirot to having my word doubted.\u201d\nHercule Poirot bowed his head.",

    "What you saw took place\nexactly as you say it did\u2014and because of what you saw I realized that\nCaroline Crale was not guilty\u2014could not possibly be guilty.\u201d\nFor the first time that tall anxiousfaced young man John Rattery\nspoke.",
    "He said \u201cI\u2019d be interested to know why you say that Mr. Poirot.\u201d\nPoirot turned to him.",
    "\u201cCertainly.",
    "I will tell you.",
    "What did Miss Williams see\u2014she saw\nCaroline Crale very carefully and anxiously wiping off fingerprints and\nsubsequently imposing her dead husband\u2019s fingerprints on the beer\nbottle.",
    "On the beer bottle mark.",
    "But the coniine was in the glass\u2014not in\nthe bottle.",

    "She thought the poison was in the bottle.\u201d\nMeredith objected \u201cBut why\u2014\u201d\nPoirot interrupted him in a flash.",
    "\u201cYes\u2014why Why did Caroline Crale try so desperately to establish\nthe theory of suicide The answer is\u2014must be\u2014quite simple.",
    "Because\nshe knew who had poisoned him and she was willing to do anything\u2014\nendure anything\u2014rather than let that person be suspected.",
    "\u201cThere is not far to go now.",
    "Who could that person be Would she\nhave shielded Philip Blake Or Meredith Or Elsa Greer Or Cecilia\nWilliams No there is only one person whom she would be willing to\nprotect at all costs.\u201d\nHe paused \u201cMiss Warren if you have brought your sister\u2019s last letter\nwith you I should like to read it aloud.\u201d\nAngela Warren said \u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cBut Miss Warren\u2014\u201d\nAngela got up.",
    "Her voice rang out cold as steel.",
    "\u201cI realize very well what you are suggesting.",
    "You are saying are you\nnot that I killed Amyas Crale and that my sister knew it.",
    "I deny that\nallegation utterly.\u201d\nPoirot said \u201cThe letter\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cThat letter was meant for my eyes alone.\u201d\nPoirot looked to where the two youngest people in the room stood\ntogether.",
    "Carla Lemarchant said \u201cPlease Aunt Angela won\u2019t you do as Mr.\nPoirot asks\u201d\nAngela Warren said bitterly \u201cReally Carla Have you no sense of\ndecency She was your mother\u2014you\u2014\u201d\nCarla\u2019s voice rang out clear and fierce.",
    "\u201cYes she was my mother.",
    "That\u2019s why I\u2019ve a right to ask you.",
    "I\u2019m\nspeaking for her.",
    "I want that letter read.\u201d\nSlowly Angela Warren took out the letter from her bag and handed it\nto Poirot.",
    "She said bitterly\n\u201cI wish I had never shown it to you.\u201d\nTurning away from them she stood looking out of the window.",
    "As Hercule Poirot read aloud Caroline Crale\u2019s last letter the shadows\nwere deepening in the corners of the room.",
    "Carla had a sudden feeling of\nsomeone in the room gathering shape listening breathing waiting.",
    "She\nthought \u201cShe\u2019s here\u2014my mother\u2019s here.",
    "Caroline\u2014Caroline Crale is\nhere in this room\u201d\nHercule Poirot\u2019s voice ceased.",
    "He said\n\u201cYou will all agree I think that that is a very remarkable letter.",
    "A\nbeautiful letter too but certainly remarkable.",
    "For there is one striking\nomission in it\u2014it contains no protestation of innocence.\u201d\nAngela Warren said without turning her head \u201cThat was\nunnecessary.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cYes Miss Warren it was unnecessary.",
    "Caroline Crale had no need to\ntell her sister that she was innocent\u2014because she thought her sister knew\nthat fact already\u2014knew it for the best of all reasons.",
    "All Caroline Crale\nwas concerned about was to comfort and reassure and to avert the\npossibility of a confession from Angela.",
    "She reiterates again and again\u2014\nIt\u2019s all right darling it\u2019s all right.\u201d\nAngela Warren said \u201cCan\u2019t you understand She wanted me to be\nhappy that\u2019s all.\u201d\n\u201cYes she wanted you to be happy that is abundantly clear.",
    "It is her\none preoccupation.",
    "She has a child but it is not that child of whom she is\nthinking\u2014that is to come later.",
    "No it is her sister who occupies her mind\nto the exclusion of everything else.",
    "Her sister must be reassured must be\nencouraged to live her life to be happy and successful.",
    "And so that the\nburden of acceptance may not be too great Caroline includes that one\nvery significant phrase \u2018One must pay one\u2019s debts.\u2019\n\u201cThat one phrase explains everything.",
    "It refers explicitly to the\nburden that Caroline has carried for so many years ever since in a fit of\nuncontrolled adolescent rage she hurled a paperweight at her baby sister\nand injured that sister for life.",
    "Now at last she has the opportunity to\npay the debt she owes.",
    "And if it is any consolation I will say to you all\nthat I earnestly believe that in the payment of that debt Caroline Crale\ndid achieve a peace and serenity greater than any she had ever known.",
    "Because of her belief that she was paying that debt the ordeal of trial\nand condemnation could not touch her.",
    "It is a strange thing to say of a\ncondemned murderess\u2014but she had everything to make her happy.",
    "Yes\nmore than you imagine as I will show you presently.",
    "\u201cSee how by this explanation everything falls into its place where\nCaroline\u2019s own reactions are concerned.",
    "Look at the series of events\nfrom her point of view.",
    "To begin with on the preceding evening an\nevent occurs which reminds her forcibly of her own undisciplined\ngirlhood.",
    "Angela throws a paperweight at Amyas Crale.",
    "That remember\nis what she herself did many years ago.",
    "Angela shouts out that she\nwishes Amyas was dead.",
    "Then on the next morning Caroline comes\ninto the little conservatory and finds Angela tampering with the beer.",
    "Remember Miss Williams\u2019s words \u2018Angela was there.",
    "She looked\nguilty\u2026\u2019 Guilty of playing truant was what Miss Williams meant but to\nCaroline Angela\u2019s guilty face as she was caught unawares would have\na different meaning.",
    "Remember that on at least one occasion before\n\n\fAngela had put things in Amyas\u2019s drink.",
    "It was an idea which might\nreadily occur to her.",
    "\u201cCaroline takes the bottle that Angela gives her and goes down with it\nto the Battery.",
    "And there she pours it out and gives it to Amyas and he\nmakes a face as he tosses it off and utters those significant words\n\u2018Everything tastes foul today.\u2019\n\u201cCaroline has no suspicions then\u2014but after lunch she goes down to\nthe Battery and finds her husband dead\u2014and she has no doubt at all but\nthat he has been poisoned.",
    "She had not done it.",
    "Who then has And the\nwhole thing comes over her with a rush\u2014Angela\u2019s threats Angela\u2019s face\nstooping over the beer and caught unawares\u2014guilty\u2014guilty\u2014guilty.",
    "Why has the child done it As a revenge on Amyas perhaps not meaning\nto kill just to make him ill or sick Or has she done it for her Caroline\u2019s\nsake Has she realized and resented Amyas\u2019s desertion of her sister\nCaroline remembers\u2014oh so well\u2014her own undisciplined violent\nemotions at Angela\u2019s age.",
    "And only one thought springs to her mind.",
    "How can she protect Angela Angela handled that bottle\u2014Angela\u2019s\nfingerprints will be on it.",
    "She quickly wipes it and polishes it.",
    "If only\neverybody can be got to believe it is suicide.",
    "If Amyas\u2019s fingerprints are\nthe only ones found.",
    "She tries to fit his dead fingers round the bottle\u2014\nworking desperately\u2014listening for someone to come\u2026.",
    "\u201cOnce take that assumption as true and everything from then on fits\nin.",
    "Her anxiety about Angela all along her insistence on getting her\naway keeping her out of touch with what was going on.",
    "Her fear of\nAngela\u2019s being questioned unduly by the police.",
    "Finally her\noverwhelming anxiety to get Angela out of England before the trial\ncomes on.",
    "Because she is always terrified that Angela might break down\nand confess.\u201d\n\n\f\fFour\nTRUTH\n\nSlowly Angela Warren swung round.",
    "Her eyes hard and contemptuous\nranged over the faces turned towards her.",
    "She said\n\u201cYou\u2019re blind fools\u2014all of you.",
    "Don\u2019t you know that if I had done it I\nwould have confessed I\u2019d never have let Caroline suffer for what I\u2019d\ndone.",
    "Never\u201d\nPoirot said\n\u201cBut you did tamper with the beer.\u201d\n\u201cI Tamper with the beer\u201d\nPoirot turned to Meredith Blake.",
    "\u201cListen monsieur.",
    "In your account here of what happened you\ndescribe having heard sounds in this room which is below your\nbedroom on the morning of the crime.\u201d\nBlake nodded.",
    "\u201cBut it was only a cat.\u201d\n\u201cHow do you know it was a cat\u201d\n\u201cI\u2014I can\u2019t remember.",
    "But it was a cat.",
    "I am quite sure it was a cat.",
    "The window was open just wide enough for a cat to get through.\u201d\n\u201cBut it was not fixed in that position.",
    "The sash moves freely.",
    "It could\nhave been pushed up and a human being could have got in and out.\u201d\n\u201cYes but I know it was a cat.\u201d\n\u201cYou did not see a cat\u201d\nBlake said perplexedly and slowly\n\u201cNo I did not see it\u2014\u201d He paused frowning.",
    "\u201cAnd yet I know.\u201d\n\u201cI will tell you why you know presently.",
    "In the meantime I put this\npoint to you.",
    "Someone could have come up to the house that morning\nhave got into your laboratory taken something from the shelf and gone\nagain without your seeing them.",
    "Now if that someone had come over\nfrom Alderbury it could not have been Philip Blake nor Elsa Greer nor\nAmyas Crale nor Caroline Crale.",
    "We know quite well what all those four\nwere doing.",
    "That leaves Angela Warren and Miss Williams.",
    "Miss\nWilliams was over here\u2014you actually met her as you went out.",
    "She told\nyou then that she was looking for Angela.",
    "Angela had gone bathing\n\n\fearly but Miss Williams did not see her in the water nor anywhere on\nthe rocks.",
    "She could swim across to this side easily\u2014in fact she did so\nlater in the morning when she was bathing with Philip Blake.",
    "I suggest\nthat she swam across here came up to the house got in through the\nwindow and took something from the shelf.\u201d\nAngela Warren said \u201cI did nothing of the kind\u2014not\u2014at least\u2014\u201d\n\u201cAh\u201d Poirot gave a yelp of triumph.",
    "\u201cYou have remembered.",
    "You\ntold me did you not that to play a malicious joke on Amyas Crale you\npinched some of what you called \u2018the cat stuff\u2019\u2014that is how you put it\n\u2014\u201d\nMeredith Blake said sharply\n\u201cValerian Of course.\u201d\n\u201cExactly.",
    "That is what made you sure in your mind that it was a cat\nwho had been in the room.",
    "Your nose is very sensitive.",
    "You smelled the\nfaint unpleasant odour of valerian without knowing perhaps that you\ndid so\u2014but it suggested to your subconscious mind \u2018Cat.\u2019 Cats love\nvalerian and will go anywhere for it.",
    "Valerian is particularly nasty to\ntaste and it was your account of it the day before which made\nmischievous Miss Angela plan to put some in her brotherinlaw\u2019s beer\nwhich she knew he always tossed down his throat in a draught.\u201d\nAngela Warren said wonderingly \u201cWas it really that day I remember\ntaking it perfectly.",
    "Yes and I remember getting out the beer and Caroline\ncoming in and nearly catching me Of course I remember\u2026But I\u2019ve\nnever connected it with that particular day.\u201d\n\u201cOf course not\u2014because there was no connection in your mind.",
    "The\ntwo events were entirely dissimilar to you.",
    "One was on a par with other\nmischievous pranks\u2014the other was a bombshell of tragedy arriving\nwithout warning and succeeding in banishing all lesser incidents from\nyour mind.",

    "etc.",
    "to put it in Amyas\u2019s drink.\u2019 You did not say you had\nactually done so.\u201d\n\u201cNo because I never did.",

    "Not as the result of a\nmalicious joke nor in any other way.",
    "If I had I would never have kept\n\n\fsilence.\u201d\nMiss Williams said sharply\n\u201cOf course you wouldn\u2019t my dear.\u201d She looked at Hercule Poirot.",

    "A very\nold situation.",
    "Two women and one man.",

    "But this time the woman did.",
    "She was not you see a\nwoman at all.",
    "She was a girl and in Caroline Crale\u2019s words she was\nterribly sincere\u2026She may have been hardboiled and sophisticated in\nspeech but in love she was frighteningly singleminded.",
    "Because she\nherself had a deep and overmastering passion for Amyas Crale she\nassumed that he had the same for her.",
    "She assumed without any question\nthat their passion was for life.",

    "When Philip Blake saw her in the hall and heard her murmur to\nherself \u2018It\u2019s too cruel\u2019 it was of Elsa she was thinking.",
    "\u201cAs for Crale he came out of the library found Elsa with Philip\nBlake and brusquely ordered her down to go on with the sitting.",
    "What\nhe did not know was that Elsa Greer had been sitting just outside the\nlibrary window and had overheard everything.",
    "And the account she gave\nlater of that conversation was not the true one.",
    "There is only her word for\nit remember.",
    "\u201cImagine the shock it must have been to her to hear the truth brutally\nspoken\n\n\f\u201cOn the previous afternoon Meredith Blake has told us that whilst he\nwas waiting for Caroline to leave this room he was standing in the\ndoorway with his back to the room.",
    "He was talking to Elsa Greer.",
    "That\nmeans that she would have been facing him and that she could see\nexactly what Caroline was doing over his shoulder\u2014and that she was the\nonly person who could do so.",
    "\u201cShe saw Caroline take that poison.",
    "She said nothing but she\nremembered it as she sat outside the library window.",
    "\u201cWhen Amyas Crale came out she made the excuse of wanting a\npullover and went up to Caroline Crale\u2019s room to look for that poison.",
    "Women know where other women are likely to hide things.",
    "She found it\nand being careful not to obliterate any fingerprints or to leave her own\nshe drew off the fluid into a fountainpen filler.",
    "\u201cThen she came down again and went off with Crale to the Battery\ngarden.",
    "And presently no doubt she poured him out some beer and he\ntossed it down in his usual way.",
    "\u201cMeanwhile Caroline Crale was seriously disturbed.",
    "When she saw\nElsa come up to the house this time really to fetch a pullover Caroline\nslipped quickly down to the Battery garden and tackled her husband.",
    "What he is doing is shameful She won\u2019t stand for it It\u2019s unbelievably\ncruel and hard on the girl Amyas irritable at being interrupted says it\u2019s\nall settled\u2014when the picture is done he\u2019ll send the girl packing \u2018It\u2019s all\nsettled\u2014I\u2019ll send her packing.",
    "I tell you.\u2019\n\u201cAnd then they hear the footsteps of the two Blakes and Caroline\ncomes out and slightly embarrassed murmurs something about Angela\nand school and having a lot to do and by a natural association of ideas\nthe two men judge the conversation they have overheard refers to\nAngela and \u2018I\u2019ll send her packing\u2019 becomes \u2018I\u2019ll see to her packing.\u2019\n\u201cAnd Elsa pullover in hand comes down the path cool and smiling\nand takes up the pose once more.",
    "\u201cShe has counted no doubt upon Caroline\u2019s being suspected and the\nconiine bottle being found in her room.",
    "But Caroline now plays into her\nhands completely.",
    "She brings down some iced beer and pours it out for\nher husband.",
    "\u201cAmyas tosses it off making a face and says \u2018Everything tastes foul\ntoday.\u2019\n\u201cDo you not see how significant that remark is Everything tastes\nfoul Then there has been something else before that beer that has tasted\n\n\funpleasant and the taste of which is still in his mouth.",
    "And one other\npoint.",
    "Philip Blake speaks of Crale\u2019s staggering a little and wonders \u2018if\nhe has been drinking.\u2019 But that slight stagger was the first sign of the\nconiine working and that means that it had already been administered to\nhim some time before Caroline brought him the iced bottle of beer.",
    "\u201cAnd so Elsa Greer sat on the grey wall and posed and since she\nmust keep him from suspecting until it was too late she talked to Amyas\nCrale brightly and naturally.",
    "Presently she saw Meredith on the bench\nabove and waved her hand to him and acted her part even more\nthoroughly for his behalf.",
    "\u201cAnd Amyas Crale a man who detested illness and refused to give in\nto it painted doggedly on till his limbs failed and his speech thickened\nand he sprawled there on that bench helpless but with his mind still\nclear.",
    "\u201cThe bell sounded from the house and Meredith left the bench to\ncome down to the Battery.",
    "I think in that brief moment Elsa left her place\nand ran across to the table and dropped the last few drops of the poison\ninto the beer glass that held that last innocent drink.",
    "She got rid of the\ndropper on the path up to the house\u2014crushing it to powder.",
    "Then she\nmet Meredith in the doorway.",
    "\u201cThere is a glare there coming in out of the shadows.",
    "Meredith did\nnot see very clearly\u2014only his friend sprawled in a familiar position and\nsaw his eyes turn from the picture in what he described as a malevolent\nglare.",
    "\u201cHow much did Amyas know or guess How much his conscious\nmind knew we cannot tell but his hand and his eye were faithful.\u201d\nHercule Poirot gestured towards the picture on the wall.",
    "\u201cI should have known when I first saw that picture.",
    "For it is a very\nremarkable picture.",
    "It is the picture of a murderess painted by her victim\n\u2014it is the picture of a girl watching her lover die\u2026.\u201d\n\n\f\fFive\nAFTERMATH\n\nIn the silence that followed\u2014a horrified appalled silence the sunset\nslowly flickered away the last gleam left the window where it had rested\non the dark head and pale furs of the woman sitting there.",
    "Elsa Dittisham moved and spoke.",
    "She said\n\u201cTake them away Meredith.",
    "Leave me with Mr. Poirot.\u201d\nShe sat there motionless until the door shut behind them.",
    "Then she\nsaid \u201cYou are very clever aren\u2019t you\u201d\nPoirot did not answer.",
    "She said \u201cWhat do you expect me to do Confess\u201d\nHe shook his head.",
    "Elsa said\n\u201cBecause I shall do nothing of the kind And I shall admit nothing.",
    "But what we say here together does not matter.",
    "Because it is only a\nquestion of your word against mine.\u201d\n\u201cExactly.\u201d\n\u201cI want to know what you are going to do\u201d\nHercule Poirot said\n\u201cI shall do everything I can to induce the authorities to grant a\nposthumous free pardon to Caroline Crale.\u201d\nElsa laughed.",
    "She said \u201cHow absurd To be given a free pardon for\nsomething you didn\u2019t do.\u201d Then she said \u201cWhat about me\u201d\n\u201cI shall lay my conclusion before the necessary people.",
    "If they decide\nthere is the possibility of making out a case against you then they may\nact.",
    "I will tell you in my opinion there is not sufficient evidence\u2014there\nare only inferences not facts.",
    "Moreover they will not be anxious to\nproceed against anyone in your position unless there is ample\njustification for such a course.\u201d\nElsa said\n\u201cI shouldn\u2019t care.",
    "If I were standing in the dock fighting for my life\n\u2014there might be something in that\u2014something alive\u2014exciting.",
    "I might\n\u2014enjoy it.\u201d\n\u201cYour husband would not.\u201d\nShe stared at him.",
    "\u201cDo you think I care in the least what my husband would feel\u201d\n\u201cNo I do not.",
    "I do not think you have ever in your life cared about\nwhat any other person would feel.",
    "If you had you might be happier.\u201d\nShe said sharply\n\u201cWhy are you sorry for me\u201d\n\u201cBecause my child you have so much to learn.\u201d\n\u201cWhat have I got to learn\u201d\n\u201cAll the grownup emotions\u2014pity sympathy understanding.",
    "The\nonly things you know\u2014have ever known\u2014are love and hate.\u201d\nElsa said\n\u201cI saw Caroline take the coniine.",
    "I thought she meant to kill herself.",
    "That would have simplified things.",
    "And then the next morning I found\nout.",
    "He told her that he didn\u2019t care a button about me\u2014he had cared but\nit was all over.",
    "Once he\u2019d finished the picture he\u2019d send me packing.",
    "She\u2019d nothing to worry about he said.",
    "\u201cAnd she\u2014was sorry for me\u2026Do you understand what that did to\nme I found the stuff and I gave it to him and I sat there watching him\ndie.",
    "I\u2019ve never felt so alive so exultant so full of power.",
    "I watched him\ndie\u2026.\u201d\nShe flung out her hands.",
    "\u201cI didn\u2019t understand that I was killing myself\u2014not him.",
    "Afterwards I\nsaw her caught in a trap\u2014and that was no good either.",
    "I couldn\u2019t hurt her\n\u2014she didn\u2019t care\u2014she escaped from it all\u2014half the time she wasn\u2019t\nthere.",
    "She and Amyas both escaped\u2014they went somewhere where I\ncouldn\u2019t get at them.",
    "But they didn\u2019t die.",
    "I died.\u201d\nElsa Dittisham got up.",
    "She went across to the door.",
    "She said again\n\u201cI died\u2026.\u201d\nIn the hall she passed two young people whose life together was just\nbeginning.",
    "The chauffeur held open the door of the car.",
    "Lady Dittisham got in\nand the chauffeur wrapped the fur rug round her knees."
